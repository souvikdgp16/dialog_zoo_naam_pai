<user0> you sound very centered . i like my life , my family doesn t seem to .
<user0> perhaps . but i live a life of solitude . i miss family .
<user0> i like solitude too . maybe that s why i m infatuated with time and watches .
<user0> time given physical form is indeed intriguing . but meditation is my infatuation .

<user0> you should start hiding it ! i come a large family and i sometimes do the same .
<user0> i tried hiding it in the peas , but my wife found it .
<user0> maybe you will need to sneak off to the ice cream shop alone sometimes .
<user0> its easily done on the way to clients houses , plumbers are always on the go .
<user0> there are not any ice cream shops near me , i live in a very small town .
<user0> we go on the way to the parks too , in the next town .
<user0> that sounds great ! do you live in a large city ? that is my dream .
