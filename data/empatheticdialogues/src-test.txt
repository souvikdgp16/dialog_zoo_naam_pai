<user0> When I was a kid, I went to this group with other kids my age, it was in a big gym. There were kids of different ages, and one of the kids (8 years old or so) was picking on the littler kids. So, when he had his back turned, I looped him with a hoola hoop and tripped him so he fell flat on his face.

I had to watch for a moment in awe, before I realized he was getting up and I was about to get smacked. So, I ran towards where the parents were seated, stopped when I turned the corner, and walked calmly over to my mom, taking a seat on her lap. I looked innocent as could be as the mean kid came around the corner, and I forced myself to sit still so that when he smacked me in the face with the hoola hoop, I looked like a helpless victim.

If this new guy can do something I could walk properly again!

It's pretty painless..people killed my child and almost me..

I was also embarrassed that I had let that happen and I learned from it!

<user1> I once had a long walk home from the railway station with two very heavy bags. It turned out that another person had also missed the last bus and had to walk much of the journey with me as his home was in the same direction as mine.

He didn't disappoint, he helped me get home earlier and without a bad back; while the kindness of strangers made what a potentially bad night to a reasonably pleasant one - all down to trust!

<user0> I remember being on holiday and trying to find a way to watch an F1 race. I caught the beginning of the race in a bar before it closed and saw that my favourite driver had had a puncture and fallen to last place. My mate asked me what the chances were of him winning from that position? I said 1000 to 1. By the time we were back at the hostel, I learned that he had indeed won the race in what many believe was the greatest single event in the sport's history!

<user1> Speaking of kids in school, I just found out my son got a B in his world history class at the end of the previous school year. I can't believe it. __eou__ <user0> That's great!!  History is so important I think and so few kids really grasp it well.  Congrats to him for a job well done! __eou__ <user1> No no, see, it was the first grade below an A that he's ever made. I honestly thought I had the next Einstein on my hands. Now I guess I'll have to settle for...above average, I guess. :(
