<user1> Did you suffer any injuries?
<user0> No I wasn't hit. It turned out they were drunk. I felt guilty but realized it was his fault.
<user1> Why did you feel guilty? People really shouldn't drive drunk.
<user0> I don't know I was new to driving and hadn't experienced anything like that. I felt like my horn made him swerve into the water barrels.
<user0> Yeah i wanted to tell you about the time i was hit by a drunk driver im so happy to still be alive after that experience
<user1> Oh my goodness, that's very scary! I hope you are okay now and the drunk driver was punished for his actions?
<user0> Yeah he was punished hes in jail still
<user0> sorry to hear! do you have any idea about the break up? did you think about it ?
<user1> Yes we decided together with our minds, and know i come home and feel so distant from the world
<user0> sorry again! hope you'll get relief from this sadness. Please concentrate on your interests to divert your mind from this.
<user0> Which Concert?
<user1> The U2 concert. Tickets were really expensive and I never thought we would be able to go, but somehow we did!!!
<user0> Wow, that's awesome! I have never been to an actual concert.
<user0> Ugh, those articles always get me too... :( What was wrong with her? 
<user1> she was born premature at home, she had hard time breathing on her own but instead of taking her to the doctor parents were just praying
<user0> Jeez! Its so unfortunate... very sad really. 
<user1> yes! And i do believe in God and prayers but goodness gracious please take your children to the hospital and let God heal them THROUGH doctors
<user1> That is nice of you. What did you do?
<user0> i was singing nursery songs :)
<user1> Which one?
<user0> "If you happy and you know it" :)
<user0> He will, I have faith.
<user1> thank you so much!
<user0> No problem. What kind of work does he do?
<user1> he is an armed guard
<user1> Thats not good. Do you own a gun?
<user0> I do! I want to be able to protect my son
<user1> That is always number one goal.
<user1> 3 years is a long time. How come?
<user0> I moved to the US and they stayed in my homecountry
<user1> Oh I see. They must miss you, too.
<user1> That isn't very nice.
<user0> Yeah he got caught in someones pics on Facebook. Never lie and then go out with people who like to take pictures.
<user1> Yes. I do not have a Facebook.
<user0> Good idea. i don't like social media that much. It can get you in to trouble fast, even when expressing your opinions.
<user0> Thats horrible.
<user1> Yeah i had my hopes reall high and then i left empty handed, such a terrible feeling!
<user0> Yes I do not like walmart.
<user1> Yes, i guess walmart and the rest of false advertisement in the US, the look in my daugther eyes when i came home empty handed
<user1> Thats horrible. Did you tell on him?
<user0> I struggled with it, but my friend was in a really bad spot, with no income and raising her grandchild, he was the financial supporter. So, I didn't tell her, as I knew it would really hurt her in several ways, plus she really loves him!
<user1> Thats a tough situation.
<user1> I guess it makes you appreciate things you used to take for granted, lol. But it doesn't last forever and is worth it. 
<user0> i totally agree with you!
<user1> That's a full time job raising a human
<user1> Oh, I'm sure you are lonely. Maybe you can join some kind of club that lets you meet new friends?
<user0> i was thinking about it! I wanted to join a group for local moms
<user1> That's a good idea! This way you can also meet friends for yourself, but also maybe meet new friend's for your children to hang out with while you do with their moms!
<user1> oh man. i'm all about discipline! I don't like spoiled bratty kids
<user0> Me either! I have two of my own children, and I would have never let them get away with that kind of behavior when they were his age. I just don't understand those kind of parents@!
<user1> yes, i've heard some parents don't ever say no to their kids. makes no sense
<user1> ok
<user0> Ugh I hate bugs with a passion, they are so creepy
<user0> Did things end amicably? I hope everything is good now!
<user1> Yes, they ended somewhat well, but there were tense moments. I am glad she's doing well, but I miss her.
<user0> I understand that, I hope things work out well for you both in the end!
<user1> Thank you! That means a lot.
<user1> That is a very blessed day. It is something you will never forget.
<user0> Obviously there are the demands of a new child -- but that feeling of finally meeting someone you waited so long for, and the love surrounding the whole situation. Truly something to remember.
<user1> Yes, I couldn't agree more. It is remarkable how your feeling suddenly change.
<user1> I bet that must have been nerve wracking until it happened.
<user0> Absolutely. You go from scared and desperate to grateful and optimistic in one quick moment! It's not a situation I wish to be in again.
<user1> Oh I'm sure. I would not like to be in a situation like that. Good thing everything worked out for you.
<user1> Oh really? What happened with your family and friend then?
<user0> My friend lost her parents and siblings in a fire and their family was very close to mine. So seeing her go through the grief made me realize how thankful I should be 
<user1> Oh wow, that's awful. Stuff like that really teaches you to appreciate what you've got and to not take it for granted.
<user0> Yes definitely. Never take anything for granted as you never know when it will be taken away from you
<user0> I agree, someimes we just know
<user1> It is a "knowing" -- and a flowing! When something is right, it just feels easier to go with it -- like you're being led, even if you might not fully know to where.
<user0> exactly, i get that entirely!
<user0> That's great! How did they surprise you?
<user1> I was studying in my bedroom for a couple of hours straight with headphones on and then my mom called me to the living room for dinner and when I went out the whole place was decorated and everyone was there
<user0> That is so sweet of them, I hope you enjoyed it!
<user0> Awww, That sucks man. Hopefully they don't say mean things to you about being lonely.
<user1> Sometimes they joke about it and obviously I make it look like its totally fine cause I dont want to give them the impression that I am lonely but it does hurt sometimes
<user0> Well i used to be lonely a lot but i eventually found someone. I think you will too.
<user0> Yeah that is always odd to me, before they can talk they are already unique!
<user1> One was pacifier, one was fingers. One wanted to co-sleep, one liked her space. One liked facing *out* in the Baby Bjorn carrier, one liked cocooning in a sling!
<user0> That is how it goes, sometimes you can just figure them out immediately
<user0> I understand that one,they are my favorite place to eat
<user1> Mine too. So I drive there and pull in the parking lot and it's completely empty. I then realized it was Sunday.
<user0> That has happened to me too many times to count
<user0> That must have been and intense and emotional moment for you.
<user1> Yes it definitely was. I went with intentions to teach the kid a few things but I ended up learning lots more from him 
<user0> Uau, what a surreal moment.I always believe kids have a lot to teach us.
<user0> I'm sure it will! I didn't get along with my dad until i became an adult.
<user1> That's always good to hear. But in the moment -- argh, my *heart*. How did your mom maneuver the differences between y'all? Did that wear on her?
<user0> Yes it did. I believe she just waited it out and tried to neutralize the conversation when we were together. 
<user1> But in the meantime -- the unspoken strain is NOT fun. But I'm glad to hear about a happy ending -- thank you for that!
<user1> Where you not secure in your self?
<user0> Well, like a lot of 6th graders I was aware of *not* wanting to be an outcast for any reason. And unfortunately, she was. As an adult of course, my heart squeezes for *all* the kids we were!
<user1> You can track her down to say sorry, or would that be creepy?
<user0> Unfortunately, she died. I only found out when Facebook first came out, and her brother and I "friended" one another.
<user1> Wow, so your going to take being a bad person to the grave. Maybe you'll see her in the next life?
<user1> Lucky you! That is rare. Maybe one day people will think of you like that?
<user0> That's a very kind statement, and certainly what I would strive for. And it's the rarity that *inspires* me. That should be the norm, not the exception! THAT'S what I'd like to inspire in people. How about you?
<user1> I have something totally different. My boss is clueless to the world and have no business being a leader. 
<user0> That is soul-sapping. What do you do to inspire yourself, and not let that kind of behavior drag you down?
<user1> Well I've been in the business all my life and have worked for some great people. So I pull from what I learned from them.
<user1> It's crazy how quickly kiddos grow! Even in a few weeks time! Do you see your friend and her baby often?
<user0> It had been about 8 weeks - I don't get out her way often, even though we live 30 minutes away.
<user1> That is how life goes! Different schedules and demands -- I'm sure she's so thrilled when she *does* get to see you!
<user0> Yes!  I got to be 'auntie' for a bit and help change her and get her fed and down for a nap while my friend had a chance to toss laundry in the wash.  It was a good day for everyone!
<user0> Wow, that is an amazing accomplishment!  Congratulations!  You gotta be feeling like you're on top of the world after that!
<user1> Ah, it was the best! Plus it helped that I purposely chose an amazing destination in which to run it -- it was the Venice Marathon!
<user0> My first thought was "California" but then there's Venice [Italy] and then either way, that's an amazing destination!
<user1> We were living overseas at the times -- the most impressive part was crossing the Grand Canal over a pontoon of boats to finish the marathon ;-)
<user0> Oh, wow.  Not only to be able to do all the running but to view the scenery!
<user0> I'm sorry to hear that! How did you find out? 
<user1> She just started treating me differently all of a sudden. And now she is going to be moving away soon.
<user0> That's a real bummer, but as they say, there are plenty of fish in the sea!
<user0> I feel the same way.
<user1> How do you channel the anger? Obviously, it too easily turns into the same kind of negative emotion I'm upset about -- so that can feel hypocritical!
<user0> I practice boxing. I love to punch the sandbags.It is very therapeutic.
<user1> Are you ever tempted to put anyone's face on the punching bag?! Ha! (Kidding/not kidding!)
<user1> Oh no that is terrible!  How did your daughter take it?
<user0> She was around 11, so she took it very hard. I went ahead and let her stay home from school, as I knew she wouldn't do well that day.
<user1> Oh poor thing.  I hope she is doing better now.  Losing a pet is extremely hard!
<user1> ooo they are gonna love it, just its expensive, I remember when it was only $20 to get in.
<user0> Same! I was excited because I grew up going there. My grandparents lived in Tucson, and we would spend the summers with them -- the most exciting part being our drive to Disneyland each year!
<user1> Which one are you going to California or Florida ?
<user0> California! Old school ;-) They've kept so much of the original, while adding lots of new attractions.
<user0> Cool.  Somethings never change.  What did you reflect upon?
<user1> We spoke about our recent lives. Apparently he is in the market for a new car.
<user0> Yeah, I miss my dad.  He died several years ago.  What kind of car is he looking for?
<user0> I'm trying to get into it. we have our first baby on the way and need to reorganize everything. Do you have tips? 
<user1> Labels and Bins can be your best friend!  Especially with a new baby.  
<user0> My big thing is i'm like O' I may need that leave it out of the tote box. Before I know it I have more stuff laying around then when I started.
<user0> Well, sometimes people are busy and don't have the time to check emails
<user1> It would be great if there was a way we could all tell the best way to reach someone -- I know some people prefer texts to emails -- but if you're in a work situation, how do you ensure communication?
<user0> Text and emails are still the best option., until a nw way is created.
<user0> Isn't that what sisters are for?  What were you guys upset about?
<user1> I'm not so sure. We just had a discussion that heated and became an argument with tempers flying.
<user0> Maybe once you feel like you can bring it up again, you can try to approach the topic from another angle.
<user0> Congratulations! Where did you travel from and where did you end up?
<user1> From Santa Fe to Hong Kong -- ultimately a fantastic adventure. And I ended up with a wonderful group of friends. Expats bond quickly!
<user0> That must have been quite the culture shock, glad it all worked out though!
<user0> I know, that actually happens to me sometimes! Last year I didn't get accepted into this fellowship and for a couple of weeks I was underestimating myself a lot.
<user1> That's perfectly natural. You sound like the kind of person, though, that quickly regained their bearings. Disappointments like that usually come with some *good* lessons.
<user0> Yea for sure, I definitely learned that sometimes life just works in a funny way. When's the last time you have been really disappointed? 
<user0> I totally understand why he was mad. Why did you tell her?
<user1> Yeah thats a good question.  I totally deserved him being mad.  I just felt bad for him b/c he was so busy that day and I didn't want him to have one more thing on his plate I guess
<user0> I guess he wanted to be available if she needed him.
<user0> What is a back neighbor? And that is crazy!
<user1> Yes, she lived several house back and she didn't know me, until after she did that! She knew me then, but after I talked to her, she apologized to both of us. 
<user0> Oh my! I'm glad she apologized!
<user0> I understand. I am think the same thing. What is your health issue?
<user1> Happily, I don't have one! It's more seeing family and friends and the situations they're in. Not everything can be helped -- but there are some things we can all do to take care of ourselves, you know?
<user0> Yes, we should try to yourself heathy
<user0> Oh, it sure is, I feel the same way. They grow up so fast! 
<user1> Are your kids adults now?
<user0> One of them is! I have an 18 year old and a 12 year old.
<user1> I have an 18 year old as well -- I don't know about you, but it's hard to consider her an adult sometimes!
<user1> I bet you were beautiful on that day. :) I hope that confidence has carried on since then!
<user0> I really try but it's hard to replicate that day for sure.
<user1> It would be hard to replicate that day for sure, but I bet you have a lot to be confident about. You got this!
<user1> I bet it's tough. A regular income is nice but the freedom you get from working for yourselfs is better. 
<user0> We found a pretty good balance in that I have a part-time job that I *love* -- and that comes with benefits like insurance. That's a big worry addressed, right there.
<user1> Your so lucky. Insurance is my number one worry every month. 
<user0> I am sorry, because I absolutely know that concern. I truly hope you find a resolution to that.
<user0> Oh ya? What happened?? I'm intrigued
<user1> Well, right after she gave me a big hug, she introduced me to her new boyfriend.
<user0> Woah plot twist. She brought him along to meet you? 
<user1> I know right! No warning or anything. He turned out to be a nice guy, but I thought it was a little misleading on her part.
<user1> OH I love the beach!!  Which beach are you going to go to?
<user0> We are going to be staying at Miramar Beach in Florida, about an  hour Panama City Beach. The view is amazing from our balcony and we are so ready!
<user1> PCB is where we always go! If you want to drive a little bit, go to HUNTS in PCB - it's off the beaten path but THE best seafood and prices - just go early (like 4oclock) for dinner or you won't get in!!
<user1> Why didn't you go?
<user0> Well, we had initially agreed to meet at 11. Wouldn't you know it, she didn't end up returning my text until 3PM!
<user1> Is she always a flake? Maybe time for a new friend?
<user1> Did he do anything to you and your mom?
<user0> Well I knew he was following us and so I asked the manager to walk us out to the car and when he did we saw the guy come out again from between the two buildings b/c he was waiting on us.  so scary!
<user1> I am glad that nothing happened.
<user1> No, you didn't tell me! What happened?
<user0> She's 45 minutes late to our anniversary dinner. I don't know what happened to me but I called and left an angry message. Turns out, she had gotten T-boned at an intersection and was talking to the Police Officer when I called!
<user1> Oh no! Is she okay?! Don't beat yourself up too much, you couldn't have ever imagined that she had been in an accident.
<user1> What happened?
<user0> Well, I ended up having way too much to drink. One of her co-workers had a bottle of Fireball (gross I KNOW) and was making everybody do shots. I didn't want to look foolish, so I had... well too many.
<user1> I love Fireball.
<user1> No, what happened?
<user0> Well first of all, it wasn't just any concert - it was Jay-Z and Beyonce! AND IT GOT RAINED OUT! 
<user1> Thats horrible. Will they reschedule?
<user1> Who, tell me!
<user0> My friend Benny! The one we all thought died in a monsoon in Thailand!
<user1> Wow, what happened?
<user1> That is very nice gift. Did you bought anything for him for Father's day?
<user0> I did! I also gave him unexpected gifts and he was super happy. I was very touched by him being so thoughtful!
<user1> That is great.
<user1> Oh what job was the interview for?
<user0> This advertising company! The owner was there - you should have seen his face. My last freelance project was a real winner. Think I got it?
<user1> I think you got it man! Congratz!
<user1> oh my  are you really serious?
<user0> As a heart attack. It was me and Big C at the World's Largest Pistachio. All of the sudden we hear gunshots, and DiDi's still in the car. We ran in the building, and he comes flying in after us. He never pointed the gun at us, and we ended up running away when he was distracted. It's too crazy - I can't make this up. Just glad to be alive!
<user1> I am very glad it has a happy ending. Sounds a bit scary
<user1> Oh no, what did you do?
<user0> I quietly pushed him away, as I didn't want my friend to hear. I was so shocked and upset, since he knew I wouldn't want to make a scene and took advantage.
<user1> Did you ever tell your friend?  
<user1> Oh no, I hate when that happens. I can sympathize with you because thats happen to me twice! Its okay in the winter time and you can sort of keep your food fresh but not during the summer
<user0> Yes, and of course we tried to call and have someone come out, but to no avail! You don't realize how much you rely on things like that until they aren't working!
<user1> I wish refrigerators would have a warranty that replaced food when they went bad. 
<user1> Wao, you must fell weird about it! what you thinki to do about it?
<user0> I felt bad, but she wasn't working and taking care of her grandchild, and her boyfriend was the financial support. I knew it would really be hard on her if she found out, not to mention she really loves him.
<user1> SUper tough situation, i think you should let her know, and let her decides next
<user1> Oh, I'm sure you were embarrassed! But, maybe you can laugh about it now?
<user0> Yes, totally but at the moment i felt like the stupidiest person on earth, didn't know were to hide! and my mom was watching
<user1> Well, I'm sure mom had a laugh lol! I can imagine how you felt at the time though!
<user0> THe good thing about it, was the lady, she was laughing and later told me that it has happened to her childrens to, no worries!
<user0> Ah, that sounds fantastic! Which ocean will you be enjoying?
<user1> Well, we are staying at Panama City Beach, so we're right there at the Gulf of Mexico.
<user0> Sounds awesome! Do you have a beachside beverage or traditions that you enjoy? (Mine would be tequila + lime...very Jimmy Buffett ;-))
<user0> Well, that's impressive! I can see why you are proud. Sounds like a hard working young lady!
<user1> That, and she's enjoying the independence of having her own money. Remember that? Making money that you truly could use for your *pleasure* (and not just necessities ?! ;-))
<user0> Yes, I was the same way too! I started working two days after I turned 16 so I could have my own money too!
<user1> Same! I was surprised 15 year olds *can* actually work during the summer. It's just finding an employer who knows those hours get cut WAY back once school starts.
<user1> Absolutely I agree I always try to not even bring cart unless I have too many too carry.
<user0> Me too. And I will always make sure to at *least* put it in one of those cart corrals, if not walk it back up to the store. Hey -- extra exercise ;-)
<user1> Yes me too Now if everyone would just take our lead lol
<user0> WE CAN SAVE THE WOOOOOOORLD!!!!! (lol indeed....!)
<user0> oh wow. Do you know whether it will be a boy or girl yet?
<user1> We choose to wait! but the amount of happiness in my body is tremendous! never felt this way before.
<user0> First time parent?
<user1> Yes, God willing the baby is going to be healthy in every way! can wait to ave the second
<user1> What kind of work do you do?
<user0> I work with different organizations on strengthening their culture, and I do large-scale visual notetaking (also known as graphic recording). Are you familiar with that at all? (Not unusual NOT to be!)
<user1> Actually I'm not, but it sounds very interesting and by working with different organizations, I would imagine it's also exciting and new every day.
<user0> That's one of the huge benefits -- learning about many different industries and subjects!
<user0> I agree, its always nice to have people around you who are smarter in some areas
<user1> It's just too many leaders want "yes men" and/or people who feel non-threatening. It's a trap and a quick path to mediocrity, if not failure!
<user0> Yes men are definitely a bad idea when it comes to life and business
<user0> Baby belugas are cute, but not as cute as your baby!
<user1> Ha! True that ;-) That's also the year that A Bug's Life came out, and we always thought of our young one as "Dot", the spunky little girl ant in the movie.
<user0> That is so funny! I don't think she'll want to be compared to an ant when she gets older. You'll have to remind her.
<user0> That is great!!  Sometimes we mom's get a bit forgotten, so to have an entire day where we are just loved is such a great feeling.
<user1> Yes, definitely! I actually cried a few times because of how much thought went into each gift and what was written in the cards 
<user0> Those words are the things we cherish more than any other thing, I love it when my girls do that!
<user0> I am not sure, it was pretty random
<user1> Did they give you any feedback?
<user0> No, nothing at all
<user1> That is a shame, you need to learn from your mistakes.
<user0> I know
<user0> That is exciting news!  I bet you were so surprised!
<user1> I was very surprised. She didn't tell a single person they were trying for a baby. Just announced it on the 4th of July
<user0> Ha!  What a neat day to announce it - did they do any special kind of announcement?  I see so many videos of interesting and neat ways to make that announcement.
<user1> Yes, they put a picture of their sonogram on the tv and waited for someone to notice it. So exciting
<user1> I do watch Netflix sometimes.  Do you watch?
<user0> Yes, I do. I recently watched the series "Dark." It's the German one.
<user1> I haven't heard of that one.  What genre does it fall in?
<user0> It's a supernatural mystery type. I won't spoil the twist.
<user1> Sounds interesting!
<user0> It was fantastic, a lot of people have been comparing it to Stranger Things, but its a lot more grime and serious.
<user0> Did it go your way?
<user1> Yes, I actually ended up winning it and they gave me 6 months of unemployment pay.
<user0> That is great - have you found another job yet?
<user1>  Yes I am currently working as a processing assistant at a warehouse. I love it. Much better than my last job
<user1> I hate traffic too, it makes me angry
<user0> Yes! People were constantly cutting me off,not signalling and slamming on their brakes
<user1> People are so rude when they drive these days
<user1> I can imagine! That was a terrifying movie.
<user0> And yet I still felt as if I had to see the sequels when they came out too.
<user1> That happened to me too.. with the other Exorcist movies and the Ring movies. Even though they scared me, I was too curious to not see the others.
<user1> She sounds like a person with great ability. Great choice of friend.
<user0> She has been my friend for 19 years. She pushes me to do better too.
<user1> That's great. I wish I had someone so close like that!
<user0> I hope you find someone like that. I believe everyone needs and deserves friends like that.
<user0> Is that a bad sign? Perhaps the plant is not getting enough nutrition or sunlight?
<user1> I don't think that's the problem. I am worried about a drainage issue. I'm going to check back in a couple days.
<user0> Oh, I see. I am not much of a horticulturist but it makes sense that it could be over-saturated.
<user1> I'm new to growing bananas and from what I understand they can be very sensitive to over-watering. It was doing great before today. Possibly wind too. 
<user1> Put what word ? You mean published the info?
<user0> Basically, yes. I made a classified ad. I was beyond thrilled after getting a call to get one!
<user1> So what breed did you get ?
<user1> I would be too! You did what you had to do!
<user0> Yes, I am always better off with them as my parents, they want to see us succeed
<user1> Do you find the home buying experience worth it?
<user0> Yes, it was well worth it! I love being independant. teaches you a lot.
<user1> How long do you plan on staying in that house?
<user0> Maybe 5 more years then I am ready for something bigger. Probably when I get married
<user1> Well that's awesome! I'm happy for you!
<user1> You shouldn't, because that is  a very stressful job
<user0> Yeah, that's a good point. I also realized he has a high malpractice insurance, and is on call a lot.
<user1> And don't forget how many years they have to study in order to get a license for surgery
<user0> True. He went to college for 12 years! The student loans are probably high too.
<user0> Really? Do you know what you want to do when you graduate? I know sometimes it's tough to settle on a path.
<user1> I want to be one to run the office part of a physicians practice but that isn't set in stone. I am thrilled to start my new career path
<user0> That sounds like a great career plan. You will be filling a very important role in the physician's practice!
<user0> I'm not sure. What would you do?
<user1> You could chat to them and complain!
<user0> Maybe I will try that. Do you think it will work?
<user1> Who knows, I guess it depends on how reasonable they are. 
<user1> Oh no, that sounds like an awful situation. What did you end up doing after that?
<user0> I stayed with her for about a year until I got my own apartment. We are getting an apartment together in a few months.
<user1> So exciting! It can be fun to have a roommate
<user0> She also has 2 daughters, 2 and 7, and a few crested geckos too so I'll have a bunch of roommates.
<user1> I love that. Lots of new friends, haha
<user0> I've known them since the moment they were born, but it will still be a blast.
<user0> I've heard a lot of people say something similar. Did you go there a lot?
<user1> I did! I was talking to my husband about the different toys I had. Even started talking about the music and shows from that era
<user0> Where I grew up didn't have one nearby so I get a little jealous hearing about it.
<user0> Good lord you must have had Facebook for a LONG time! I started mine in college so there isn't anything from my younger years.
<user1> Oh no, it was just a post someone shared that covered all the old trends, food, toys, tv shows, etc. I had Facebook back in 2010 but not earlier than that.
<user0> Oh ok lol. I completely understand. I had a friend share a post about making mix tapes from the radio with a cassette player. Totally remember doing that!
<user1> How old are you? Were you a child in the 80s? I am 30 so I grew up during the 90s.
<user0> I am 33 :)
<user1> Oh so only a few years older than me. I love the feeling of nostalgia though. I pretty much live for it.
<user1> Me too, bullies are part of the reason that I homeschooled.
<user0> Good for you! Did you find other ways to interact with kids on better terms?
<user1> Well, I was referring to my own kids. They have adjusted well at 17 and 19.
<user1> I also saw it and felt like it was pretty good. Much better than the My Little Pony Movie. That was TORTURE.
<user0> Oh I can't imagine. I don't think I would pay more than a quarter to see that movie.
<user1> Yeah it was so boring. Even my kids got bored and they had been dying to see it,
<user1> That's not nice of them. Why do they keep taking it??
<user0> They need it for other stuff. I never get a chance to save any of it.
<user1> Sorry to hear that. I found that it helps to have multiple savings accounts, so whenever you get a certain amount of money (like $5, $10) save it and be strict not to spend it.
<user1> LOL! This is perfect timing because I had the " You are an adult not a child" conversation with my girlfriend not too long ago. I had left popsicle wrapper on the night stand and it got sticky. I argued if you are willing to date someone who likes to eat Popsicles in bed, then you have to deal with the consequences. 
<user0> LOL! Okay, y'all are a sitcom. I have to ask what flavor. (And yes, I side with your girlfriend. If for no other reason: ANTS. You do NOT want ants marching into your bed toward any potentially sensitive regions. Okuuurrrrrr?)
<user1> Okay, it wasn't just one, it was three: One cherry, and two grape. How anyone can eat just one at a time? Oh, the number of wrappers was also brought up. Like, I don't care if yuo bought them for the kids, I am part of this household as well. I tried to make it a teaching moment about how if you don't get the popsicles first someone else would, but I think my arguments have been falling on deaf ears for awhile now, lol
<user1> Wow. I'm so sorry to hear that. That would be incredibly hard. What happened?
<user0> She fell off of a roof. She fell asleep and when she got up, she slipped.
<user1> That's horrible. I'm really sorry about your friend. 
<user0> It has been a long time so I have come to cope with it, but sometimes it's still hard. I named my daughter after her. Her name is Roxie.
<user1> That's a beautiful name! It's cool you honored your friend in that way. 
<user0> It really helped me heal when I was able to do that.
<user1> I can't even imagine. I've never lost anyone super close to me yet...
<user1> Did you not have a car? That's hard. I don't have one now and use Uber and Lyft all the time.
<user0> We had one car we shared but I had a little girl and we were just stuck at the house or got rides. We didn't really have uber and Lydt yet. But someone gave me a car out of the blue!
<user1> That is incredible! I swear some things in life are determined by fate. I'm glad you were able to get a car.
<user0> Thanks me too. It blew me away that people can be so kind. 
<user1> It's incredible, and so important. That's why I try to pass on the kindness whenever I am able.
<user1> Yes.My first was when i turned 18.
<user0> That's awesome! What a good year to do it. I remember begging my husband to throw me one every year. 
<user1> LOL.You had to beg your husband for a surprise party??
<user0> Haha! Yes! And what's really funny, is that I almost missed it because I wasn't actually expecting it and almost didn't get back in time! Whoops. 
<user0> Did you have candles or a flash light to help yous see?
<user1> Only lighters. Now we are stocked on candles 
<user0> Well atleast you have something to help you guys.
<user0> How did you do
<user1> I ended up actually getting a 98%!
<user0> That is great! My B.S. ( I always hate saying that because I have to say I have my BS in psychology) is in Psychology.
<user1> Haha I always thought that was a funny term too. That's amazing. Psychology is absolutely fascinating.
<user1> Pet? Like dogs and other?
<user0> Yes. We got a cat not too long  ago and he drives me crazy! He's such a night owl and is always banging into stuff. 
<user1> Wow, seriously I hate those pets being around me
<user1> From where?
<user0> Highschool.
<user1> Congrats ,that's a step forward
<user1> I am so sorry. I can't imagine what you must have went through.
<user0> I felt like I had no one. The two people I loved most in life I barely saw and was disconnected from.
<user1> That must have been really hard. 
<user0> It was, but I grew so much from it, and it ended up being the very best thing that could have happened to me.
<user0> Really?  What kind of work does he do?
<user1> He owns his own coffee shop. He started roasting when he was 16 and now he's only 26 but distributes beans across the country.
<user0> Wow.. that is impressive.  Are you guys still friends?  Maybe he could get you a job in one of his stores.
<user0> Awww... reminds me of the show hoarders when the family members argue over silly things like that.  What was the necklace all about did you make it or something?
<user1> I feel like her and my aunt kind of could be on that show. :/ I'm all about less stuff to pick up! lol Eh..it was a necklace she gave me when they found out they were pregnant. It said "Special Sister". I'm probably a jerk..
<user0> Well why did you have it if it belonged to them?  Did you pawn it?
<user1> No, they bought it for me. I think I was going goodwill it and she grabbed it back. lol She said she wants to pass it onto my daughter someday so that's sweet.
<user0> Thats sweet of them. Maybe you could make it up to her buy getting her a special mom necklace with your spare cash.
<user0> All the time.  That is part of listening to music I suppose.  The songs remind you of when you first heard them.
<user1> Yeah, I guess that's fair. It happens all the time to me too. Sometimes makes me wish I was reliving those moments but I don't think I would really want to go back..
<user0> I know what you mean.  However, the older I get the more I want to go back LOL.
<user1> lol :) That's true. Life is hard and did seem so much more carefree when I was younger, but I just don't like who I was. I like me now much better :)
<user1> Oh no!  What happened to it?
<user0> It was the first time he had gotten outside and he didn't come back that night. He was hit by a car. :(
<user1> So sad!  I am sorry.  Don't feel too bad its natural for them to want to be outside.
<user0> Thank you. I appreciate that. 
<user0> it is so sad to know but my mother is rather sick of flu and not dying 
<user1> The flu sure makes it feel like you're dying haha
<user0> Oh yes but it is not as bad and you cannot call it dying like in Cancer patient 
<user1> Agreed, definitely not. I actually work in radiation oncology and see cancer every day at work.
<user1> Did you get sick afterwards 
<user0> Extremely, but it passed after a day or so. Never consume raw shellfish, unless sushi because they properly prepare it
<user1> i do not think sushi is that good too. The best option is to stop eating them in any form of food
<user0> You don't care for sushi that much?
<user0> Damn that sounds like a pretty good one! How did that turn out?
<user1> I ended up being very upset at first and then laughed it off!
<user0> That's how all pranks should be!
<user0> I am so sorry to hear that. Is there any chance you might be able to reconcile???
<user1> I don't think so. He wants to join the military since his dad has passed away and I'm not sure if that's the lifestyle I want.
<user0> Oh that's too bad. ): I don't want to overstep but I always like to encourage people to hold on to their love for each other no matter what trials come up. 
<user1> I think we're going to try long distance while I finish up school (3 more years). But it's just scary thinking of it all.
<user0> I think that's good! If you are meant to be together you'll feel it and it will work out I think, if you just keep your conviction and stick with it. Good luck with it! 
<user1> We have dogs and chameleons together, so it's like we're already a little family haha
<user0> Aw, that's sweet! I really am hoping y'all make it through this together. (:
<user0> So sad,you can never force someone to love you. You will find the right person for you.
<user1> I hope so. Maybe one day, but I am not so sure.
<user0> Don't give up on love.It the best feeling ever to experience. Wish you well.
<user0> Do you have a good chance with her. Have you talked to her about it?
<user1> I think she has expressed interest in me in the past, but she recently moved, but she is not too far away. I might ask her on a date the next time I am around.
<user0> That will be better. Talk to her before you lose her
<user0> Probably one where I got a limo with all my friends and went to this restaurant, it was great. What about yours, what makes your friends so great too?
<user1> Wow, I am impressed! My friends just show me love and buy me tequila aha!
<user0> I wish my friends bought me alcohol, that would make for a hell of a night! 
<user1> For sure, maybe you need new friends!
<user1> hi are you there?
<user0> I recently had an argument with my sister. It made us both very annoyed.
<user1> That must be hard I always wished I had a sister though I have a brother 
<user1> Oh my! You must have been terrified! Did everything turn out ok?
<user0> Everything turned out fine. I think somebody in the nearby neighborhoods may have been hurt, though.
<user1> That is not good at all. That is a very scary situation.
<user1> I have not tried yet, but i feel like it would be enjoying and full of delight
<user0> Next time you get a cold front in your area you should try it. It's extremely relaxing and sleep-inducing haha
<user1> I live in a place where it only snows once in 10 years. So, i think i am passing on that
<user0> I live in Louisiana, so it's very rare that I get to enjoy it. I've had it maybe three or four times in my lifetime. It just left a lasting impression.
<user0> You are so lucky. Mums are the best. What do you do for her?
<user1> I tell her I love her and also send her gifts from time to time. She doesn't live too close to me but I try.
<user0> You should spend time with her whilst you can. My mum died and I wish I had been with her more.
<user0> Nothing went wrong, we just have different lives in different places. I go visit every now and then.
<user1> But you failed the exam? Did you revise?
<user0> I did not revise. Sometimes exams are failed and things are not corrected.
<user1> At least you know for next time eh?
<user1> That is great that you have an awesome Mom!
<user0> She's amazing. Do you love your mom?
<user1> Yes I do love my mom very much.
<user1> ooh, am so sorry about that. Have you tried to talk to her?
<user0> It's tough because she has been out of the country for a month, so I will likely discuss it when she returns.
<user1> that will help you know her stand on your relationship
<user1> well i am a mover so i have to bring heavy furniture up and down stairs.
<user0> That sounds like hard work. I hope you are paid well.
<user1> it pays decent and feeds the kids so I can't complain.
<user0> Fair enough. As long as you look after your back"
<user0> That's awesome. What are you majoring in?
<user1> Environmental engineering! I enjoy it, but I wouldn't say it is my passion in life.
<user0> Sometimes it's good to have something you enjoy make money so you can pursue your passion without worrying about it.
<user0> That is such a bummer. Why did you keep watching them?
<user1> I honestly don't know. I've always been fascinated with them since being a little girl and that fascination has never gone away.
<user0> I understand being fascinated by them they can be very intriguing. Maybe you should stop watching as many though. 
<user1> I've been telling myself that for years, I just have no self control. What are your favorite kinds of movies?
<user0> I like scary movies as well so I know how addicting they can be.
<user1> What is your favorite scary movie at the moment?
<user0> It is actually "Scream." 
<user0> Oh yeah, Donald Trump is such a charlatan. He has some really shady history too. I'm actually a Christian and a conservative but I'm appalled that everyone on the "right" have fallen for this guy. He's so against what the real conservative values are supposed to be.
<user1> I agree. I am glad real conservatives are in opposition to him, too.
<user0> Yeah, I am sad about the whole left vs. right thing in general. Ultimately we should all be uniting against the corrupt people that are running amok in the government. 
<user0> awwww. congratulations. what is your major
<user1> Environmental Engineering is my major. I enjoy it.
<user0> lovely. thats really great. wishing you all the best
<user0> That is interesting, how does he buy you stuff or is he just really nice?
<user1> He is really nice and provides for me well. He is also very sweet and very respectful.
<user0> I am happy for you wish I could find a nice lover like that.
<user0> Yes, I think they offer a great bridge to the past. Do you?
<user1> Absolutely. I love to hear my mámá tell me stories from her childhood trapping nutria and trawling with her family.
<user0> That's great. It sounds like a very good situation to be in.
<user1> I also love to look through the old scrapbooks my mom made when I was a baby and young child. I find it's so funny to see what you looked like as a child.
<user1> :( I'm very sorry. Have you tried telling her how you feel? That could affect her decision.
<user0> I have not told her as much as I need to. I am trying to build the courage.
<user1> I know it's hard to build the confidence needed to do something like that, but you don't want to keep them to yourself. If you really think she is the woman of your dreams then you have to try
<user1> I'm not quite following. Anything you want to tell me about?
<user0> About what exactly?
<user1> Well did you have any story or anything that you had in mind that you wanted to tell me? I told you a story of mine before so you owe me haha.
<user0> Now that is an interesting perspective!
<user0> That is really nice of her.  It is nice to have someone to help you do things sometimes.
<user1> Nice people are the best. Empathy is something we all need more of!
<user0> Yes.  Too many people these days are mean to one another!
<user0> That's so sad, I hope you've gotten over it.
<user1> It is tough, but I think I will make it.
<user0> That's good, death is a natural part of life.
<user0> No,u don't have to be 
<user1> It makes me feel inferior. Hopefully I will get over it.
<user0> Yes,u will surely get over it
<user0> That is very special and I am so happy for you.
<user1> I am very happy, too. Do you have someone special in your life?
<user0> Yes, married for 15 years and it is still great.
<user0> That's good to have a loving family.
<user1> I agree. I hope you are also close to your family!
<user0> I am i love them very much. However we live on opposite parts of the country.
<user0> Wow, 7 years? You were really young then
<user1> Yes
<user0> But did you tell your friend about it later?
<user0> Oh no! That must have been super embarrassing! How did you react to that?
<user1> I covered my body and then went to the bathroom and got a towel!
<user0> My goodness, well I guess that happens to all of us at least once.
<user0> That sounds fun, starting a new life is always great!
<user1> I agree. I am thinking about moving to the West Coast of the USA.
<user0> West Coast is fun, but it can be expensive.
<user0> Because she was what?
<user1> sorry lol. because she was "late". but she told me the result was negative, not pregnant. so then we went to a furniture store just to browse
<user0> I think that is a good news for you both since you are not married
<user1> well here's the thing. We are married. Been together 5 years. So as I'm walking around looking at stuff in this store, I notice a bookmark hanging off the ear of a wooden rocking horse!
<user1> I can imagine the loneliness someone can experience.
<user0> My whole family is out the house for a few months. I'm going to be so bored with no one around...
<user1> Get your self a friend to stay with for a couple of months.
<user1> Wow, please make it real.
<user0> There's only 2 other people in the final round! Winning a PS4 will be awesome!
<user1> Wow, I belief u can make it.
<user1> Who is supplying these snacks? 
<user0> Well, my wife gets them on deals, so likes to hoard them in the cupboard. 
<user1> Sounds like a cupboad cleaning is necessary. If they ain't around, they can't be eaten.
<user1> why did she go visiting?
<user0> because she hasn't seen them in almost 2 years. Misses them
<user1> really? so she would have travelled with him
<user1> That sounds horrible. You must've been mad.
<user0> I was! I had to travel all the way home with a huge mess on me!
<user1> Where was this?
<user0> Paddington Train Station.
<user0> Well,it can happen like that atimes
<user1> Have you ever missed out on a promotion?
<user0> Yes,it really hurts
<user0> am sorry to hear that. what happened to the mother
<user1> Unfortunately she passed away, hence the funeral.
<user0> soryy, may she rest in peace, please try comfort your wife
<user0> Damn, very confident huh? What job did you apply for?
<user1> CEO of Apple. I figured they need a Steve 2.0 to take them forward! 
<user0> Oh wow, that outta pay very well.
<user0> Oh boy that is the worst, so frustrating! Has there been any change since?
<user1> plenty lol. kicked them out long time ago. now with new wife of 5 years haha. but point is, i never cheated even during those 8 months of feeling alone, heck, BEING alone
<user0> Hahaha you put the hammer down good for you bro. How are things with the new wife going?
<user1> as bill & ted would say: Excellent! {guitar}
<user0> You remember that show hahaha totally my twin. I'm glad for you bro. Good luck to you!
<user0> Oh my god! How old is he?
<user1> He's only 13! I didn't even think he had that in him!
<user0> You really need to let him know not to do that again, he could've really gotten himself and others hurt!
<user0> Really? What makes them A list?
<user1> He's dating Kylie Jenner. Have you heard of her?
<user0> Yeah I have lol. What's your brothers name?
<user1> Justin Beiber.
<user1> Not being able to fit into an old wedding dress, is one of a womans worst nightmare.
<user0> Oh wow, I can imagine. How old was it?
<user1> The dress was a few years old, I couldnt believe it didnt fit.
<user0> That's rough, but I'm sure you can get past that.
<user0> I like Starbucks. But they're a little expensive for me to go there often.
<user1> They definitely are expensive. What's your favourite drink to get?
<user0> A latte.
<user0> Wao,thats great,congrats!
<user1> Thank you! Looks like there's going to be another Doctor in the family!
<user0> Thats good to know,keep it up
<user0> Wow, that will be so devastating for you
<user1> The pizza was from my favourite pizza shop as well! Quite the sad moment.
<user0> So, how did you now do it
<user1> I was getting keys out of my pocket, and then WHAM, right on the floor. The pineapple slices were the first to fall on the floor.
<user1> Report to their management
<user0> Sometimes I think the management don't even care!
<user1> Just give it a trial
<user1> Haha, how did she feel when she found out?
<user0> She made me pay twice what they would have sold for at the bake sale. The cookies were for charity, you see.
<user1> Oh no! Those cookies sure do sound delicious though.
<user1> Dang, I hated that. At least it's not cow poop, that's worst. 
<user0> That is true, cow poop is much worst! But I was wearing brand new Gucci flip flops! 
<user1> Oh man, you gotta super clean it, have the professionals do it even 
<user1> How do you make it?
<user0> You've got to cut up all the ingredients, and put it in small containers, before finally cooking all at once.
<user1> Good to know.  I will do it like it next time.
<user1> Congrats! What gender did your child end up being?
<user0> thanks. no mistake about it, it's a boy! lol. Takes after his father ;)
<user1> That's great my man! I can't wait for my first son. So far 6 daughters :(
<user0> Holy Moses!! don't quit trying :)
<user0> don't panic, and don't be harsh on the kid. perhaps spend time going over the subject together? or maybe he's having other trouble that's affecting his studies
<user1> He spent all his time playing football instead of studying! I warned him about this!
<user0> it's better to do what you're passionate about. do that and success follows
<user0> That's cool.  For what class
<user1> It was a test in Numeracy, so counting 1 - 100. I've always found that difficult, but god made it possible!
<user0> God works in mysterious ways
<user0> wow. I would be too. I love guitar, it's my favorite musical instrument. I wonder if he was born blind
<user1> Yea. I think he was. His story was crazy too. He is an orphan 
<user0> just goes to show that people can be amazing. Just never give up, persistence is the key
<user0> oh no! that sounds annoying. Did you end up getting help?
<user1> had to hitch hike. made it on time for check in though. now the cars been in the shop 4 days, no progress. kinda getting worried about it
<user0> that sounds terrible! I hope everything gets sorted! Be positive 
<user0> Thats amazing, congratulations. 12 Kids your amazing.
<user1> It's easier if you had 12 different baby mamas, that's my trick anyway. This last labour was 6 hours long!
<user0> Haha, your a player.
<user0> That's creepy. What do you think they were, hyenas? 
<user1> No, the spooky thing is... I think it's the ghost of Michael Jackson. I even saw him dancing to Billie Jean.
<user0> Must have been quite a sight. 
<user0> Oh,will u be going to pay him a visit?
<user1> I can't visit him. I've had to flee the country. We were robbing banks together, and he got caught with half the cash. I'm currently in the Bahamas.
<user0> Hope u will not indulge in such act like theft again?
<user0> Wow, that is a great news
<user1> He's just joined Juventus. Can't be more happy for the lad.
<user0> Wow, that is a really good club
<user0> Is this your first son?
<user1> yes it is. I am very happy
<user0> Awesome! Any daughters? What will be your sons name?
<user1> only child for now. name is RAIDEN (god of thunder) :D
<user1> holy Moses! I hate them things. Flying rats is what they are.
<user0> I know! This one was absolutely huge, almost human sized. Chased me for a whole hour. The more I think about it, it might have been the batman! I shouldn't have stolen those diamonds!
<user1> lol. don't do the crime if can't face the Bat ;)
<user1> Praise God man! He really is amazing and we should always be grateful for we have 
<user0> especially since he takes care of us even though don't deserve it
<user1> amen! so true. Its especially awesome when He picks us up in every fall. His love never fails
<user1> for real? that must've been embarrassing. Sorry to hear about that
<user0> yea! it was! I thought everyone would be annoyed at me but the next day when I went back to school, everyone just made it a joke so its alright. This was about 5-6 years ago now haha
<user1> well that's good and bad. hopefully the joke didn't carry on too long
<user1> I love me some Tupac. Real talk.
<user0> I started out with one hit wonders but ended up at Pac. I miss my youth lol
<user1> Me too. I always end up on the 90s hip hop station on Pandora.
<user1> Sorry to hear that. Did someone do anything against the company selling the food?
<user0> No, they just had a recall. Apparently they didn't clean out their machines properly when making the food, so it got contaminated. 
<user1> Someone should have sued them.
<user1> Oh yes, at least, you will be in a position to help them in return
<user0> absolutely! Always give to people who have less than myself :) 
<user1> That is good. You have a good heart
<user1> You must feel awful,  Why don't you come clean, maybe you will feel better.
<user0> no way. I just pray she can forgive me. I could never admit to this sin. Jesus save me
<user1> Yes Jesus can save you if you ask him.  He always forgive.
<user1> He deserved that, I think.
<user0> Yeah, I was pretty amazed in the moment, he was flat as a board in mid air before he landed flat on his face. I had to watch for a moment in awe, before I realized he was getting up and I was about to get smacked. So, I ran towards where the parents were seated, stopped when I turned the corner, and walked calmly over to my mom, taking a seat on her lap. I looked innocent as could be as the mean kid came around the corner, and I forced myself to sit still so that when he smacked me in the face with the hoola hoop, I looked like a helpless victim.
<user1> Wow, interesting.
<user1> Wow, you must have felt jealous
<user0> jealous isn't the one I felt. I wanted to rip her apart lol
<user1> Hahahaa, its not easy though, I would have done same
<user1> When you have responsibilities that you really care about, you do what you have to. I commend him. ITs hard raising a family,
<user0> Yeah, especially because we were single income. My mom homeschooled my brother and I. I think he took only a handful of sick days his entire time working, had something like 600 days saved up when he retired.
<user1> Oh wow. Ive never heard of that many sick days.
<user0> I think he got 3 weeks a year, only used like 5 days.
<user1> cool.
<user1> So, what was she lying to you about?
<user0> she arranged to meet up with her ex to return his t-shirt! why do that behind my back? we had just started seeing each other. Made me so mad
<user1> Oh, she shouldn't have done that
<user1> Oh no how horrible
<user0> ye and so I had to leave the country because of her
<user1> oh no
<user1> I hate public schools ooo
<user0> yes. Well it was a long time ago but I haven't forgotten
<user1> But it's really cool atimes
<user1> Thats cool, I did online school in high school
<user0> Really? I didn't even know that was an option. Then again I'm 25 so it may not have been available then.
<user1> Well were pretty close in age
<user1> I remember him, he was going to be a great actor.
<user0> Now the remake is well on its way. Maybe it can lift this depression I feel if they stay true to the story. Jason Mamoa isn't bad looking
<user1> Yeah he might do a pretty good job as that character.
<user1> Adapting to life is always good to do.
<user0> I am reminded every day that I can survive anything. A friend gave me a special bracelet (paracord)
<user1> Thats a great attitude to have. You should keep with that.
<user1> How awful! how do you feel about it?
<user0> Very angry and frustrated that she would behave that way. It makes me think less of her as a person.
<user1> Yes I understand, it is really sad when you find that people you have known a long time can be very different from what you thought.
<user1> Lols why didn't you do anything 
<user0> I wasn't confident. Now I regret not punishing him. 
<user1> Awww but it's still good that you didn't push him, Cox it might lead to something else 
<user1> Oh My Goodness! How wonderful!!!! That is so awesome! Congratulations. 
<user0> Thanks! It was a huge challenge, and I'm SO glad to have it behind me! 
<user1> Wow! I better! I Stopped at Associates of General Studies, because I wanted to be a mom more. So that is a HUGE step for you! 
<user0> Being a mom is great, too! And you never know- maybe you'll go back to school in the future! Thanks! 
<user1> This is TRUE! I am glad to be at home with these guys right now. Have a great day! 
<user1> Congratulations! I hope to get a house next year
<user0> It took me 9 months of determination and sacrifice. But worth it.
<user1> I bet! Hard work pays off
<user1> Things happen that are bad, I am sure it wasnt your fault.
<user0> I was distracted by the sound of running water.
<user1> I am sure they forgave you in the end.
<user1> Music always seems to be better from the past, I understand all too well.
<user0> Its true though, they can't make good music these days. Not in ANY genre.
<user1> I totally agree, new music is not as good.
<user1> I get paid today as well! What game are you thinking about getting?
<user0> I'm thinking about getting FarCry 5. I pre-order for the early release! I'm really excited about it.
<user1> Didn't that game come out a few months ago? I got it shortly after I released and I wasn't very impressed. It wasn't a bad game, but it certainly was not the best game.
<user1> Congratulations. That sounds like the fast track.
<user0> yes, They thought that I have some extraordinary talent and that is the reason I got that position
<user1> Cool. Maybe next year you will be a partner!
<user0> Maybe yes, Haha, Now I am looking for a Manager post and then become a senior manager
<user1> I hope you get it
<user1> I am so sorry to hear that! Is there a particular section you are having trouble with?
<user0> Yes, I am a little uncomfortable driving backwards. I just can't do that.
<user1> Ah! That's quite understandable. It is tricky at first and non-intuitive. I practiced driving in reverse with cones in an abandoned lot. 
<user0> every time I try not to hit that cone but those are so close.
<user1> I know it's hard, but practice makes perfect! Keep trying and I am sure you will get it!
<user1> Why what is the matter?
<user0> Well, for many years I was an alcoholic, working for near minimum wage in kitchens. But that all changed when I was accepted to University!
<user1> Hmmm! That is just annoying being an alcoholic. I purely understand your situation as I have gone through it. Well! life goes on.
<user0> It does. I worked really hard to pass the acceptance tests, and I couldn't believe when I passed with flying colors!
<user1> that is great..congrats....
<user1> Thats creepy honestly
<user0> It was just very creepy situation
<user1> Yeah whispering in someones ear is weird
<user0> lol thats funny
<user0> Nice! What job is going for
<user1> armed security
<user0> Cool.  Hope he gets it, I hear they pay pretty well
<user0> Just you. No security?
<user1> no, I was on a 10th floor and security was down. I was scared even with a single noise.
<user0> I would be too. 
<user0> That's nice, how long did it take you ?
<user1> it took 4 years but at last got it
<user0> Fantastic, now do you have a job lined up?
<user1> Yeah,  I have  a job that I was looking for and now I am really enjoying my life.
<user1> I've been in a fender bender not a total wreck.
<user0> I was in one about 2 years ago. No one was hurt, but it totaled both of our cars.
<user1> Man, how was your insurance policy for that?
<user1> Yes, Several times in my life. Mostly me and my older brother when we were younger.
<user0> I got in a fist fight with my step father once. It wasn't a fun experience as you can imagine.
<user1> What started the fist fight in the first place?
<user1> I haven't heard of it
<user0> It came out in 1999. I used to play it when i was a teen. I installed it the other day and had a good time playing.
<user1> Everything old makes a come back!
<user1> One of my favorite places to eat. I love the swirled ice cream cones.
<user0> I like it too, but I'm not a big fan of their new sliders. They're so tiny, and just one of them cost almost 2 dollars!
<user1> Over priced food is no fun. I like dollar menus.
<user1> Yep! Not really that fun to have since you see things at times.
<user0> Yeah, in mine I saw a smoke looking shadow over me with red eyes staring at me. I've never been more scared in my life.
<user1> Man that is scary! Granted i like to hear things about that. 
<user1> Yes when I was young I did all the time, but I think after I turned 18 I got this weird fear of being so high up in the air. What about you?
<user0> I hate riding them, but i used to machine components for their drive chain when I was a machinist.
<user1> Wow thats really cool! You must be happy to know about that stuff its interesting!
<user1> What a creep. I hope that you told on him.
<user0> Yes, I let him know that was wrong and disgusting. I couldn't believe he did it!
<user1> Some people are like that. Did you tell your husband?
<user0> Yes, as I am honest with him. But, I didn't want trouble.
<user0> Where are you headed ?
<user1> Going to Kazakhstan. That's where i was born. My parents still live there and i miss them so much
<user0> Great, I hope you have a nice trip. How long will you be staying?
<user0> That's great! It was meant to happen then
<user1> Yes I agree, she was so happy when she found out the job was hers
<user0> I would have been too. I've never been fired. I always quit
<user1> She wasn't really fired, her position was no more. Schools don't have much room left for Home Ec teachers. Sad
<user0> I remember taking Home Ec. I loved that class
<user1> Yeah she has a passion for teaching. These kids will be great to work with.
<user1> Oh wow, puppies are nice.  What kind of puppy did you get?
<user0> Yes, so nice!! It was the best thing that could've happened! It's a German Shepherd! 
<user1> Thats a nice breed of dog.  I just went on a camping trip with a relative who has one, they are very loyal and smart of course.  Was he/she your first pet?
<user1> that's good! you should be proud of yourself
<user0> I was very proud definitely when I woke up the next morning and knew no mistakes were made!
<user1> that's great! i hate when people cheat
<user1> I can only imagine having to wait at the table alone, wondering if she'd show up. At least, it sounds like, she finally arrived.  Did she specify a reason for being so late?
<user0> Yes, she actually had a legit reason so I couldn't be too mad at her.. She definitely made it up to me!
<user1> That's good. I can somewhat relate. I think the longest I've waited on someone was a colleague who was supposed to meet us at happy hour, and ended up getting delayed by our boss for 45 minutes. We were glad she made it out, but I did feel worse for her than for all of us.
<user1> Ahhh! Me too, there is so much that can be done on the weekends!
<user0> i just want to sleep in and then watch movies all day long... but i'm a mom so i don't sleep in. ever
<user1> I understand that! I have a bunch of pet snakes that wake me up thru the night!
<user1> Actually that has happened to me, during Thanksgiving
<user0> Yes, when the snow builds up on the road I get nervous, and during this trip I couldn't even see where the road was and where the ditch began.
<user1> Im from NC mountains, it can be tricking driving when the snow is latying fast
<user0> It sure can.  When I decided that I wasn't comfortable driving in such deep snow I literally turned around and went home.
<user1> That is a smart idea. Sometimes I would have no choice, but to keep going, bacsue of having to drive to work.No matter what the weather is.
<user1> I understand your pain. My parents are also separated.
<user0> It does definitely get easier over time I suppose.. Now that I see my life I guess it was for the best.
<user1> It just makes you mature faster. Just look at it like blessing in disguise.
<user1> That sucks.   Did you end up coming up with an alternate plan?
<user0> Well, when looking outside you could see a clear patch in the distance... So we kinda just hoped for the best to wait it out.. We finally did get to go!
<user1> That's good to hear.  How was the beach?
<user1> That would take away from her time with you. Was it for you?
<user0> Yes, the party was for me! I was so shocked and had no clue it was coming.
<user1> That would be a really nice surprise then!
<user1> why'd you steal it 
<user0> Because I really liked it, and didn't think he'd care.
<user1> oh yea what kind of shirt was it 
<user1> What did you do to pass the time?
<user0> I mainly just played video games and watched tv.
<user1> I love video games.
<user1> That sucks, why didn't you find a new apartment?
<user0> Because here in my area in Florida, there isn't too many options for me.
<user1> Maybe you should leave Florida.
<user1> Oh thats nice, what was she able to get for you?
<user0> She got me a brand new laptop I had been wanting for gaming!
<user1> thats awesome of her to be able to get you something you really wanted
<user1> Omg, I have seen one of those!
<user0> It was seriously so scary, I almost pooped myself!
<user1> I believe that!
<user1> What did you do?
<user0> Well I get super jealous and angry of course.. But in the end it was just a work friend.. Oops!
<user1> Did she get mad at you?
<user1> haha that sucks! did you take him/her out to pee recently?
<user0> Not since lunch, so it's actually been about 4 hours.. I hate living on the top floor!
<user1> What did you have for lunch?
<user1> That is amazing, good work.
<user0> Yes, I am so proud of myself for finally accomplishing it!
<user1> How long did it take you?
<user1> Oh wow. Did she break up with you?
<user0> No.. I realized the mistake I made and took action so it never would happen again.
<user1> Don't sweat it man. There is plenty of fish in the sea anyways.
<user1> Nice, I wish I could do a wheelie!
<user0> I know! I do too.. I think I need to learn to ride a sports bike first.. Hehe oops!
<user1> Yeah, I tried skateboarding in my childhood but was too scared to break something, lol.
<user1> Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that. Did you ever figure out what happened?
<user0> He was very old, so I guess we were all expecting it.. He lived a good life!
<user1> Oh, well that's a somewhat happy ending I suppose.
<user1> Haha I'm sorry! My dog is chill now but he ate a hole in the wall when he was a puppy lol
<user0> Oh dang, I guess I can't complain too much then, that's brutal!
<user1> Yeah lol what breed is yours? Mine is a golden so he loves eating stuff. Now it's thankfully just actual food.
<user1> Yea, I am like that, too. Did you apologize?
<user0> Well yes when i shouted and i inmeaditelly apologize but i feel really bad
<user1> It happens. Like you said, we can't all be perfect.
<user1> Who did you do all those things with? Sounds like a wonderful day!
<user0> I had time that I did not share with the children and that was something that was pending in my soul
<user1> They must have been really happy.
<user0> Sometimes one gives priority to work
<user0> There are so many spectacular views on this planet
<user1> Exactly. Look at the beautiful scenery around you. Nature at its very best. I am surprised people don't notice
<user0> It's a shame that people are letting these marvels pass them by.
<user1> People are getting busy everyday with other stuff and they forget to breathe fresh air. Leads to s stressful life
<user1> That can really make you lose your faith in wanting to trust people
<user0> Well, it definitely makes you a little more realistic when you may be tempted to put someone on a pedestal. Not really fair to them *or* to yourself, is it?
<user1> No not really because we are all human and make mistakes.
<user1> Oh, wow! My son was terrified of tornadoes because of that darn movie, and we don't really even get tornadoes where we live! Did you ever live through a tornado?
<user0> That's the thing -- NO! I mean, there were some that were kind of close -- but NOTHING like what so many folks have to deal with. I just remember wanting a basement sooooo badly -- not something that's common where I grew up!
<user1> Aw, poor little thing! How did you overcome this? Or, are you still afraid of them?
<user0> My mom said the best thing once when I was babysitting and a tornado warning went off and I didn't want my own fear to affect the little boy I was with -- she was on the phone and just said "You have big plans for the future, right? Nothing is going to get in the way of that." For some reason, it worked a charm ;-)
<user1> Your mom sounds awesome!  Wow, what a cool thing to say!  
<user1> We get carried away with our emotions sometimes. Did you explain it to them?
<user0> Yes! THAT I feel good about! Making a point to use it as an opportunity to talk. I've definitely used it when it comes to the way others might act -- emphasizing that it's not about *them*, it's really about the person and where they're at.
<user1> I'm glad you're not too prideful to admit your mistakes to your kids and used it as a teaching opportunity.
<user0> I do look at that as a strength, in anyone. Being able to say "I'm sorry" and "I made a mistake."
<user0> That is pretty awesome, I know if I ever got the chance it would change my life as well.
<user1> I highly, highly recommend it. Not always easy -- culture shock *is* a thing! -- but such a great way to enhance one's perspective.
<user0> I understand that, as long as I could understand the language I think I would be great anywhere.
<user0> tell me more about this
<user1> my partner gave me a an i phone it is very memorable and pleasure to me
<user0> if its an older iphone i would treasure it 
<user1> yes but its a valuable gift to me 
<user0> everyone values things differently
<user1> yeah but this gift is definitely different for me
<user1> What does he do for work?
<user0> he is an armed guard
<user1> Oh wow, that is a dangerous job.
<user1> have you had it tested ?
<user0> yes, i even have glasses but because of astigmatism i don't see good at night even when i have glasses on
<user1> so you have like tunnel vision where ?
<user1> Yeah, that can be annoying especially in Walmart since so many people go there. It stresses you out when you don't need it to.
<user0> Yes! They cut in front, and bump into you. Plus being rude while they do it 
<user1> Yeah, everyone just seems miserable, so it kind of drags you down, too. But it's a necessary evil.
<user1> that is why I am scared to have kids, that sounds terrible
<user0> i love being a mother but sleep deprivation is so horrible
<user1> that seems to be the case, you win some you lose some I guess
<user1> Who would that be?
<user0> O I'm sorry, my niece and nephews, only seem in the summer. Do you get company during the summer?
<user1> I love seeing mine too. I know how happy that must make you feel. Mine are local.
<user1> thats good to hear.  my kids will returning to school soon as well.  I cant wait!
<user0> My oldest daughter has some learning disabilities so I'm really proud of how she is doing. They're both growing up so fast
<user1> thats cool
<user1> Every little accomplishment counts! What bills did you have to pay?
<user0> rent and electricity. we've been struggling financially so it's such a relieve to pay bills
<user1> Sorry to hear that. Well, at least this will be a weight off your shoulders.
<user1> wow, you're so determined! Did you pass your exam?
<user0> I did pass! It was a rough 3 months, but once I got there, I felt like I was ready.
<user1> yay! congrats! that's really awesome. you should be proud of yourself
<user1> That's really exciting! I would be so happy about that. 
<user0> i know! now i can spend the rest of the money on something cool 
<user1> That's what I would do too. Do you have something in mind? 
<user1> Forget him. Get yourself a real man.
<user0> no.. i love him. but he can be such a punk sometimes
<user1> If he really loved you, he would pay attention to your every need. Kick him to the curb.
<user1> Be positive. Don't deviate your mind while driving. Concentrate completely on driving. You can.
<user0> I tried to tell myself that, but my dad got into a really bad accident once, and it has scared me ever since.
<user1> Sorry to hear this. Hope you'll get out from this fear and become a good driver. 
<user1> Sounds cool.
<user0> Yea, i put them in a glass of water for a week or two and they grow their own roots, wasn't expecting much.
<user1> Do you cook a lot with tomatoes
<user0> I do yes! and since the method i used is working, i have tons of tomatoes!
<user1> Good for you!
<user1> People just don't seem to pay attention when they are in a hurry.
<user0> Yes, exactly! They are always speeding or cutting you off. And of course no blinker use!
<user1> That's the part that bothers me the most. When they just cut in front of you with no warning.
<user1> I know a lot of people in real life through that kind of stuff. Has been pretty great for me after 11 years. How is it for you so far.
<user0> I'd say it's going pretty well, we eventually got married! How did you meet your friends?
<user1> Well we met through going to conventions and i even visited some myself. Really great bunch of people and i see places.
<user1> well you sound like a good person
<user0> Thanks, I hope I am. You sound like one too
<user1> why thank you!
<user0> because you gave me a compliment, which I feel is a genuine one
<user0> Oh wow. That's crazy.
<user1> Yes, it was a very interesting time. I wish to continue talking to her despite living in different locations
<user0> I'm glad you made amends then and no drama.
<user0> That's pretty amazing. She must be skillful regardless.
<user1> She really is. It just shows that you don't need to have a four-year degree in order to be successful.
<user0> Yea, experience and skills matter a lot more.
<user0> I am familiar with that.  That is frustrating.
<user1> Yeah...Even though I take her outside, 10 minutes later, she'll poop or pee in the house. Why!?
<user0> I ask myself the same thing.  Sometimes I think they get mad at something we do.
<user0> That is good. Do you have strong feeling for each other?
<user1> Definetly, he's my best friend forever.
<user0> That is cute
<user0> Things? Like what kind of things?
<user1> Like stuff falling off shelfes because a dog runs into them! Hah, crazy I know.
<user0> I know what you mean! I'm literally doing the same thing right now, babysitting my neighbor's dogs in her big two-story house, all alone. Makes me feel like someone's watching me...
<user0> Thats really good to hear.  Whats going on?
<user1> Nothing really! I just love that I can work at home and have time to clean or cook whenever I want.
<user0> I work from home too.  Its so nice to be able to do laundry and things on my breaks.  Im so productive around the house
<user1> Right? And no having to interact with others unless we choose too.
<user0> and I can stay in my PJs all day long!
<user0> Yeah, of course I can! That sounds heartless. Maybe that shows you who your friends truly are, and you should maybe look elsewhere... Could be a wake-up call.
<user1> Well the party was for me, hahaha they really got me on that one!
<user0> Oh, I misunderstood! I thought you meant you weren't invited to one that you later found out about. Hah! Then I guess the wake-up call is you have really good friends! So, you like surprise parties then? I never did.
<user0> What kinds of things are you talking about?
<user1> Owed money to my mother in law for something, $15, she reminded me in a less then nice way.
<user0> That's not very fair, a kind reminder could've gone a long way.
<user1> Exactly, especially since she owes me a lot more of something being paid over time.
<user1> I have been there many times.
<user0> O really? What's your favorite thing there?
<user1> I love going to the Spurs games.
<user1> Wow that is a long time ago.
<user0> Yes! i studied so hard, can you imagine how i feel? i cannot believe it!
<user1> Yes, where did you go to college?
<user1> That is so disgusting.  I hate seeing that!
<user0> Yea, he had eaten to much sugar and well, it didn't end well
<user1> Sugar will do that to kids every time.  Just don't let them on a  roller coaster to make it even worse.
<user1> That sounds really painful!  You should pick them up.
<user0> Yes, i was so mad i always tell them to pick the toys up.
<user1> They must not listen very well.
<user1> Qdoba is the BOMB! Although, I think I prefer Chipotle slightly more.
<user0> No way. queso all the way! They don't have one near by but she was traveling and the airport up north did.
<user1> Yeah, but Chipotle has queso now! But, yeah, it isn't as good as Qdoba queso. 
<user1> Wow! How is that even possible?
<user0> Well they are called wonder kids! i was in wonder, i also read about one who just graduated from college at age 11
<user1> I wonder if they ever feel like they don't get a childhood?
<user1> Sounds like you are lucky.
<user0> Yea, he's become the best manager in his market in just 3 years.
<user1> That is great!
<user1> I figure your son is pretty happy as well.
<user0> Yes! i love him so dad, but i feel like my own achievement since i teach him how to play, he dedicated the three goals to me!
<user1> couldn't ask for a better day
<user1> That is no fun, you always hope that first one hits so they are more receptive the rest of the time
<user0> Yeah, and I really thought it was a decent story.  Nothing ground breaking, but at least should have gotten a chuckle.
<user1> Well there is always next time!
<user1> you should take the dogs to a dog park after work and meet people!
<user0> That's a good idea.  I don't know where there's a dog park near me, I should look into that.
<user1> Definitely. I think even Waze app will tell you in you search 'around me'. 
<user1> Wow, that is sweet of him, does he have a crush on you?
<user0> It was a nice gesture on his part. But I do not know
<user1> Huh, well maybe he is starting his campaign lol
<user0> But beyond that. Small gestures make others' lives happier
<user0> What type of dog is it?
<user1> A Pomeranian.  I don't have anything against that type of dog specifically, but this one is just terrible.
<user0> I get that, some are just not well trained at all
<user0> Oh? That's not good. Do you think he has lots of secrets?
<user1> I think so ... I'm a little worried, because of the situation
<user0> I'm sorry :( I do hope things can be worked out
<user1> Thank you for your solidarity
<user1> I assume you don't get to see them often?
<user0> Yeah, we moved away a few months after the wedding for my wife to go to Graduate school.
<user1> That's too bad. I bet you miss them.
<user1> Sorry to hear about the bad news.
<user0> Thank you for your solidarity
<user1> How long ago did she die?
<user0> seven years .... I miss her
<user0> I hope you got it.
<user1> I did actually!  It's a good job, especially since the market where I am isn't great for my field.
<user0> Congrats! You deserve it for keeping your faith!
<user0> How old is she?
<user1> She is 9 years old but she is a very focused girl
<user0> Well, you know she'll get over it, but it does hurt.
<user1> that's right ... but I think I've surpassed
<user1> oh, how nice. What are your plans in that regard for the future?
<user0> have my own restaurant
<user1> What a dream come true for you that'll be.
<user0> with work, effort and clarity in the goal ... I will surely arrive
<user0> Oh man, bills. That's awesome!
<user1> yes, such a relieve!
<user0> Does anyone help you with the bills?
<user0> awh thats so sweet how long have you two known one another? 
<user1> We are 12 years old, but we have had difficult moments, but we have overcome it
<user0> sounds like a great friendship! 
<user1> That's right ... I'm happy
<user1> Oh no. How old is he?
<user0> He is 12 years old, but he must understand that friendship is something sacred
<user1> Friendship is special. Did he do something to his friend?
<user0> he hit him and said a bad word
<user0> Man, that's gotta be a horrible feeling. I think it would help if you try not to compare yourself to others.
<user1> I do my best but sometimes that's super hard. I guess that's just one of those things everyone got to deal with. 
<user0> I hope things turn out better for you. Keep fighting.
<user1> You too, thank you! 
<user1> Oh man, that's awesome. I hope you get it!
<user0> Thanks a bunch! It pays much better than my current job, so I really hope I do, but I think I got it in the bag.
<user1> Glad you rocked that interview. Sounds like it's gonna be a sweet gig.
<user1> Awww I bet that brought back memories.
<user0> It really did. It kinda made me sad, because it was all tattered and dirty. I ended up washing it.
<user1> What will you do with it now?
<user1> How so?
<user0> Parents are more worried about appearances than learning. It's about school supplies not new Jordans or under armor. 
<user1> That's pretty much teaching their kids to worry about appearances than learning, too. That's too bad.
<user1> Did you name it?
<user0> I did! His name is Alphy.
<user1> That's cute. I bet he's happy.
<user1> You kinda want to hold their hand, but you know it's best they solve some problems on their own. You can't be with them all the time.
<user0> I know, they mommy in me wants to just jump in and fix it all like I used to
<user1> It is truely for the best. Try not to worry.
<user1> that's amazing! She must be excited.
<user0> She is so excited. She's even making more than I am.
<user1> Must be nice to have more income coming into the family.
<user1> Is he going to be okay?
<user0> Yeah, it was ear mites and he got medicine for it. You can tell he isn't feeling good from side effects so I've been babying him.
<user1> Well I bet he appreciates that. We all want to be babied sometimes.
<user1> Lol. Did you tell her? You can just buy another one.
<user0> lol I didn't tell her...Should i?
<user1> Just buy another one and don't eat it. lol
<user1> That's sucks. Does the culprit know?
<user0> Yeah, that's the worst part. They warned me that I was going to get yelled at because of something they did.
<user1> That is unacceptable. What are you going to do?
<user1> That sounds so fun! 
<user0> I've never been, so it's going to be an amazing experience. I'm a little nervous that I'll get seasick.
<user1> Take some medication with you just in case.
<user1> So...what happened to her
<user0> she died ... my mother
<user1> In real life? Or are you making this up
<user0> It is true...
<user0> I've never imagined something like that before. Where did you see this?
<user1> in a big dog ... in the park
<user0> That's nuts. Did the owner do anything?
<user1> I did not have the strength to control it
<user1> I suffer a lot too when my wife is gone. What happened to him?
<user0> He passed away from cancer.
<user1> Ah, the evil cancer. Took my grandmother as well. I am sure he's off in a better place now.
<user1> Nice! How old is your nephew?
<user0> 11, he wants to see us for more then 2 weeks a year.
<user1> That's good. Gotta build and maintain those family bonds. I should be doing the same once my nephew gets older.
<user1> That sucks. Can you make it up to her somehow?
<user0> I'll have to buy her another piece of tupperwear, it seems silly but it's expensive stuff!
<user1> At least those things come in sets, so you can keep part of it?
<user0> I may do that!
<user0> It is a work award or something?
<user1> Its an award due to achieving my work I have worked hard for
<user0> I am sure you are going to get it.
<user1> I appreciate that. Thank you
<user1> Why Thank you!
<user0> No problem! Everything will work out in the end. No need to worry.
<user1> THanks for being so understanding!  I feel a little better now.
<user1> I know what you mean. Did you get the job?
<user0> I did! The company does something that I actually like -- a panel interview vs a series of one-on-ones. Have you ever had an interview like that?
<user1> I have not. What is it?
<user0> It just means you're in a room with several representatives from different parts of the company. To me, that helps it feel more like a conversation -- and it's more time efficient too!
<user0> There are some bad parents out there, that's for sure. Is it hard to be a parent?
<user1> It is when it comes to all the unexpected stuff. Went to the mall today and lady was letting her toddler run all over the mall smelling like a dirty litter box. It smelled horrible.
<user0> Lol, that is terrible. She should have changed his diaper before leaving the house what the heck...
<user0> That sucks. Maybe it's time to get new friends?
<user1> Well, for the most part it's my family. My husband, kids and pets. I know they're not deaf and it's frustrating!
<user0> Don't worry, it will get better. I know you deserve better
<user0> I know exactly what you mean. My sister is entering her teenage years. I feel like it's all I can do to just not be annoying to her, so I can't even imagine what it's like for a mom.
<user1> Yeah, luckily we had a fun girls evening out today. We went out to eat and did a bunch of shopping.
<user0> That's good! All it takes is a good day once in a while to keep things on track until they get older. My mom just tries to be as patient and considerate with my sister so that she still feels motivated to communicate with her.
<user0> Where are you going?
<user1> I'm going to visit the national parks in california... well the ones not on fire.
<user0> I've never been to California.
<user0> That must of been terrible.
<user1> It WAS. Since she was wet, the dirt got stuck inside her fur. She was even harder to clean the second time around.
<user0> Did anyone help you?
<user0> You're making me want to do the same thing. That sounds great!
<user1> Yeah, it's been a great day. Thinking about moving to the bed and going to sleep next.
<user0> Nothing like relaxing and getting your body ready for a night of good sleep!
<user0> Was it on the phone or in person?
<user1> It was in person. We mostly interviewed in a conference room, then we took a lab tour afterwards.
<user0> How did you do?
<user0> What are you referring to?
<user1> yes my behavior refereed to people
<user0> That is nce
<user0> thank you for what?
<user1> nothing
<user0> okay
<user0> you're welcome, but for what?
<user1> nothing
<user0> ok then lol
<user0> Cool. Thats a fun hobby.
<user1> thank you
<user0> Well habe fun I guess.
<user0> Oh no, what happened?
<user1> placed an order online and the appliance place didnt have it, so they gave me something else without telling me
<user0> Oh, that's odd! I'm sorry they didn't tell you what was going on. 
<user1> Thanks for hearing me out. I filed a complaint at the council. I hope they listen
<user0> No problem! I hope so too. Good luck with that!
<user0> really?
<user1> yes. Makes me value human-human interaction a lot more. I had to go to the grocery store to feel ok
<user0> ok
<user0> Who was your rep?
<user1> the president represented us at this association
<user0> Aha. What was the association?
<user1> International Ceramic trading
<user1> Did you got bored?
<user0> I kept myself occupied with movies and video games. But it wasn't the same as having real company.
<user1> I understand.
<user1> That is a very long drive! How long will it take to get there?
<user0> About an hour. But it'll be worth it.
<user1> It must be very good, if you're willing to go that far!
<user1> Wow, you're very lucky. Do you share the facilities with other people?
<user0> Yes but there's hardly anyone else who uses them because they only come for 2 weeks out of the year for a vacation. I'm here permanently.
<user1> Which part of the country are you in? Are you by the beach?
<user1> Was it fun?
<user0> It was so much fun. I thought is was going to be another normal day. Wake up, go to work, etc. but I was wrong about that!
<user1> Was it recently? Happy Birthday
<user0> Yes, last week. Thank you!
<user0> Oh goodness, what happened for the past 3 weeks?
<user1> She went to visit her family
<user0> Oh, I was thinking something bad happened.
<user0> Sorry to hear this! I can understand your pain. 
<user1> Thank you for your solidarity
<user0> Take care of yourself and your family.
<user1> thanks
<user1> I am sure it will be fine, do you have a preference
<user0> Well it's a boy. Which is what I have been wanting since we met
<user1> I am happy for you then
<user1> That is good, it is very important to be loyal in a healthy relationship!
<user0> It is the most important thing to me. I have told her since day one, which was 5 years ago now.
<user1> Good for you! I wish more people were like this, unlike my ex! 
<user1> You should channel that envy into motivation!
<user0> I agree, if I work hard I could buy that truck. 
<user1> Exactly, be positive and you can buy one for yourself!
<user0> I should, I just need the drive to get out there and do it. I need to stop wasting money.
<user0> That is a great attitude to have!  It is great to have an optimistic approach to life.
<user1> If I really like to be positive, despite the difficulties
<user0> I feel the same way.  We are a glass half full kind of people!
<user1> so it is ... a big hug
<user1> oh poor thing, is she at least getting better?
<user0> It seems so. Sleeping all day today lol
<user1> haha that must be nice too though, you get your own alone time for the most part!
<user1> I see, you must have felt hopeful
<user0> I gave thanks in spite of the difficulties
<user1> Good, one should always be positive
<user0> thank you for your comments
<user0> thats adorable how old is she? 
<user1> she is 9 years old ... she is a nice girl
<user0> she sounds like it 
<user1> that's right ... thanks for your comment
<user1> That's a pretty heavy realization...better tell him now that regret it later
<user0> You're right
<user1> Best of luck to you
<user0> thanks
<user0> what are your options? 
<user1> There's a lot of openings for tech jobs lately, especially technical support.
<user0> oh yeah thats always going to be up and coming for sure 
<user0> It is an excellent opportunity, to know other people and places, to open up to the possibility, I assure you that it will go to you very well
<user1> I'm sure it is great for her, but it makes me feel a little unsure of what to do with myself.
<user0> You do the same thing ... the opportunity is for both
<user0> That sounds like it's rough, did your father accept your apology?
<user1> yes, but I feel like a cockroach
<user0> Well, I'm sure he understands, and you shouldn't feel too bad, as long as you apologized you're fine.
<user1> thanks
<user1> it happens we have to reward ourselves sometimes. dark chocolate is actually good for you! 
<user0> But I'm supposed to be on a diet! I can't lose weight if I have no self control :(
<user1> hey it was just one day! you got this... work extra hard for the next 5 days! 
<user1> That's awesome
<user0> He is such a hard working man! He works so much so i could stay home with our baby
<user1> I'm sure your supportiveness inspires him to work as hard as he does
<user1> I totally feel you on that. I swear my neighbors have to be the loudest at night slamming their car doors and yelling outside right in front of my bedroom window. 
<user0> Ugh, that's the worst.  Thankfully we're on the second floor so we don't have to deal with car noise too much.
<user1> My bedroom is first floor, and literally maybe 4 feet from the parking lot. Lucky me. Lucky you tho too with animals. lol 
<user1> Did you retrace your steps
<user0> I've been to so many places on that day it would be really hard to do it
<user1> I used to lose stuff all the time.  Then I learned to relax and actively imagine all the places I'd been to.  It worked for me then, found a G-shock watch a pair of nikes and my wallet
<user1> that's great! I bet they are equally excited if not more :) are you travelling alone?
<user0> no, with my little baby. they've never met my son, they can't wait
<user1> oh i bet! you guys will have such a wonderful time together
<user1> I would be too, that is a long time!
<user0> Yeah, it's especially long since we only recently moved and I don't really know anyone outside of work.
<user1> Wow that would make for a lonely timeframe
<user1> Wow did youcall someone about that?
<user0> No point. Their smoke alarm went off and management don't care anyway.
<user1> Wow, that sucks, that is why I wanna live all alone!
<user0> Me too! I really don't appreciate their lack of manners - it's as if they own the whole complex!
<user0> Oh my, did they notice you farted?
<user1> she did, she didn't say anything but i know she heard it
<user0> Must have rather awkward. Remember, farting is just natural and I am sure she understands that.
<user0> I am sorry, how have you been passing the time
<user1> Mostly been playing video games, but it's so boring without her.
<user0> I love video games, you should buy a switch!
<user0> that is a very optimistic way to look at life . i should actually look at life that way too instead of getting overwhelmed when things do not go my way
<user1> For me it was a hard learning ... but after many blows ... I assimilated it
<user0> how long have you looked at life this way? is it sustainable ?
<user1> for a year ... you assimilate it when you realize that you are responsible ... neither the people nor the circumstances are responsible
<user0> this is completely true. it involves totally re conditioning the mind .
<user1> condition the mind and spirit
<user0> i would totally attempt it 
<user0> I am so very sorry. Have you had time to talk about it
<user1> yes, I talk about it but it really does not help much. I pray a lot and that gives me some comfort 
<user0> that's good prayer can comfort, maybe you should talk to your pastor
<user1> I dont have a pastor, or a church I can go to. I meditate and I pray and I watch preachers on Sunday morning tv. All of those do help some. 
<user1> Ooh, that's a big jump. I was considering the same thing, but I' one state above :)
<user0> Ohh! Did you change your mind? I'm trying to convince myself that it's going to be better for me to make the move.
<user1> I put it on hold until I fly up there this year to check things out. It's quite a big decision, and I would recommend going there for a while just to see what it's like
<user1> Yes, realistically I wish it were possible to do that everyday but general stresses of life get in the way 
<user0> that's right ... but I dedicate an hour to do that, to my children I kiss them, my neighbor smiled at him and from life I try to learn something
<user1> Maybe thats a good idea, to try and set aside a small amount of time a day to do it instead of trying to do it all the time along with everything else going on. Good idea!
<user0> It makes me feel good that my reflection serves you ... I send you a smile
<user0> Do you have any hobbies that may help you to meet people?
<user1> not really. i love playing video games and watch tv. i'm socially awkward
<user0> Same here.  Try to take advantage of your gaming and be more outgoing during gametime.
<user0> You must be ver
<user1> I'm assuming you got cut off somehow :P  I'm very happy she's coming back.
<user0> *very excited.  (oops).  Where did she go?
<user1> Germany for a language immersion course.
<user1> where are you going
<user0> A short weekend trip to the ozarks for a float trip on spring fed white water. 
<user1> that sounds like fun, where in the ozakrs?
<user0> Down close to the border line of arkansas and the ozarks. It is around the current river 
<user0> Sounds like you made the right decision.  What a bunch of A-holes
<user1> Yeah, it was weird, the caterer was a woman so I can't imagine it was like a sexism thing, but she responded to me almost instantly every time.
<user0> Hm maybe she liked you ha
<user0> Free pizza is good! How did you get it?
<user1> The pizza took forever to get delivered so I asked if it was free.  The delivery girl, who was brand new, didn't know so she just didn't charge me.
<user0> That is awesome!
<user1> Well, I like free pizza for sure. But I still felt a bit concerned that they might take the cost of it out of her paycheck.
<user1> It was fine how about you?
<user0> yeah good. whats your name?
<user1> I'm not sure I feel comfortable telling you as we just met.
<user0> oh its fine nice to chat with you unknown friend
<user0> My day was great so far!  How about you?
<user1> yeah fine great day
<user0> That is good to hear!  I'm am sure you are grateful to experience such a good day!
<user1> yeah nice to talk to you.
<user1> Oh that sucks :( Maybe organize the socks better?
<user0> My room was messy as there was a party last night in my house and friends were enjoying in whole house. That is the reason.
<user1> Ah. Well, chalk it up to one of those funny but awkward moments of life then!
<user0> ohh
<user0> That's great! When will you find out?
<user1> It should be a couple weeks, assuming they go at the pace they said they would.
<user0> Good luck! I hope you get it.
<user0> I know how it feels to be homesick, but you have to put your wife first.
<user1> Yeah, definitely, that's why I went ahead with the move.  I'm just not very good at meeting people, so it can be tough.
<user0> You and your wife should go out to events and try to meet new people.
<user0> Ohh man, that is a long time to be alone.  What are you going to do while she is gone?
<user1> Mostly work and hang out with the dogs.  We just moved recently and I don't really know anyone outside of work.
<user0> I'm sorry.  Where did she go?
<user1> Germany for a language course.
<user1> What happened? Did someone bump on your car?
<user0> No, the person cut in front of some other people.  I confronted him about it and we got into a shouting match.
<user1> Be carefull , you don't know the cray people that is out there.
<user0> Yes, afterwards I regretted the confrontation.  I thought I could have easily been shot.
<user0> That must have been awkward.
<user1> Fortunately the owner didn't see me before I got off, but I sure felt stupid about it.
<user0> Don't worry about it. It happens to the best of us.
<user1> Indeed.  And next time I'll be sure to double-check whose it is before I come aboard.
<user1> Nostalgia can be wonderful, can't it?
<user0> It can, but it can also hurt sometimes.  It's probably just nostalgia hardcore, but sometimes I wish I could go back to that time.
<user1> I feel the same when listening to 90s alternative music
<user1> What was going on!?
<user0> My friend and her mom were fighting about money, and my friend's daughters were wanting attention.
<user1> sounds like a lot of drama ugh i hope you get some rest tonight 
<user0> I hope so too. I plan on going back to my place just to get away from all of this.
<user0> that's really good you feel pretty secure about it then?
<user1> The interviewer told me that I was his favorite interview so far. And I think my qualifications are a really good match for the company.
<user0> oh wow then that is really good! For someone to say that! You should be very proud of yourself.
<user0> Thar was an embarasing moment for sure
<user1> Yeah, I don't like calling people out in general, don't know what made me think to do it this time.
<user0> Maybe you are felling lonely these days?
<user0> Did you have an enemy or someone as a suspect?
<user1> I think the mailman might be mad at me because I keep ordering heavy items.
<user0> Weird reaction. I feel like he should just do his job and not key your car.
<user0> What are you worrying about?
<user1> I had an abnormal ekg and they did a stress test on my heart to make sure everything's alright.
<user0> Well, I hope it's alright, heart problems is not something you should take lightly.
<user1> Absolutely! I'm just over-worrying because I've always been so healthy. Just a little stressed out.
<user1> What is your favorite memory with your friends?
<user0> Playing outside in the summer time. Many fun summer times. Swimming holes, icecream, catching fireflies.
<user1> That sounds like so much fun! I'm glad you got to go back to revisit.
<user0> Me too!
<user0> You deserved for graduating.
<user1> Thanks, now all I got to do is get a real career. I couldn't have done it with out them.
<user0> Just keep working hard and make them proud.
<user0> I'm glad to hear you have something you can lean on in hard times. I'm personally an Atheist but I can respect someone with faith.
<user1> I was told once by a dear departed friend that "what ever floats a persons boat it good because it keeps people sane as long as no one is being hurt. 
<user0> I absolutely agree. As long as you aren't hurting anyone, do whatever you please!
<user1> yeh to that
<user1> Oh man, I'm sorry to hear that! It doesn't necessarily mean it went bad, though. Maybe they just had a more qualified candidate?
<user0> I'm just pretty embarrassed, I was so confident. This whole job hunting adventure has been a complete nightmare.
<user1> Keep your head up! Job hunting is usually stressful for most people. You got this!
<user1> I'm not jealous of my co-worker though?  What makes you think i'm jealous?
<user0> You said that you were envious of his promotion. It is understandable though.
<user1> I didn't say that.
<user0> Okay, I am glad to hear that you are no longer feeling jealous.
<user0> That would be sad, do you keep him in a cage?
<user1> Fortunately, no. I let him run around the house, but I feel like he gets bored, so I keep the TV on for him.
<user0> That's nice, what does he enjoy watching?
<user0> Absolutely. Although the world isn't so black and white. Sometimes a person may have to steal to survive. Is it really wrong then?
<user1> If that is the case, I can understand why they had to do it. In circumstances where someone is stealing solely for unneeded person gain, then it is most definitely wrong.
<user0> I agree. Stealing someone else's possession when it wasn't necessary for your survival is despicable! I hate a thief!
<user0> That's so sad, I'm so sorry you had to go through that. How did it happen?
<user1> My mother was walking her in a park and the dog fell down a cliff.  She was never found or recovered.
<user0> My goodness, that sounds like a tragedy. I'm sure she was a great dog friend of yours.
<user1> Yes, I loved her a lot.  It took a long time to get over but it was quite a long time ago at this point.
<user1> Do you have some big plans for the visit?
<user0> Probably not, because she is 6 months pregnant. Her husband is in the military and is away, so she will be here when she has her baby. 
<user1> Uh oh, have you ever delivered a baby before?
<user0> Oh no! And I don't plan on it! I'll leave that to the doctors! 
<user1> Oh right, I am a doctor.
<user0> Oh cool! What kind of doctor?
<user1> I am a baby delivering doctor!
<user1> What was the accomplishment again?
<user0> My mother just graduated from nursing school in her 50's. She put in a lot of effort, and she proved to herself and others that she could do it.
<user1> Wow, that's amazing. What made her want to go back to school?
<user1> What about this homeless person had you reevaluating things?
<user0> Lately, I've been thinking how miserable I am at my job. As terrible as it sounds, when I saw him, I thought life could be much worse.
<user1> What's been bothering you at work? Are you not being fulfilled enough?
<user1> Oh no! I hope it didn't fall on anything or anyone!
<user0> No, it missed everything but the lawn. And then my neighbor was nice enough to bring over his chainsaw and help me cut it up for disposal.
<user1> Oh thats really nice! Its important to help each other out when things like that happen!
<user1> Who??? Male or female.Actor or singer?
<user0> She's a female singer. It sort of burns me up because I feel like she doesn't deserve it and she's rather manipulative.
<user1> Please tell me who she is!!!!!
<user0> Sorry, I won't do that.  But pick the female singer you dislike the most and pretend it's her.
<user0> I know exactly how you feel, I've been slipping back into paycheck to paycheck living recently. It was so much better when I had the money to pay for everything.
<user1> Didn't the sun always shine back then, when we were happy and young and had money?!
<user0> Hahaha yes, you are so right. Then again, I'm a Christian so I am also comforted when I remember that we have a real, more important and awesome life to look forward to one day.
<user1> That's true. I still like to look fondly upon the past, but the future will be bright, too.
<user1> Wow, that's terrible. Was anything stolen or damaged?
<user0> Yes, my TV was stolen. They also clogged every toilet in my apartment. I think they have just eaten Thai food.
<user1> What a story, it's just unbelievable how these robbers have absolutely no morals.
<user1> That is is awful.Did you call the cops
<user0> I did, they are investigating currently. I hope they find the hoodlums.
<user1> You should install security cameras outside your house.
<user1> That's rough man. Got any back up interviews lined up?
<user0> Not as of now. I have applied to a couple of other jobs.
<user1> I hope that you hear back from them soon. It ain't going to be rough forever - someone has got to recognize your worth eventually!
<user1> Oh no, that is terrible! What happened? What did you do!
<user0> I ran out of the gym crying, and the whole class pointed and laughed. 
<user1> I am so sorry that happened to you!
<user1> Yuck, sounds like an unpleasant feeling. How do you even get hair up there!
<user0> She keeps walking across my chest and rubs on my face as she walks across. I know she's being sweet but it tickles. 
<user1> Well, at least she loves you. Maybe shoving all her hair up your nose is her way of telling you that.
<user1> Oh really?! Where you headed too?
<user0> We are heading to Somalia! We had some business dealings to attend to, and we will be seeing the ocean as well!
<user1> Wow! Thats on the east side of Africa isn't it? 
<user1> Did you have a severe diarreia or something?
<user0> Yes, it is a legitimate medical condition. I have irritable bowl syndrome.
<user1> I am sure your friend will forgive you.
<user1> Oh cool! How did you win it? 
<user0> It was for a chess competition. 
<user1> Oh cool! I love chess! What did you win? 
<user0> They gave a cash money of 200$. Isn't that cool? Have you won any?
<user0> Wow that's annoying, my husband is always telling me about his co-workers being the same way. 
<user1> Yes, it is quite frustrating. I don't mind listening to people, but I would like them to ask how I am doing from time to time.
<user0> Yeah I see what you mean. Hopefully he might realize eventually.
<user0> Sometimes it is uncomfortable to have to wait for something or someone.
<user1> Yeah it is. I just thought that's what it would be, so it dashed my hopes when it wasn't. I just got keep waiting, I guess.
<user0> Well, a wise man said that having patience was a virtue, I think you're becoming a more virtuous person by waiting.
<user0> I think you should always focus on your strength then it won't matter who is there and what they say
<user1> That is good advice. I feel better about this.
<user0> Also having at least one  friend in such meetings  would help. Next time  go with someone you know
<user0> That's great, how wonderful! I hope y'all had a good time.
<user1> It was like we just started where we left off over 20 years ago. It was like we just seen each last week, not 20 years ago.
<user0> How great, I'm glad to hear that.
<user0> How old was the child?
<user1> She couldn't have been older than one!
<user0> Wow, that's awfully young for that kind of thing.
<user0> Oh that's not good. It is hard to put all your effort in and have it go nowhere
<user1> It is.  We're in the process of revamping and coming up with some new and different ideas so hopefully we can do some revisions and get better results.
<user0> Sometimes revamping leads to more amazing results than you could have orginially anticipated
<user1> That's what I'm hoping for. It's kinda fun when you have to reach into your bag of tricks to see if anything new is there!  
<user1> Oh no! Are you going away this weekend?
<user0> Yes, I am going on a business trip by my son has an important tennis match this weekend. I don't know what I'll do if my Aunt doesn't answer soon.
<user1> Hopefully, she answers soon. Maybe she's taking a nap or is in the shower.
<user1> I am in the same boat, but I think that I can still be very happy and very content with the little bit of money or lack of I have. 
<user0> That's good to know. No wonder we are here doing these tasks
<user1> How funny! I know how you feel though. I have always been poor.
<user0> ME TOO. MY Parents have always suffered and so have I. It is so unfair
<user1> Happiness is within and I seek that all the time. Even rich people are sad and unhappy. 
<user0> That is so true. But to lead a happy life, money is necessary to some extent.
<user0> Why? How did that happen?
<user1> Becaue I am stuck at a mine site and no one will buy me out. No one wants to live at a mine site with land collapsing everywhere. 
<user0> That's so sad. I feel sorry for you. 
<user1> I feel sorry for me too!
<user0> Yeah. Do you have back up plans for this issue?
<user0> That's nice, I'm glad you feel that way.
<user1> Yes, what about you? Do you feel likewise?
<user0> I do feel that way, I try to always have a Christian attitude.
<user1> Do you follow any particular denomination?
<user1> That's nice of her! It's always good to have friends to fall on
<user0> yes, and she also helped me out and paid one of my bills when i was struggling with money
<user1> Oh, that's even better. That's truly a friend you can rely on. You're very fortunate.
<user1> Skateboarders have some serious skills! I can barely walk a straight line.
<user0> I know, right?!  I tried skateboarding once when I was a kid, made it to being able to kind of not fall over in a straight line, never managed to do anything else.
<user1> We all have different talents. Mine do not lie in those kind of stunts either lol! 
<user1> Maybe you could try to better that?
<user0> I definitely should! I should be nicer to other moms and don't judge them
<user1> You could start a trend.
<user1> He will make it
<user0> I know he will, i just wish i could help him. I gave him Tylenol but he was still pretty cranky
<user1> It will help eventually
<user1> That must have been scary. It could have gone really badly.
<user0> Yeah, I was really worried.  My bigger dog got really protective of the smaller one, but thankfully they didn't actually get into a fight.
<user1> I hope the owner knows better next time.
<user1> Oh man! I hear you. I rescue animals and it is VERY hard to potty train them!
<user0> I can imagine a rescue, generally being a little bit older than a fresh 8 week old someone would get, can be much harder.. It's a painful process for sure!
<user1> For sure! It is much like potty training a kid. Actually I think dogs are easier then kids lol!
<user1> THat is stressful.  Are they ok?
<user0> Yeah, he's fine now.  It was some kind of stomach thing, but he got medicine and rest and is good now.
<user1> That is really good to hear
<user1> I certainly do.  Lucky to be healthy and able
<user0> I always try to look for the small things. I got to see a hummingbird today and that was great. Anything small in your life make a big impact?
<user1> Good question.  I am thankful to be able to park my car in my garage!
<user0> Oh I can agree with that completely! 
<user0> I hope you get the job! What was the position you applied for?
<user1> A lab manager at a university.  I've got my fingers crossed!
<user0> That sounds like it pays nice?
<user0> No. Why do you ask?
<user1> I've had to recently. Its been really tough.
<user0> I'm sorry to hear that. How far along in the process are you?
<user0> I actually do not have any kids right now
<user1> My kids love to tell me what they are doing in their video games. It was cute at first, but you can only listen to someone talk about Stardew Valley for so long.
<user0> I heard that was a really fun game though!
<user0> Seems like we all have. Some people shirk having to though.
<user1> Yeah, I'm not so lucky. My wifes been sick and I've been taking care of her recently.
<user0> Oh no.I hope she gets better.
<user0> Well that's good, sometimes it's our failures that really show us what we're made of. 
<user1> I agree, I practiced and practiced and I was pleased when I passed my third time. Persistence is key.
<user0> Congratulations. I am in my twenties and still can't drive so hopefully I will get my license next year.
<user0> Did you say anything to someone?
<user1> I reported it! I was shocked and grossed out, how can a place like that operate!?
<user0> a Burger King near me got shut down for that!
<user0> No, I do not have kids. Yours?
<user1> My daughter skateboards. She went down the big ramp the other day. It was so cool.
<user0> I bet you were really proud!
<user0> Wow. Thats hard to believe lol.
<user1> I was so concerned about getting to work I forgot to throw them on, I was so in shock, even the neighbors saw. It was bad.
<user0> Yeah, it sounds that way.
<user0> That must of been a pain! I hate waiting in lines for cashiers, they are so slow sometimes.
<user1> The cashier couldn't help it. The store should hire more people.
<user0> Stores should really open more checkouts when it is busy, especially during rush our!
<user0> Man, I'm so jealous of you. I love that new puppy stage, as tumultuous as it can be. There's just so much emotion and "new feelings" going on as you watch it grow.
<user1> I agree with you, the joy of adding a new member to the family is a wave of emotions, positive ones of course!
<user0> Yeah, but then there's also those late nights where you have to take them out because they're not used to holding their pee/poop in. And also them peeing and pooping in the house as they learn not to do that to begin with. They just have unlimited energy, so it's hard to keep up sometimes, but also fun!
<user0> What were simpler times?
<user1> Childhood when you did not have so much to worry about.
<user0> Ah, I see. Had a great childhood, hu?
<user1> It was great, so much time running around outside without a care in the world.
<user1> Congrats! That would be really exciting. What was your project?
<user0> My project was to show what farm poop produced the most gas when it decomposed. I put the poop in a bottle with a balloon on top. Whatever balloon grew the largest, was the one that released the most gas.
<user1> That's a very interesting topic. I would have loved to have seen that!
<user1> I know what that's like. I have three kids.
<user0> how did you cope with all the crying? We've been co sleeping since birth and it's breaking my heart to hear him cry
<user1> They never slept in the crib lol. I won't even make my son get a haircut because he cries so much when the clippers get close. I'm the wrong one to come to for advice lol
<user1> That sounds heavenly
<user0> It was! We hadn't been able to go on a vacation for a couple of years, due to personal reasons, so you can imagine how we felt when we went!
<user1> I envy you.  Have fun!
<user1> Time sure does fly and change is inevitable
<user0> Yes, that's true. I still can imagine when he was waking up Christmas morning to see what Santa brought when he was 5.
<user1> Thinking about past events can be very nostalgic
<user1> what happened?
<user0> Mys husbands job sucks and they had to cancel his vacation because they arnt staffed right.
<user1> time to find a new job it sounds like! good luck
<user1> Awesome! What is he in college for?
<user0> He's going to be an Aerospace Engineer! We are very proud of him and how dedicated he is to achieving his dream.
<user1> Holy goodness! That is really specialized. You should be very proud! :)
<user1> That is very good to hear, hopefully things truly turn around for him.
<user0> I hope so. Do you have any kids?
<user1> Not yet, i just have one dog.
<user1> Oh that's neat! Did you find anything good?
<user0> Well, kinda... I got a bunch of old Beanie Babies, haha.
<user1> Oh I remember when those came out and everyone thought they were going to be worth millions someday! 
<user0> I know! They were 25 cents each... it was crazy. They had the coolest store there with all sorts of old stuff from the 80s and 90s. 
<user0> Wow, that's incredible. I don't even make my own bed. 
<user1> haha me either most days! I was really proud of her and then she said she wanted more chore money! lol
<user0> Of course... haha. Why doesn't anyone pay adults to make their beds?
<user0> Wow, that sounds very disgusting.
<user1> It looked so horrible. I thought for sure the baby was as good as dead.
<user0> I hope the baby rat is okay.
<user1> She's great. I gave her some medicine and she healed miraculously. It was almost unbelievable!
<user1> I'm so sorry but great to hear she is better now!
<user0> Thanks, she is. She had a blood clot in her leg and we didn't know it, so it could have been much, much worse. I can't even express how glad I was when she was better!
<user1> Well I'm glad to hear it's resolved.
<user1> Oh that's nice, I love doing that. Did the cat seem happy?
<user0> The cat appeared very relaxed, but I could tell it was very pensive about my presence. It took some time to develop some sort of trust.
<user1> Well how nice, that must have been fun.
<user1> Wow that must have been scary!
<user0> If that wasn't frightening enough, I ended up getting chased by a stranger while I was looking for my camp mates!
<user1> How long were you lost for?
<user1> Wow back up there friend, what are you talking about?
<user0> I wish it never happened now. 
<user1> Context, what the heck are you talking about?
<user0> she was 8
<user1> Seriously what the hell are you talking about??
<user1> Being jealous of another person is a perfectly fine response. Despite this, you never know what is going on behind the scenes, she may have taken out huge loans just to fund her trips.
<user0> Yes, true, I know they tend to let bills go for things like that, which I don't do. 
<user1> I bet you would go on many vacations if you did the same as her. Instead, you are being a responsible person and doing what is best for your future.
<user1> You just had a baby?! I didn't even know you were expecting!
<user0> He'll be here in about 3 months
<user1> I'm so happy for you! Have you decided on a name yet?
<user1> Good for you! I have heard many great things about keto. How are you finding it?
<user0> It's good so far. I was overwhelmed at first, but I rented some books from the library and got a Kindle Unlimited subscription to find some recipes and info.
<user1> Props to you for researching the diet without understanding how it works. Some people are just looking for ways to lose weight fast, but putting in effort goes a long way.
<user0> Thank you, I wanted to be completely ready, so I compiled meal plans and grocery lists first.
<user0> You must be over the moon happy.
<user1> I am. Especially when we saw the ultrasound. Takes after his dad if you know what I mean haha
<user0> Very funny. Have you decided on a name yet?
<user0> Happy belated Birthday! Did it turn out the way you had hoped?
<user1> Well, about that... my dad KNEW I wanted a pink car for my birthday. But...
<user0> What did you get instead?
<user1> A BLUE one! I'm so devastated. I don't know what to do.
<user1> Really? That is a good move
<user0> I was scared about it at first, but so far I have all A's. I must say, I'm proud of myself!
<user1> You have As because you have high interest in studying  
<user1> Wow, that is truly incredible! What is your secret?
<user0> As well as exercise and diet, by far the most important thing is strong will and determination.
<user1> That is so true! You are a true weight loss warrior I think!
<user1> Do you like it now?
<user0> Well, first I tried whole milk, and that was gross. But I just tried 2% milk, and I like it!
<user1> I like 2% as well.  It's perfect for cereal and chocolate milk!
<user0> I agree! I'm so happy I can enjoy it now.
<user1> Have you tried 1%?
<user0> No, but I am satisfied with my choice. 
<user1> That's great.  2% is much more healthful than whole milk.
<user1> so very bad ya
<user0> Yes, well, it was just one of those things I know, but still was very tiring and can get to you after that drive.
<user1> ok
<user1> Oh no! :(   How are you taking it?
<user0> It's definitely a hard situation to take in. He had stopped using when we started dating and was off it for 2 years until we broke up. It's very discouraging.
<user1> Dang.  Please don't blame yourself.
<user1> Thats pretty long, how did you manage?
<user0> I wanted to pull my hair out lol. But, knew once we were past it, there was the beautiful ocean on the other side...finally!
<user1> Yea, something calming helps during fraustrating moments, but at least you know how the route is now
<user1> Nice! Who's Robby? Is that your husband?
<user0> Yes, how could you forget? It was a nice surprise, but then he said.. "happy anniversary."
<user1> Aha! Was it actually your anniversary today? Happy Anniversary!
<user0> Thanks, but I'm so embarrassed that I forgot!! D; 
<user0> Oh, wow... um, that's crazy. Why did you do that? 
<user1> I was attracted to her. She was older. The worst part was getting hit upside the head in front of her
<user0> I would imagine! I'd do the same thing if I was your dad, haha.
<user0> You sound like a caveman
<user1> Me am caveman. In cave was paint of cave wife. Wife hunt big mammoth.
<user0> Why you no hunt and send wife instead.
<user1> Me miss BC. Me miss wife.
<user1> Oh I can relate to that especially if you are not prepared for it, it can get really scary
<user0> Oh, we were totally unprepared. In fact, my partner and I were working out of state in a compromising environment. We had to double on back home to get our lives set up for the big change!
<user1> You guys will be alright trust me I  experienced same with my partner and now we are fine. Our kid is a teenager now. I am happy for you guys
<user1> Oh no! I'm not sure how all that works, but I thought that was fairly normal for a pregnat woman
<user0> Usually the sickness stops within the first few months, so the fact that I fell ill so much was worrisome. Despite it all, I had a healthy, bouncing baby boy. I never have felt more grateful in my life.
<user1> Well I'm glad for you! And for him! A new life is exciting
<user1> That's so sad. You did your best. How old was she?
<user0> She was 14. I got her when she was a puppy. Even though the situation was rough, I'm grateful for all the years we did get to spend together.
<user1> That's really good, though. It sounds like you gave her a great life.
<user1> Was he with you or just someone you wanted to be with?
<user0> I wanted her. But he had the money. And that's what she wanted
<user1> In that case, you are better off without her. 
<user1> Oh, wow, I wish my parents had done that! It would have saved me from the mountain of debt I have now
<user0> We felt it was best to make sure to get ready in advance and help as much as we can. But, I know all parents aren't able to do that, or feel they shouldn't, so I can see both sides!
<user1> Well, I've always been of the mindset that (if they can) they should help the first 2 years as that's usually the break-in period. After that, the child should be able to manage
<user1> I bet that felt good to get out and experience that!
<user0> It was definitely exciting for me! I haven't been able to play with a dog since my own passed away.
<user1> Oh I am sorry to hear that. I also enjoy dogs. They are one of life's great joys in my opinion.
<user1> You should take a vacation that will help you relax and see new stuff
<user0> I could definitely use one! However, I have a newborn so I'll have to wait a little while before we can go on some adventures!
<user1> Oh ok. In that case let someone very close like your mother come around to help you out. Having someone to talk to helps in times like this
<user1> That's awesome. Are you using any special types of lotion?
<user0> Nope! I believe it is mostly due to diet and lots of water. It's amazing how much the little changes can impact.
<user1> I'll have to do the same! I wish my skin looked better than it does.
<user1> You must be wealthy. I would love to visit NYC
<user0> I am, thanks, but I wouldn't go there... Becky STILL managed to get the same dress as me! I am so mad!
<user1> OMG! I know how you feel
<user1> Oh, me too! I love digging out my N64 and SNES from time to time.
<user0> Oh yeah? Cool. I like the old Sega Mega Drive games. The music is just classic on those games
<user1> Yes, that Yamaha sound chip was magical. We call it the Genesis over here.
<user1> Oh goodness, what was it?
<user0> It was a ghost! I ran into the kitchen to investigate, and I saw what looked like a white dress flapping out the window. 
<user1> Wow, that must have been a terrible experience.
<user1> so very nice.your doughter.
<user0> Yes, she has a natural talent, but really puts much practice and time into it. 
<user1> whove very nice ya and super talent.
<user1> What does what mean exactly?
<user0> this has obviously gone all wrong somewhere
<user1> Well whatever went wrong, I hope it can be fixed somehow.
<user0> 5
<user0> Oh no! Did you take the kitten to an animal hospital or care for it yourself?
<user1> I cared for it myself. Now she's my beloved cat, Muffin. 
<user0> Awe, that's a sweet story! The kitten got a happy ending!
<user0> That's great! Who did the travelling?
<user1> Wife. And she was 6 months pregnant to boot!
<user0> She must be a strong woman.
<user0> Oh no. I hope you got somewhere safe while it was going on.
<user1> Yes, it luckily passed our home, but you just never know!
<user0> That's good at least. Living in an area with tornados is so scary!
<user0> Oh that is fantastic! I bet your brother was pretty happy too.
<user1> Yeah, he gave her my grandmothers rings, since they were nice and we had them available. He's 23 so he's trying to save money, but still wanted her to have something nice.
<user0> That is very sweet. I think they will have a happy and lasting marriage.
<user0> That's exciting! What kind are you looking for?
<user1> I want a compact SUV, like maybe something like a Toyota RAV4
<user0> Ah. Hopefully something with good gas mileage!
<user0> OK ,have you done the need full?
<user1> Not really. Haven't even started. Got 3 months to go. Yikes!
<user0> OK get started already. A stich in time saves nine  !
<user0> Oh I think I can guess which retailer you're talking about. I've had so many problems with them over the years
<user1> Yeah, it's horrible. I mean, what's so difficult about shipping to Canada? You can pay for other people to ship the item to you from their address, you'd think it would be just as simple for a big company like that.
<user0> I know. Canada isn't even overseas in the literal sense, it's just over the border!
<user0> Unbelievable. You must be very angry with her (whoever she is).
<user1> It's been 7 years and I'm still not over it
<user0> Neither would I, I dislike such greedy people 
<user0> Wow that must have been frustrating.  I hope it didn't cost too much.
<user1> It did actually. Made me so mad. Now I have to save up again
<user0> I know how that is.  At least you have your car back!
<user0> I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds very rough. What happened to it?
<user1> Instead her stupid grandma moved in to it!
<user0> Oh jeez that's really awful. Can you get it back?
<user0> What didn't she like?
<user1> Well she had never done it before, so I thought it was special
<user0> Well that makes sense.
<user0> Congrats you have a baby on the way
<user1> Yes. It's a boy
<user0> How many kids do you want in total?
<user0> Oh no. How did you handle having two such big priorities come up?
<user1> I had to tell my boss I couldn't go and I was so stressed about that. It turned out the weather was bad and all flights go canceled so no one could go.
<user0> Oh, sorry to hear. I am sure your child was glad you were home. Is she or he feeling better now?
<user0> Sit where?
<user1> In the club
<user0> The club isn't a great place to find the right kind of girl anyways.  
<user0> What happened!
<user1> She knew what she was doing. I don't care how old she was. She knew
<user0> This somehow seems inappropriate.
<user0> What is your plan to accomplish that? 
<user1> Just to keep on working as much as I can everyday
<user0> Just don't over do, you have to enjoy being a parent, that's a key to happy kids.
<user0> Did you spill something?
<user1> Kinda. I thought it was a secret 
<user0> Was it liquid ?
<user0> What was brutal?
<user1> "i didnt shower for a few days and had an important meeting. I could tell that they could smell me. I became a tomato".
<user0> Really? No shower for few days?
<user1> yes. homeless for a bit
<user0> ok. I understand 
<user0> i would feel terrible to thats really bad, you should just tell her and change! 
<user1> it was a one time thing.. if i tell her that would break her
<user0> The truth can set us free, probably better for her and you both. 
<user0> Sorry to hear that... they say time heals everything but i disagree its been 9 years for me and it still feels like yesterday. How long for you? 
<user1> 5 years..
<user0> Im really sorry for your loss! I hope that someday it gets better for the both of us. 
<user0> Oh I love seeing kids achieve things! Adorable. Good for her! :) 
<user1> yeah.. me and my partner are so proud of her
<user0> I am sure, I would be too of my daughter. You sound like an awesome parent. 
<user0> oh.. well i understand. but that was a long time ago right?
<user1> yeah, but still.. that feeling never went away
<user0> come clean to them about any major lies, you'll feel better :)
<user0> haha.. i feel you. my mom feels the same way
<user1> well, i guess women are more detail oriented
<user0> Amen sister! women always keep things in check
<user0> thats really good of you. she is a lucky gal
<user1> yeah well.. this one time this model-like girl was so close to seducing me, i escaped from there right awat
<user0> haha.. i guess she was not as good as your girl huh?
<user0> Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. Are you considering getting a new dog?
<user1> yeah.. but its too soon i feel
<user0> I understand, mine just turned 15 and I'm not looking forward to that day.
<user0> Jeez people just always have to be in a hurry to get no where right. 
<user1> yeah.. i barely escaped!
<user0> people are just selfish and only consider their own lives! 
<user0> What was that?
<user1> soory it was mistakenly typed. 
<user0> It's okay.  
<user1> how was your day?
<user1> That is pretty cool! What made you want to become a lawyer?
<user0> I played a video game when I was younger, called Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney, and it made me want to become one!
<user1> Great! I know it can be a tough job, I am sure you will do fine, keep studying!
<user1> That sucks.
<user0> yeah that really sucks.
<user1> Well there are plenty more girls out there
<user1> Oh no. Did you leave?
<user0> I didn't. Luckily I had a spare pair of sweatpants in my trunk. I did end up looking rather odd with a suit jacket and sweatpants.
<user1> Like you had a different kind of accident lol
<user1> That sounds like you are excited for sure! When is he coming and what are yall going to do? 
<user0> He is coming next week! We are going to play Bingo at the local American Legion every night!
<user1> Honestly that sounds pretty fun to me I havent been to bingo in years. I love listening to the older people arguing when someone wins. 
<user1> yea i hear ya
<user0> Yes, and now my tummy has the rumblies. My workplace bathroom is a one-seater right next to my work crush's desk. I'm not sure if I'm gonna make it.
<user1> hope you feel better
<user1> it was fine. How about you?
<user0> yeah its an another good day
<user1> Nothing special...
<user0> oh how was the climate there/
<user1> Too hot for anything
<user1> how did it turn out
<user0> it was windy and the wind caught my shirt.  I was like "oops!
<user1> seems plausible
<user0> Yes.  Luckily people around me thought it was amusing and not offensive
<user0> as you should
<user1> yeah i do. i love her a lot
<user0> thats cool
<user1> what about you?
<user1> ohh good luck!
<user0> Thanks! It is my final exam for a summer class studying Database Design. I actually should be taking it right now.
<user1> thats cool
<user1> Oh thats great, what are the animals?
<user0> They have sloths, hippos, elephants, bears!
<user1> Oh wow, I love hippos and I don't know what sloth look like will let google help me out :)
<user1> That is terrible.
<user0> Yes it is. Do you think I should confront them?
<user1> Maybe? Is it that big of a deal to you?
<user1> Meaning you have been happier before or you are more happy now than you have been?
<user0> happier now beacuse i have been built a new house
<user1> Oh wow, that's great! I would be very happy too!
<user1> oh its hurts a little
<user0> I was able to cover most of it but luckily I had a little help covering the rest of what my kids needed. Even a little help is a big deal
<user1> wow thats great
<user1> Me too! Have you ever been to one of them races?
<user0> nope iam a street racer
<user1> Oh cool, do you live in the city?
<user1> That is awesome!  Is there a particular reason you are so happy?
<user0> because i built a new house
<user1> That is something to be happy about!  Congratulations!
<user1> That is an exciting purchase! What kind did you get?
<user0> audi q7
<user1> That is a nice car! I know you are enjoying that!
<user1> That was such a nice thing to do! She seems very caring!
<user0> She is! It was a watch that I had been wanting for a long time. I have used the same G-Shock watch for 6 years (which I love), but I wanted the upgraded version.
<user1> That is so nice that she made note that you had been wanting it for so long! 
<user1> That is SO exciting! I remember how that felt!
<user0> I am very excited about it! Although I am a bit nervous about what is to come. I still need to find a job.
<user1> That will come! The hardest part is over now!
<user1> I remember how that felt! I always hated having to wait for grades.
<user0> I have, too. I actually took two classes this summer. I took an online final exam about an hour ago, and I scored the grade that I was needing. The grade I am concerned about is a Strategic Management course that I also was taking. The professor was a bit of a stickler when it came to grading.
<user1> Awesome! Strategic Management sounds difficult by itself, I hope you get the grade you need!
<user1> That sounds awful. Are you going to see them again?
<user0> No, I do not think I should. This person doesn't make me happy.
<user1> It's probably best that you don't see them, then. Good thinking.
<user1> That must have been a difficult time for you.
<user0> The worst thing happened though. I wasn't able to see her for about a week because of not being allowed a bunch of time off
<user1> The company you work for is horrible. They should have gave you that time off because it was a family emergency.
<user1> Ew, that is not good! I wouldn't have been able to stay and eat.
<user0> I took about two bites from my plate and couldn't eat anymore. I will not be returning.
<user1> I do not blame you!
<user1> that is awesome, i feel the same when i drive by my grandparents old home
<user0> Yes, it definitely can be an emotional experience. Were/are you close with your grandparents?
<user1> yes i was
<user1> That is exciting! I love having pictures to look back on. 
<user0> Yes, definitely! It really made us all start talking about those and other memories, good times.
<user1> I love being able to reminisce on the past. Time goes by so fast. 
<user1> I had Hurricane Matthew come through where I live too! NE FL, I know how you feel, only I couldn't get gas for my car because there was no gas anywhere!
<user0> Oh, you poor thing! Thankfully, we'd gassed up and were good to go. The house survived too. Were you ok?
<user1> Yeah you thought ahead, me not so much. Our house was fine but a HUGE mess to clean up in the yard and no power for 2 days. I hope your house was ok too!
<user0> Ugh. We had to take the walls back to the studs, it was so bad inside. But thankfully we have wonderful friends, who accommodated us and helped with the clean-up!
<user0> Was it a checkup or did you have some health issue?
<user1> It started off as a checkup, but then they requested additional testing.
<user0> Did everything go well or do you not know yet?
<user0> Oh man, I bet that is fun
<user1> Yeah if only to be a kid again! Have you ever built a treehouse?
<user0> No, I have always wanted one though
<user0> Was it someone you know? Sorry for your loss if it was.
<user1> Unfortunately yes. It was my grandmother.
<user0> I'm sorry did you get to see her a lot before she passed?
<user0> Omg! That is terrible. They should really be considerate of people's time
<user1> I wouldn't have minded as much if he actually seemed to care.  If they make you wait and then spend alot of time with you that is one thing
<user0> Right. Did he at least apologize for the long wait
<user1> Oh no he acted like I was bothering him by taking up his time!  It was so annoying!
<user0> Wow! I would write a review, and choose another doctor who actually cares about his patient!
<user0> Good luck! What is it on?
<user1> Thank you! It is my final exam for a summer Database Applications/Design class that I am taking. 
<user0> How much studying did you do leading up to it?
<user0> Oh man, I bet that will be fun
<user1> We can't wait! Have you ever been to the ocean?
<user0> I have, I love going when I can
<user0> That's really nice of him! How long have you been married?
<user1> We have been married for 14 years.  Another reason it was so surprising was b/c he usually just takes me to dinner!
<user0> Well you made the right choice in man to marry lol. What kind of necklace?
<user1> It was one of those keys to your heart type.  Do you know what I mean?
<user0> That either sounds like a locket, or a heart shaped key. Am I close at all?
<user1> Yes the ones from Kay Jewelers that is a key with the heart at the top
<user0> Cool I think I saw a commercial for that actually.
<user0> Ut oh.. what happened?
<user1> I dropped my money while my hands were full, ran into the door, and the bag busted sending a 2 liter bouncing through the parking lot. And of course there were a lot of people that saw.
<user0> hehehe.. don't mind if I giggle do you?  You need to remember... don't feel embarrassed bout silly stuff like that.  Those people don't know you or really care.  They laugh like I did because its fun to see things happen to other people that we fear. 
<user0> What are you going to do about it
<user1> I'm going to take some time and I'll be looking at it with caution
<user0> Well be careful for sure
<user1> sure ... thanks
<user1> I am sorry to hear that. Have you ever talked to your parents about that?
<user0> I haven't. I'm scared that it would just make the situation worse. Do you think I should tell them how I feel?
<user1> Yes, you do.Otherwise, you are going to carry that pain the rest of your life.
<user1> That is great that your hard work has paid off.
<user0> Things have been slow at work and no one has gotten any raises lately, but mine finally came through at a good time!
<user1> Now you having something to celebrate. Congrats!
<user0> Thanks. And it's the weekend. Perfect timing.
<user0> Dont worry, anyone would have felt the same way. If it makes you feel better remember that we were all babies once.
<user1> I tried to think about that, but I was still aggravated. On the plus side, at least I was self aware that it was somewhat irrational.
<user0> Yeah thats important, did you have music you could have listened to or something?
<user0> Loyalty is a good thing
<user1> Yes, I think so as well. The new company offered me approximately $10,000 more a year than my current business is paying though.
<user0> Oh wow, that is loyalty for sure
<user0> I wish I had a grandma.. did she send you anything extra?
<user1> I can understand that. She is the only grandparent that I have left. She only sent a card, but she is living on a fixed income.
<user0> That is still really sweet.  I never knew any of mine.  Treasure her while you can!
<user0> Wow, must have been rather frightening. Glad you are ok!
<user1> Thank you! We were rather frightened, and we feel very fortunate. Tornadoes are quite the force of nature. No pun intended.
<user0> I hope you have all the emergency essentials you need for next time.
<user0> Gardening can be peaceful
<user1> Especially when you feel something special by nature
<user0> Nature is a wonderful thing
<user1> I hope this feeling increases
<user1> Oh how exciting!  What do you have planned?
<user0> We are going to eat tonight. Then tomorrow we are having a big surprise party with her best friend. I even had a couple of her friends fly into town that she hasnt seen in years.
<user1> I bet she is going to be so surprised!  Is she hard to surpise?
<user0> Yes she kind of is. I dont think she knows, but I can't really tell for sure.
<user1> Well I'm sure everything will go great!
<user1> yeah that's tough. But can you imagine how bad you might feel if he had a REALLY good time on the date and really thought things were going somewhere with the two of you?
<user0> Yes, I know thats what I was thinking.  I just don't know if I should have said the truth that I didn't like him that way instead of lying and saying I had a headache.
<user1> That is true. Either way it seems like he definitely got the hint. 
<user1> Oh wow, I have heard that can happen with that food
<user0> Yes, it was quite the uncomfortable experience. Now all of my coworkers have given me the nickname 'Diarrhea Joe'
<user1> Ha, that is funny
<user1> ewww! that is just super gross dude!
<user0> I know! The worst part is that I have irritable bowel syndrome, and I made the bathroom about twice as bad as it was initially!
<user1> Oh man that is just crazy! Feel bad for the person who has to clean it.
<user1> I would love to have that tv
<user0> Yes, I am torn between my desire to keep the TV and my guilt. What should I do?
<user1> Keep it, the guilt will go away
<user1> Women these days. I don't think i'll ever understand them.
<user0> Me either. If you would like to go to a specific place to eat just tell me. I'd rather do that than hear why you dont like the place we ended up.
<user1> Exactly, sometimes I think women like drama.
<user1> It must have been fun to catch up with them.
<user0> it was. We've spent a lot of time together and apart now, so it was good to catchup.
<user1> Well I hope you guys continue to stay in touch.
<user1> Going to college is a good thing, but taking classes in the summer can really stink. At least you'll get to graduate sooner.
<user0> Yes, exactly! My professor seemed to be a compulsive liar. For instance, two days ago he claimed that a local church used their 'personal fire department' (due to the large size of the church) to hose down protesters that were aggravated about the church's tax exemptions. Ludicrous!
<user1> That is the craziest thing I have ever heard.
<user1> That's awesome. What are you going to do about it?
<user0> Keep moving forwards with our plans and feel great!
<user1> I'm envious. Do you have any idea of what those plans are?
<user1> oh i know friends like those
<user0> I wish they did not suffer, because it is my suffering
<user1> i believe you
<user0> Thanks for your comprehension
<user0> Oh wow, sounds dangerous. Were you able to stay home and not venture out in it?
<user1> By the time we noticed how bad it was, we had to stay put. Our phones staying blaring telling us to seek shelter. We piled in the bathroom til it passed.
<user0> Did you have any damage to your home?
<user0> That's really sad. Is there a cure for Lupus?
<user1> No unfortunately there isn't.  You can sometimes go into remission with really powerful drugs but that isn't guaranteed
<user0> I am sorry about that. Is it contagious?
<user1> no it is an autoimmune disease
<user1> When did you get separated? By the way, that is terrible to hear.
<user0> one month I am desolate ... I hope to see the light at the end of the tunnel
<user1> Why are you so down, my depressed friend?
<user0> is that he loved her
<user0> Uh oh!  What did it end up coming from?
<user1> Went under the sink for something and when I moved it there was a puddle there. The sink had been leaking and the water was funky.
<user0> Yuck!  Clean that up quick so it doesn't grow mold!
<user0> I hate to hear that, what happened that made it end poorly?
<user1> We did not capitalize well on the short amount of time that we had together.
<user0> maybe you can plan another trip together soon - sounds like you guys need some time to reconnect and just truly enjoy each other.
<user0> I know the feeling.
<user1> You too, huh? How do you nicely ask someone to shut up? Yelling at that time of day just wouldn't be right.
<user0> Leave a note on their door. and at the end put "thanks in advance" lol
<user1> Nice idea, but I don't think subtlety is their strong point - they'd be liable to make even more noise, lol.
<user0> Well, you can at least try. 
<user1> I guess I could. Or I could just move. Still mad though!
<user0> You could get earplugs lol
<user0> Oh man! What happened to your hip?
<user1> I fell and fractured it two years ago. My then surgeon botched the operation and I have to use a walker to get around. If this new guy can do something I could walk properly again!
<user0> Oh my god..I had doctors really mess me up too. I am in a lawsuit. Have you thought about contacting an attorney?
<user1> From what I've read, unless it's a class-action lawsuit my chances are practically nil. The surgeon'll just lawyer up. What happened to you?
<user0> If it's medical malpractice actually you can get a good amount. Mine is still in talks, it's only been 6 months. Medical malpractice lawyers usually take you on for free if they like your case :) You can always try and you won't be charged if you don't win. It's pretty painless..people killed my child and almost me..
<user1> Oh dear lord. How unbearably dreadful! I hope that your lawyer takes that creep to the cleaners. Won't bring your baby back but will hopefully ensure he doesn't do it to someone else.
<user0> Thank you! I hear you..I didn't want to do it at first...but it's worth it for her..It's a few people I am suing.including midwives. If it prevents another childs death then its worth it! You should really look in too it, botched surgery and nerve pain can be horrible! I hope you get better!
<user0> Are you looking forward to the weather this weekend?
<user1> I am. It's not blazing hot so I plan on mowing the grass and getting some yardwork done.
<user0> Nice! Mowing the lawn isn't fun in the heat unless you're using a super fast one of course
<user0> I agree, the writing part is easy part, but the speaking part is the worst!
<user1> Yeah, it seems like the learning curve is impossible! Maybe I just need more life experience
<user0> Maybe so, they say to imagine the crowd naked, but I don't think that helps too much with the writing part.
<user1> True, a lot of people don't even have to think about what they're gonna say
<user1> Same. What are your favorites?
<user0> I've seen the movie Trolls probably 100 times, that and Harry Potter!
<user1> That's funny. I've also seen Trolls about 100 times. My daughter is now sick of it!
<user0> Yeah, sometimes there's more to those movies than you think, like they actually considered how adults would react
<user1> I've noticed a lot of the newer kids movies have adult jokes in them.
<user0> Yeah, maybe kids are just getting smarter with the internet and everything
<user1> Yeah maybe that... they are also lazier.
<user1> Yeah I get that. Where did you work?
<user0> Dairy Queen, it was the only restaurant in my town
<user1> Oh yum. Not a terrible place to work!
<user0> True, most of my friends worked there too so it wasn't too boring.
<user1> Yes , work is better with friends.
<user0> Yeah, so there wasn't too much of a pressure to work really hard, it wasn't too busy either
<user1> Really? I'm surprised the only restaurant in town wasn't busy.
<user1> Did you see that happen today?
<user0> Yeah, someone paid for this guy's groceries in the store without asking!
<user1> That's pretty cool.  What a nice person.
<user0> Yeah I think we should have more of that kind of thing
<user0> Whoa!  What were you driving that had no brakes?
<user1> I found a bike on the side of the road but didn't test it before coasting down this hill
<user0> That sounds quite scary!  Did everything turn out OK?
<user1> Yeah, usually I don't trust myself with those kinds of things, but I decided to go for it, rolled on some grass to lose a little speed
<user1> Haha!  Awkward.  What did you do?  Did you hurry up and get out of there?
<user0> Yeah, I'm not good with confrontations
<user1> Same here.  I would rather just leave the situation.
<user0> I don't think I've ever regretted not saying anything, but sometimes I can say the wrong thing or it just comes out wrong
<user0> That's great.
<user1> Usually at the end of the day it's never anything nice when my supervisor wants to talk to me but she broke the news and I was surprised!  Been walking on sunshine all weekend!
<user0> Congrats. I want a promotion at my job.
<user1> How long have you been there?
<user0> three years.
<user1> I'm sure you've done some good work - would it be hard to talk to someone and make your case?
<user0> I think I'm just going to move on.
<user0> Oh wow! What are you going to buy with all that sweet loot? Firecrackers?
<user1> Not sure yet.  I know some of it has to go for groceries, but the rest - I should save it, my burned out laptop needs a new hard drive.
<user0> That sound like a wise decision. I think I would just get a blow up doll instead.
<user1> If I had dispensible funds like that, there'd definitely be an anime pillow with a handsome guy on it, but alas, priorites.  *lol*
<user1> Cool. Does that get a bonus?
<user0> I got a gift card to a restaurant locally for my family.  That's a good enough bonus for me - the four of us tend to put a dent in the menu when we go out!  *chuckle*
<user1> That's awesome. 
<user0> I'm just happy to be recognized, especially since most times I just see myself as a 'cog in the wheel'.
<user1> Well now you know you're pretty great at your job.
<user0> I just do the best I can - that's all anyone really expects.
<user0> Was he upset?
<user1> He kinda gave me the "Mom, really?" look but I told him that we'd ride to the store in the morning b/c I looked around the kitchen and realized there was other stuff I forgot.  *chuckle*
<user0> I hate when that happens. 
<user1> I do, too.  I tend to get 'mom brain' at the worst times!  I'll be happy when he is old enough to get his own chips [he's 10 now].
<user0> I hate ggrocery shopping period. Too many decisions
<user1> It's easier with a list but still, you always remember the one thing off of the list and then it turns into TEN things off of the list.  XD
<user0> You are so right.
<user0> Did you go back?
<user1> No, I didn't.  We live in a rural area and the grocery store is 20 minutes away.  Lucky for him, I forgot some other stuff for tomorrow's dinner [mom brain!] and I told him that we could ride together tomorrow back to the store.
<user0> Maybe you should let him get a couple of things to make up for it.
<user1> Multiple bags of chips, to be sure!  *chuckle*  
<user0> Or you can get a variety pack!
<user1> Those are a lifesaver - he's in Scouts and he's starting soccer soon.  Those 24 packs are the best!
<user1> That's nice. I could get that here.
<user0> I was nervous about talking to her because I hate having to disappoint her - she's related to me.  So I didn't think she'd be as cool about it as she was.
<user1> Well now you know.
<user0> Yeah, I think that's where the anxiety was - the not knowing.
<user0> Noice!  What was it about?
<user1> I had to explain global warming to my son's Boy Scout troop.
<user0> Very cool, are you a scientist?
<user1> Nope, just a mom.  I had to do some research on the internet and it was a real eye-opener for me.  I believe in global warming but a lot of the facts on both sides of the argument surprised even me.
<user1> Oh no! That's awful.  Or maybe a good thing if he wasn't good for you.  How are you feeling?
<user0> Well, I'm hanging in there.  This is the first weekend we've not been together and outside of being online, the quiet is kinda loud.
<user1> I bet.  It can be brutal with the change and not having someone but you have to trust yourself that you are doing the right thing.  Its a good time to grieve your time together and then move on and find yourself again.
<user0> Yeah.  It's a positive that we broke up, I'm just looking for healthy ways to deal with the energy that's left.
<user0> Congratulations!  That is amazing!  You must be a hard worker.  What do you do?
<user1> I help manage distribution for a large company in my city.  Really I just hold a clipboard and crunch lots of numbers.  LOL
<user0> That's an important job though!  You're keeping things running smoothly for that business to thrive.  I'm so happy for you.  Money is tight for me so when I hear someone getting a bonus...it just makes me so happy for them to get that added chunk of money!
<user1> This is my first bonus in 10 years.  After feeling like a cog in the wheel, it's nice that someone noticed my hard work!
<user1> I wish I could relate. I'm a male, so I'll never know the pain and/or the reward that comes with growing a human being inside your body. It's such an impressive thing to go through, and no matter what, mothers will never get enough credit. You deserve serious props. What ages are they now?
<user0> 15 and 19! It hasn't always been blissful, as any relationship's journey can attest to! But still a blessing. And maybe one day you'll be a dad...?
<user1> Yeah, I'll consider it. That's a nice thought. My brothers have had 5 kids between them, so I have plenty of nieces and nephews to deal with in the meantime, and they've given me lots of practice, but I'm grateful for that. 15 and 19, that's awesome. You're almost all the way through getting both of them to a stage where your job becomes a little easier.
<user0> Ah, make the most of your nieces + nephews! You get to be the fun/cool/understanding uncle -- someone maybe a little more objective to turn to (depending on age!)
<user0> It what?  Its way higher?  If that's what you meant to finish with then I totally feel you.  Especially during the summer with the air conditioning running so much.  
<user1> Yes, that's exactly what I was trying to say haha hit enter too early. I thought we had lowered the electric use but boy was I wrong!
<user0> It is ridiculous.  I found out how they measure power that people use in their houses and it doesn't even sound fair to me.  It averages things because it can't specifically tell. 
<user0> Wow, school is right around the corner
<user1> It is! We actually got everything they need and more, except for a few notebooks. 
<user0> Well that should relieve some stress
<user0> Everyone has those kinds of days, it happens
<user1> It does but I'm sure the people at the busy store thought I was drunk. I ran into everything, shelves, displays and even the door when I was leaving. 
<user0> I am sure they have forgotten about it
<user0> Why not? What was wrong?
<user1> I studied really hard all night infact but when my results came, i had nothing to show for it".
<user0> Aww I'm sorry. That's a bummer.
<user1> it is indeed. wont happen again though
<user1> It sounds very motivational.
<user0> it was. i always questioned how he got the position but it makes sense now
<user1> He must be a great speaker.
<user1> What are you saving for?
<user0> Baby is due in less than 3 months
<user1> I am sure everything will be fine. Do not stress.
<user1> I hope you did well on it.
<user0> 5 months to find out !
<user1> Just hope for the best and don't worry.
<user1> That's great!  I'm happy for you.
<user0> thanks. now onto bigger things
<user1> What are those things?
<user0> starting a clinic
<user0> That sounds so exciting! Congratulations!
<user1> thanks. i think its an achivement of the whole town
<user0> It sounds like you live in a great community.
<user0> Oh man. Hopefully things are different now and you have the confidence that you need!
<user1> Oh yes. It all changed when I directed what was inside towards the gym
<user0> Nothing like taking it out on the weights and gaining the muscles in return! 
<user0> I understand that. I am the same way.
<user1> Especially when it comes to food. Like breakfast. I eat the same thing daily.
<user0> I cannot function if I eat anything other than my usual breakfast.
<user0> Unfortunately, I have very little discipline. I'm probably too addicted to carbs to get fit very quickly. 
<user1> I eat plenty of carbs. It's all about timing
<user0> How so?
<user0> wow. When that happened?
<user1> Last week. we're in temporary housing now
<user0> Sorry to hear that. I hope your insurer will call you back soon.
<user0> It is unacceptable. I hope he did not get cold as a result of this
<user1> I don't know what happened to that kid to be honest.
<user0> That is pretty sad and heart-breaking to see kids in such situations
<user0> Do you have plans to get together? 
<user1> Yes she took me out to a restaurant and presented me with a book I had been wanting.
<user0> How nice of her. You must have been so happy to see her.
<user0> There are usually many ways, but it depends on what you want to do!
<user1> I just want to work from home
<user0> Well, we all want to work from home but it takes a lot of work and sweat to make that a reality for most of us
<user0> That is so exciting.  what have you done to prepare
<user1> You know, not much to be honest. Just a few clothes and things. Need the buggy asap
<user0> the buggy is important,  I have a baby boy of my own.
<user0> Do you have a baby one the way?
<user1> I sure do. A baby boy. Less than 3 months to go now but it's hard saving up money. Just had a major car repair. It has set me way back
<user0> do you make enough money to support the baby?
<user0> oof that is rough.
<user1> Yeah. I put her through hell that school year. Made up all sorts of rumors 
<user0> those foids deserve it.
<user0> Yes, you only hurt yourself when you get angry.
<user1> I shouldn't have forced the issue and so I promised never to ask again
<user0> Give it some time, maybe she'll change her mind.
<user0> thats so sweet of you
<user1> She was having such a blast she went downhill and toppled over.  She took it like a champ but I was scared.
<user0> oh yea i can imagine glad shes fine
<user0> Wow. Do you expect to win?
<user1> I do! I am so motivated to win and I believe I am one of the fastest at my school.
<user0> That is nice. Good luck.
<user0> Nice, me too, are you playing Nintendo games?
<user1> Yes and also Sega Genesis. We play these on the xbox one though via emulation
<user0> I remember these game well, like Contra and Battle Toads. 
<user0> Was it your first time riding on one? Is there something in particular that makes you afraid?
<user1> No but I hate going in objects that travel fast, I really did not want to go on it.
<user0> Was it your only choice to get where you were going?
<user0> Great, what make are getting?
<user1> I'm not sure yet. Maybe a Toyota
<user0> Toyota is reliable, are getting an SUV?
<user0> Interesting choice. Did she like it?
<user1> She loved it.  She's 17, I was 18 when it came out and I would watch it all the time with my friends back then.
<user0> That's good to have something in common. Make the memories.
<user0> So what is the problem exactly?
<user1> I just feel kinda stuck in life
<user0> Try doing something you never did before.
<user0> It is disgusting. What did you do?
<user1> I told the waited and demanded a refund! It was gross.
<user0> You did good. You should have called the manager to tell him know.
<user0> There are so many bike trails available now. You are going to have a lot of fun.
<user1> I hope so, my new bike has so many gears. Such an upgrade from my last one! I can't wait to take it out.
<user0> I'm glad you were able to get one that you are going to enjoy so much.
<user0> That's a big step. I hope it works out for you.
<user1> A huge step. But I'm done with renting and I have a lot of renovating plans in the works.
<user0> I like renovation projects. And yes, renting is a waste of money
<user0> I feel you, I'm in the same boat.  Are you in a two income household?
<user1> Unfortunately no. It's very hard on me because I have to be disciplined with spending. Makes life very boring
<user0> Yep, money spent on bills and food, with little left for fun.  My wife has the same complaint. 
<user0> Oh no, that sounds horrible
<user1> Yep, she's pretty far gone now.  I now have to consider putting her down.
<user0> I am sorry, that is a sad thing to go through
<user0> Why would you not get paid?
<user1> I can no longer prove I did the assignment.  Computer work is for the birds sometimes.
<user0> I can imagine it is
<user0> Oh my, did it make you emotional?
<user1> Not visibly.  It was a picture from their wedding day and it brought a smile to my face to see them so young.
<user0> Aw hopefully you never lose that picture!
<user0> Oh what was the surprise?! 
<user1> Just a little spending cash.  Nothing outrageous, but enough to take the wife out and have a good time with.
<user0> You should go on a little date if you can. or to the movies!
<user0> You should have taken a Uber. You never know what will happen these days.
<user1> I agree. It was a bit foolish on my part and I don't want to risk myself nor be worried again. Thanks for the advice.
<user0> No problem. Its also worth carrying a taser or pepper spray.
<user0> did you pay him back?
<user1> No, I was going to but he said if he every found out I stole it, it wouldn't matter if I paid it back.  So I kept silent, its been 17 years now.
<user0> thats good thetn
<user0> Oh my, so close! But you can try better next time.
<user1> I agree, I should of studied harder too. Practice makes perfect!
<user0> Yes and theres no point mulling over it! 
<user0> wow thats crazy.. what ended up happening!
<user1> I managed to get away after a few smart quick turns, but I was shaking and in fear at the end of the chase. It was wild.
<user0> wow thats good
<user0> aww.. that must have been a sweet nostaligia. did you had a collection of those?
<user1> I used to collect so many when I was younger, it was such an awesome feeling to see them again!
<user0> I feel happy for ya! I used to collect cards myself, i still have them
<user0> That is great! Did you manage to land the job?
<user1> Yeah actually, i am still working on it. So much fun!
<user0> I'm glad to hear that! As long as you keep working hard and trying your best you can do it! 
<user0> Are you talking about the city or a person?
<user1> Neither, i am talking about the broadway show :D
<user0> I didn't know this broadway show but it seems nice.
<user0> Yeah, I love going to the beach as well! You must have felt so happy there in that moment!
<user1> I most certainly did.. There is something about looking at the calm and glory of the ocean.
<user0> I feel happy and content just sitting here listening to you describe the experience.
<user0> oooh no that's awful 
<user1> I know, I am disgusted at myself for doing it. I just wanted to pass.
<user0> ok but did you pass the test
<user0> That sound amazing.  Dancing is very bonding.
<user1> We haven't been able to go out in quite a long time.  Family and life stuff just gets in the way sometimes.
<user0> Well, a night out dancing will go a long way towards reconnecting with the love of your life.  I am happy for you!
<user0> im sorry to hear that.. what happened?
<user1> She got run by a truck.. I felt guilty and blue
<user0> oh.. wow.. sorry that it happened.
<user0> Oh sorry, did he pass away?
<user1> Yeah.. he did. He had cancer.
<user0> Oh my god.. my hearty condolences. 
<user0> That is really cool . Did you have a good time?
<user1> I sure did! the ocean and the breeze gives me such a sense of joy and calm
<user0> It feels so good just to hear you say that
<user0> Oh wow, the broadway show?
<user1> Yeah, the same. Lin Manuel is a genius to say the least!
<user0> Oh yea, he is too good at what he does. I heart stunning review for the show as well
<user0> how did it turn out
<user1> It was such a joyful experience. They always warm my heart
<user0> oh congrats on that.. always nice to see family 
<user0> did he catch you?
<user1> No i somehow managed to escape.. it was so scary
<user0> wow thats good
<user0> thats good
<user1> Yeah.. I always look out for her no matter what the problem is
<user0> as you should
<user0> I feel you, it would be really scary. How did it turn out?
<user1> It turned out well actually, we had a nice time
<user0> so happy for you!
<user0> Damn! was it a stray dog?
<user1> I think so.. it looked like that. I was shivering when i finally managed to escape
<user0> Dear god.. I hope you are alright my friend!
<user0> Oh really? I believe you wanted to be a singer yourself huh?
<user1> Yeah.. i did. i never got the chance to pursue that
<user0> Well, it is never too late my friend.. pursue your dreams :)
<user0> Did they follow your instructions, or did they do their own thing?
<user1> I figured they would just goof off.  However; when I returned all chores were comples.  I was pretty impressed.
<user0> Wow!  I didn't expect that answer from you!  That must have been a great surprise!
<user0> Oh god.. thats so gross
<user1> it was! i felt sick seeing that
<user0> I would have thrown up right then and there
<user0> i was beet red when I realized what had happened.
<user1> 5
<user0> Thank you, your so kind
<user1> 5
<user1> Is she staying with you ? 
<user0> No.  Thankfully it was just a visit.  She took us all to dinner, it was nice.
<user1> Sounds like everything went better than expected.
<user1> Oh dear me.. So sorry to hear that! what did you do?
<user0> I have not confronted them. I am still thinking over it.
<user1> I really hope things work out for you my friend
<user1> Disgusting. Was it the flying variety?
<user0> Yes, but this one didn't fly.  He just decided to go under the chair I was sitting in.
<user1> Gross.  We have those here too.  Typically you only see them during the summer.
<user1> good for you! that is how it is supposed to be
<user0> I am working hard to make sure I can cover them.  Hope fully this month of work is better than last month.
<user1> I wish you the very best on that my friend
<user1> i feel like is should be prepared
<user0> 5
<user0> oh sorry to hear that.. why didn't it work out?
<user1> I spent my first night out at a Whataburger, eating alone.
<user0> Aw.. i feel you my friend. Hopefully things get better soon enough
<user0> What did you lie about, and why?
<user1> I kissed a mutual friend of ours. I lied when she checked up on me. It was a one time thing, i did not wanted to hurt her.
<user0> Best advice.  Never confess it.
<user0> Damn! Every kid tells such innocent lies.. I bet your were embarassed
<user1> I was, so very much! I avoided my friends for a whole week thenafter
<user0> Aww.. Your story is both cute, funny and innocent
<user0> Did you give her one of each?
<user1> She jumped in my lap and peppered my cheek with kisses.  It was pretty cute.
<user0> aweeee that is pretty cute.
<user0> Shoot.. I bet it was scary.. How did you handle it?
<user1> Well, i lost a few pounds on the weeks leading upto it. But the actual meeting went well
<user0> So glad to hear that buddy. Wishing you are your girl all the very best
<user0> Have you been applying to try to get a position?
<user1> Unfortunately not.  In the end I ran out of money and had to leave that dream behind.
<user0> That's unfortunate.  What are you doing now?
<user0> Thankfully they just were checking up on my speed
<user1> I'm sorry? Are you still talking about the cops?
<user0> Sorry, something wrong with the chat interface
<user0> Sorry to hear that!
<user1> It is ok.. She passed away few months ago
<user1> Oh no.. Did he pass away?
<user0> No, but he did end up puking all over the parking lot afterwards.
<user1> Hope you feel better
<user1> Uhm.. yeah, sure. I concur!
<user0> I envy people who can dance really well
<user1> Oh yeah, me too. They have such cool attitude
<user1> holy cow! Thats terrifying. What did you do?
<user0> I stood there speechless for a moment, turned back and ran for my life!
<user1> Hahaha.. I am sorry, i know it was really scary, but to think about it now, it is really funny as well
<user1> Nice.. what type of ticket.. Monopoly?  Price is Right?  Scrabble?  Bingo?
<user0> It was Blackjack.  I didn't win anything though.
<user1> Better luck next time!  I love to scratch!
<user1> That sounds gross, did you get sick from it?
<user0> No I spit it out and listerined my mouth.
<user1> Smart move, at least you noticed it and it wasn't hidden under icing or anything
<user1> Oh god.. sorry.. How are you holding up?
<user0> I'm coping with it. So many memories with her
<user1> Sorry buddy.. hopefully she is at a better place
<user1> losing a loved one is never easy , especially a brother im sorry for your loss
<user0> thank you. I'm sure it will get easier with time. It was just so tragic, he was so young
<user1> I cant imagine the pain you went through, i have 7 brothers and the taught of losing one of them scares me
<user1> I hear ya. Both sides are infected with this issue. 
<user0> Very true! Why does news have to be so hyped up?
<user1> Well, they are looking for more viewers. It is not news anymore, it is entertainment.
<user1> That is nice. They are good at that age. I have a 20-year-old, and he is currently ignoring me.
<user0> I have an 18 year old doing the same.  What my 4 year old doesn't know is I giver her the sugar free version.
<user1> I understand that. I tried to give him a new table for his apartment, and he blatantly ignored me. I was like, well I don't have to give it to you.
<user1> That blows dude , i bet it was not your fault 
<user0> The company got bought by someone else and we all got laid off.  Lost my family home and all.  But things are slowly improving.
<user1> So they just cleaned house ? Damn that bad , i would assume they would have kept some workers 
<user1> I thought walmart was pretty cheap.  I've never been to aldi's
<user0> you should give it a try! They have their own brands which are super cheap and the quality is great
<user1> I may need to see if I have one near by.
<user1> I know right? everyone is, with Lebron James coming in
<user0> Hell yeah! i am sure we are going to perform really well this season
<user1> So true. Lakers going to do well this time around.
<user1> Oh god.. so sorry to hear that. May i ask how did it happen?
<user0> He had lung cancer..
<user1> Sorry.. Hopefully he is at a better place now.
<user1> Aww, such a nice boyfriend in this day and age! She is so lucky.
<user0> May be. But i have known her all my life, she would die before going behind my back
<user1> I assure you she is a keeper. Marry her buddy!
<user1> Good, I hope you make the ends meet
<user0> That's the plan, I've signed up for a bunch of double shifts.  Fingers crossed.
<user1> I wish you the best of luck, you will be fine!
<user1> Who is hamilton?
<user0> It is the broadway show, by Lin manuel miranda
<user1> Oh okay, did you see it in NYC?
<user1> That is good to hear.  I am sorry to hear she was hurt. What happened?
<user0> She fell down from the first floor..
<user1> Ouch.  What kind of dog?
<user1> I'm not a very good dancer.  What kind of dancing did you do?
<user0> mostly hip hop. We were travelling and battling with other teams. It was really fun
<user1> Oh wow, that does sound fun
<user1> Well, if you are willing to try steroids, then you might have a chance of winning. Without it, it is impossible to even participate
<user0> That's not true! I'm actually vegan and I don't make steroids and I looks pretty amazing. I don't need to use none to participate or win
<user1> Well in those contests, you have to be really pumped and by just fruits and vegetables, it is very unlikely
<user1> For work, when i got a new job
<user0> Oh alright then, feel good
<user0> I'm so sorry.  You have my deepest condolences. Its hard to not feel isolation with the death of someone you are close to.  I can tell you it does get better and you are not alone.  He lives on in you.
<user1> yeah.. i know.. memories still haunt though..
<user0> Take joy and pride in the memories you have of him.  They are your personal family movies in your mind.  Cherish them because not everyone gets them with their parents.  Its good to find support and counseling too if you need it. Take care of yourself.
<user0> Yeah, i know that feeling. how did you handle it?
<user1> I was really close to running away, but i somehow managed to pull it off
<user0> Good for you buddy :) happy for ya
<user0> Big houses are a pain in the neck to keep clean.
<user1> true, but there is so much space for her kid to run and play at and I live in a tiny apartment with my son
<user0> It does have its benefits.
<user0> damn, thats sick and rough.. He knew you guys were together?
<user1> Sort of, yes. He did it anyways. I yelled at him.
<user0> Can't say he did not deserve that..
<user0> That's wonderful!  I do too.  I don't take it for granted because I've been battling Lupus for 13 years and in bed a lot.  Its an amazing world we have! What is on of your favorite things to do outside?
<user1> I love to garden. Organic gardening, I plant peppers, cucumbers, tomatoes and a bunch of other goodies. 
<user0> Sounds wonderful!  I really want to take up gardening.  It would go with my new lifestyle I've adopted of eating plant based.  Do you have tips for a beginner?
<user1> Just get outside and started playing / digging  in the dirt, You will soon catch on to what works for you. 
<user1> The rap version?   Doesn't sound all that appealing to me.  Was it that good?
<user0> It was really awesome dude, the full show covers it all up
<user1> Maybe i'll have to check it out
<user1> how did that go
<user0> Awesome! She went down the big ramp today for the first time. It was so cool.
<user1> oh thats awesome.. congrats
<user1> Optimism is the faith that leads to achievement 
<user0> There is many paths leading to faith
<user1> for faith there is no path it is an individual human's thought 
<user0> It takes a path to find ones faith
<user0> I am not, I am still young
<user1> When you become one, you will never forget the day it happens. You'll weep of happiness.
<user0> I hope so, I am still not sure if I want kids
<user0> I have anxiety attacks too,  you feel like you cant catch your breath and you are light headed.
<user1> yes! And i felt like that for 3 days on and off!
<user0> that is crazy,  Its only usually a few minutes for me before I can talk myself down.
<user0> Don't worry. It will be okay. Flights are always safe
<user1> I found that out, after many sleepless nights. Now we fly all the time and I love it. I feel kind of silly.
<user0> Its natural. Do not sweat it.
<user0> That will be *such* a wonderful feeling when you do. I know it's hard when you see someone reach the "finish line" first -- are you able to turn that envy into inspiration?
<user1> I really am trying hard to- that's such a great suggestion. I know I'm making good progress to my goal, and I genuinely am pleased she did it!
<user0> See? That's terrific! And she's got to love that you can celebrate her victories too -- even more inspiration to support yours!
<user0> I'm like that too, so I can totally relate. Were you able to talk to him about how you felt?
<user1> Yes, but when we were younger -- he didn't really understand. And truly, it was more about my own insecurities than about him, you know? As I grew more into myself, the jealousy loosened its hold.
<user0> I've felt the same way. As I have aged and become more comfortable and secure in my marriage and in myself, those other insecurities and fears dropped off. Good for you for conquering that challenge!
<user0> Oh, that must be exciting! I bet you were busy making preparations.
<user1> I prepared for weeks. I could not wait for them to get here. It had been almost a whole year since I had seen them and they have a new baby.
<user0> That sounds like it was a lot to take in! Congrats to them!
<user0> wow.. what do you plan to do ?
<user1> I've helped me create a repayment plan where I have paid the loan payments and he can catch back up by paying me. I just really feel frustrated because he has the money, but he wastes it.
<user0> yea i can understand that
<user0> Oh really? How did it go?
<user1> I lost 7 pounds! I am SO thrilled because it was challenging to follow the plan all week long. 
<user0> Great job! I'm so happy for you! Losing weight is hard!
<user0> That sounds exciting! Congratulations to her. I bet there was a lot of celebration to be had for such an achievement!
<user1> Absolutely! Of course, now the real work begins ;-) But her *knowing* that it was her hard work paid off in such a gratifying way -- ah, so happy for her!
<user0> I bet! But at least now, like you said, she can see what hard work can achieve. Hopefully the path continues in the best way possible and she can get everything you both hope(d) for!
<user0> Did that person betrayed you in any way?
<user1> Well, in a sense. But to be fair, I may have had my own "vision" of who they were and held them to that standard -- not really seeing them for who they were. I have to accept some responsibility for that, you know?
<user0> Don't be so hard on yourself for being a frien and trust another people.
<user1> I've definitely worked through that! Happily, it hasn't affected my ability to trust -- just inspired me to be more truthful with myself and others ;-)
<user1> I love reuniting with old friends, helps me remember and appreciate the good times.
<user0> I agree. We went to high school and middle school together.
<user1> I bet that was a long time ago!
<user1> I'm sure you studied hard and should be proud of that! I'm positive you nailed it.
<user0> I was very excited with my result. I am very competitive. Sometimes I wish I were not so competitive.
<user1> Being competitive isn't a bad thing unless you let it get in the way of your personal life. 
<user0> You are completely right. It is very important to not lose sight of what is important in life.
<user0> How did you meet your friend?!
<user1> She was a very close college friend and now she lives a few hours south.
<user0> College and high school friends are always close to the heart. I'm glad she lives fairly close!
<user0> That is unfortunate. I hope that it is able to be treated well.
<user1> Thanks. I have to go to a Monitoring Unit in two weeks where they will induce seizures to see if they can pinpoint their location. Not going to be fun.
<user0> I hope it goes as smooth as possible. Hang in there.
<user1> Thanks again. I have lots of support so I am fortunate
<user1> Wait, were they leaving to go somewhere or like dying? Either one is a little sad to be honest.
<user0> I know -- I needed to just come out and say "when we had to put them down". Always age or illness related -- but man, SO tough.
<user1> It's like losing a family member :(
<user1> What happened to him? Are you guys roommates?
<user0> No, he is a friend that recently got fired and needs some help.
<user1> That is very bad. Unemployed individual can be very frustrating to deal with
<user1> How did they lose so much weight compared to you?
<user0> i guess they worked harder but
<user1> Maybe it has something to do with your diet ?
<user1> Getting out of town and way from all of everday life's struggles always sounds like a great time.  Did you leave you cell phone at home while you weer away to 'really' get away from everything for a minute?
<user0> Yes, sometimes I leave it away and that makes me appreciate everything else more.
<user1> That sounds like a really relaxing time, I'm jealous.
<user1> No refunds for a cancel 1 week before? That sounds like a total scam! I would be furious. Did you ever find a way to get your money back? Because that does not sound legal!
<user0> we are currently pursuing a case against them. they are a local travel company, so they dont know what they're in for
<user1> I hope that you win your money back and then some, you really deserve it after all of that upset!
<user1> Lovely.  What did you do together?
<user0> We went to the beach and had some fun in the sun and also ate dinner with some other mutual friends.
<user1> Sounds like a great time.  What has brought that memory back up again>
<user1> That must feel lonely.  You should go out and try to meet some people!
<user0> I think that's a great idea. I will try to go out this weekend.
<user1> Good deal!  Hopefully then you won't feel so alone!
<user1> That is frightening! especially if you didn't know whether it was a harmful spider or not! What did you do?
<user0> I stopped the car and got out and ushered it out of the car.
<user1> Oh, so you were able to get that spider away from you! Good job, hopefully that won't have to happen to you again!
<user1> Wait, summers already over? Next summer?
<user0> Summer is not over until Labor Day! We still have the whole month of August!!
<user1> Oh really? I thought summer ended after July. You learn something new everyday lol
<user0> Summer can be over in July for teachers sometimes. Are you a teacher?
<user0> You should get a mini fridge and put it in your room, with a lock on it.
<user1> I think that's a great idea. I know where to get those fridges for cheap.
<user0> Yea man go for it, don't procrastinate.
<user0> Wow, that truly is devastating. I wish your family can make it through these hard times :(
<user1> My parents health has deteriorated rapidly, and they refuse to go get counseling. It's very sad for me to see.
<user0> If my sister died to breast cancer, I would be so depressed to the point of my health deteriorating too. :(
<user1> It's why I think getting a counselor is so important. No one should be expected to go through this on their own.
<user1> Amen to that.Life is so unfair it's not even funny.
<user0> Life is not fair, but it is also amazing in that we are here to begin with
<user1> Life is so complex.We had no idea of the design of that
<user1> What is the state and do you like change?
<user0> We've been great with change, including a few overseas moves under our belts. But this is to Anchorage! I've read a lot, and there's a lot to be excited about -- but man, those looooong winters!
<user1> Oh that is all the way into the cold and wet wild! Do you have or will you think of getting sled dogs?
<user0> Ha! Not likely in the city....but hey...who knows! I WILL use the opportunity to finally learn how to cross country ski.
<user1> lol, right. You will have great fun!
<user1> I agree!  Things look really good going forward.
<user0> Hopefully prosperity will carry over into the next few generations.
<user1> I hope so as well, especially for my kids sake!
<user1> Im sorry to hear that , i hope she can find a way stop this before she spirals out of control
<user0> I have been trying to get my family and her friends to have an intervention, but they have not agreed to it. She really needs one.
<user1> She really does need an intervention , and family and friends would help greatly , i hope she can get her life back together 
<user1> Oh my god, that's excellent! Congrats!
<user0> Oh, that was nearly 20 years ago ;-) But I'll always remember that Chicago day, Halloween, visiting the Shedd Aquarium with friends.
<user1> Oh, lol. Did you get to see any sharks at the aquarium?
<user0> The thing I most remember were the beluga whales. So beautiful, in their own weird way -- and a baby beluga had just been born. It seemed provident!
<user1> Oh cool, yes that is very interesting. So how big were those whales in feet and the baby too?
<user1> I know how you feel! What did you watch?
<user0> I ended up watching The Ring! It was ridiculousness.
<user1> It is a pretty good horror.
<user1> That is very impressive. She going to make sooo much money
<user0> She worked so hard and it's really expensive so I hope so!
<user1> Any employer would hire someone who went to Harvard in a heartbeat. You are a lucky parent!
<user1> Nice what kind of car is it they purchased?
<user0> They ended up getting a Honda Prelude.
<user1> Ok that is a nice car what color is it?? 
<user1> That is excellent, what did you major in?
<user0> I majored in environmental engineering!
<user1> Oh cool. Do you want to work as a scientist?
<user1> Sorry to hear about that.  I wonder if there's any way to fix this situation.  What do you plan to do?
<user0> I plan on coming clean at some point, but I'm not sure how to break the news.
<user1> Coming clean is a great way to start.  It's hard since you know she'll be hurt.  Were you having trouble in the relationship before?
<user1> When is the last time you seen them?
<user0> I saw them last summer which seems so long ago. I am very excited to see them because I am very close to them.
<user1> That's awesome I hope yall have a good time!
<user1> Do you still talk with any of your older friends?
<user0> Yes, I talk with several of them. I wish I had time to keep up with and talk to more though.
<user1> Do you have little time from working or other things?
<user1> Yikes what was it about?
<user0> A young girl would come out of the TV if you watched a video.
<user1> creepy.  Were you able to fall asleep after watching it?
<user1> That's great. I bet it is a very special place for you two.
<user0> Yes, it is a very private Bed and Breakfast and we try to go back as often as we can.
<user1> Sounds like a nice little place. I am glad you two have that spot to share.
<user1> at least Riley passed in their sleep. Hopefully they didn't suffer. i'm sorry you lost a loved one.
<user0> Thank you.  She was my constant companion.  I loved her so much
<user1> i have a big doofy mutt who is a 75 lb lap dog in his heart. i know the feeling
<user1> I absolutely agree. I really hope he doesn't win in 2020.
<user0> We shall see. I truly believe that he has done some much damage to our country in so many different ways.
<user1> He's like an angry child trying to make everything about himself!
<user1> Dang, that sucks. MAybe they can visit you instead?
<user0> Yeah, hopefully so.  It isn't healing correctly is the problem or else I would just go in my cast.
<user1> Ah, gotcha. Well I hope you heal fast!
<user1> I guess you don't live in Alabama? Was it overall a good trip....or challenging? Or both!
<user0> No, I do not live in Alabama. We drove and trip was overall very good as sometimes it can be challenging when driving such a long distance
<user1> Well, if the drive was the most challenging it sounds like a good trip! Too often it's family dynamics that are *more* challenging -- and not so easily taken care of. ;-)
<user1> That is the worst!! I know that you must have been very frustrated with your teammate.
<user0> Yep. Especially when you feel that you get dinged for the overall project. And at the same time, you don't want to complain about it, because it makes *you* look bad!
<user1> There have been a number of times where this has happened to me too. I hope that doesn't happen to you too much in the future!! :)
<user1> I hate bees and wasps so much. Maybe you should call pest control?
<user0> I will be able to take control of it myself as I have done so in the past. It still makes it difficult because I can not mow the grass until it gets taken care of.
<user1> That sucks, I hope you get it figured out!
<user1> wow, it must have been quite an experience
<user0> It was enough to wake me, but not the cat, lol. It just made me realize that the Big One could happen any time and I would have been up the proverbial creek!
<user1> My prayers are with you buddy. Stay safe
<user0> Thank you, I will. It's just the price you pay to live in Paradise, right! At least now I won't die of thirst.
<user0> Awesome. What breed did you own?
<user1> A paint (Black and white) and a red quarter horse 
<user0> I love paints, and growing up we had 2 quarter horses that my dad used for calf roping.
<user1> Horses are hard work but the fun is equal to the work. 
<user1> 10 minutes is a good time to be able to change a tire. I do not think I could change a tire own my own. 
<user0> I've had so many flats in my life I've gotten quick at changing them.
<user1> Practice makes perfect, or makes you fast in your case.
<user1> I would be too! Did you to it?
<user0> Yeah, I ended up doing it. I jumped in and missed a rock wall by probably 2 feet. My legs went numb from the cold as soon as I landed.
<user1> So did you regret doing it? Or were you super proud that you did? 
<user1> You must be so proud!
<user0> I am, but it's so gorgeous and it's a fantastic golf course. And I'm stuck here, bored stupid! I know, I'm being selfish.
<user1> I don't think you're being selfish, you're doing your best!
<user0> I'm trying. Thank you for making me feel better - I really do wish him great success and happiness.
<user0> What state are you going to move to?
<user1> Potentially Alaska -- Anchorage, to be specific. We've lived in different places before -- Amsterdam, Zurich, and Hong Kong. And even though it's a US state, it feels foreign somehow!
<user0> Oh that is nice, will you be going skiing?
<user0> Who doesn't..  everyone should do it!  Have you ever had any mystic experiences while you did it?
<user1> No mystic events. I just feel really relaxed and happy. 
<user0> I hear you can travel to different dimensions while meditating..
<user1> My traveling is more like a sleep / trance, or hypnosis 
<user1> It must have being terrifying!
<user0> Yes, I was truly frightened. It ended up being okay though. It was actually just a roofer inspecting my roof that nobody told me about.
<user1> Tnank god! They should have let you know they where going to do the job.
<user1> That's terrible. People need to learn to commit to their promises.
<user0> Especially when it's based on emotion versus honoring a commitment. And when they know it has a very real economic impact.
<user1> I don't understand how so many people value emotion over logic and reason!
<user1> oh, that is nerve wracking. What did you try to do to cope?
<user0> Honestly, I took a xanax beforehand. It was a group presentation also which helped take some of the spotlight off of me.
<user1> Better living through chemistry! I'm glad you made it through.
<user1> That is really nice of him.  Did the other people get mad because they had to wait?
<user0> Not at all. They were super nice, and just kept getting together what they wanted to buy. I love living here - such nice people.
<user1> Lucky you.  Where I live people are not so nice.  Can I move there?
<user0> Sure! There's plenty of room, lol. Just be sure you like hot, steamy summers and lots of golf fanatics!
<user1> I am in Central FL... so uhh.
<user0> I get your point - used to live in NE Florida myself. Well, this farmer fella is going to get lots of business from me, that's for sure.
<user0> Ouch, I would try and wear something on your neck next time you go in there.
<user1> Next time I will get stung somewhere besides my neck
<user0> Hmm, wear something thick and long. Maybe hockey pads!
<user1> Maybe I should bring a can of wasp spray!
<user1> Ut oh.. what happened?
<user0> Luckily, they were customers that we knew really well and they had a mailbox at our store. So they brought it back when we explained what happened. I felt awful though.
<user1> But at least you lucked out and they brought it back!
<user1> Ah, I know what you mean! And remember *yearning* to be older?! (And of course the adults in *our* lives were shaking their heads, thinking the way we are now ;-))
<user0> Yes! I wished so much that I would be an adult so I could make my own decisions. Now I wish I could have someone else make those decisions for me! haha
<user1> As long as you keep your playful spirit, you're in good shape! Sometimes it takes work to hold that awareness, but I can see it in you!
<user1> It's awesome to have a job where you feel rewarded through what you do. What do you do?
<user0> I work as a facilitator and team trainer -- mostly with a company who I truly love and respect for walking their talk.
<user1> That sounds like a lot of fun, it's so rewarding to have a position where you can engage with other people. You really seem motivating and inspiring, so I'm happy you have that job!
<user1> What did you do after waiting for 2 hours?
<user0> I bought a pint of beer and a curry and joined another single woman at a table. We had a fine time, but I sure am wondering about my friendship!
<user1> Silver linings do happen, maybe is was a good thing your friend forgot about you.
<user0> Could be. I just feel he was being rather inconsiderate, which is not something I'd expect of him.
<user1> Maybe not a true friend after all.
<user0> Kind of what I was thinking. I won't be arranging to meet him again for a while, that's for sure!
<user0> I bet. How much did she win and did she offer to share?!
<user1> She won $5,000 and never offered to share. 
<user0> That's a lot of money, to me anyway. Perhaps she's got a lot of debt to pay off, or perhaps she has kids to take care of?
<user0> Good job! You must have worked hard and prepared. Or are you just naturally really smart?
<user1> I wouldn't say naturally smart, it took a good amount of planning to do well. We established a study group about 2 weeks before the test which helped alot.
<user0> Well done! You should be proud.
<user0> If I'm understanding you correctly, they're going to clean it up, right?
<user1> Clean up, stabilize from future collapses, demolish vacant houses open closed roads, and so on
<user0> Wow, that's fantastic news indeed! How long has it been derelict?
<user0> What did they or the person do to you?
<user1> Well, I'm in a wheelchair, so can't move too quickly. I just sat looking at them, trying to figure out whether I could reach the broom at the corner of the porch.
<user0> Broom would be a good choice, hit them in the crotch, that will stop them.
<user1> Well, that would have been an option. The person came right up to my porch and said "Good morning. Can't sleep either?" It was my friend and neighbor walking her dog and I didn't recognize her with all her winter gear on. Scared the daylights out of me!
<user1> That's sweet. I'm sure she will adjust in time. Have you ever personally had to make a move like your daughter did?
<user0> Actually, I did! I moved across the world to Doha, Qatar to teach for a couple of years. Even though my husband and daughter was with me, it was very hard to be away. Have you ever moved far away?
<user1> No, I never have. I've always lived in my state I was born in. However, I did travel to Utah which was about 1200 miles away and got a bit homesick so I can relate.
<user1> Oh no! I hate speaking in front of crowds. What happened?
<user0> There was a lot of stuttering and red-face going on. Also, technical difficulties.
<user1> I know you probably feel like you did a bad job- but I bet you did so much better than you think! Be proud of yourself for having the nerve to speak in front of others!
<user1> Honking is a way to communicate. In some countries they honk just to let another driver they are there.
<user0> Exactly, I think a lot of people are too cautious while driving, which makes things even less safe 
<user1> Going too slow can be just as dangerous as going too fast. Especially in the fast lane!
<user1> That awesome! Congratulations! You should be very proud of yourself!
<user0> I was very excited when I found out. Have you ever been accepted to anything that you really wanted before?
<user1> Yes, I have! It's a great feeling when all of your hard work pays off! Best of luck to you!
<user1> There is a big storm coming where I am living now. Did your power go out?
<user0> Fortunately, it didn't, but there was a LOT of thunder and lightning. I think a lot of places are being hit by storms right now. Please stay safe!
<user1> Oh I will. Also wanted to let you know that if your power does go out to be aware that this is when they come out to play!
<user1> I know!  I was just watching his show on Netflix!  So sad, especially since he had a little girl he is leaving behind.
<user0> Indeed. Depression is a terrible disease and there simply aren't enough resources devoted to mental illness, imo.
<user1> I agree.  He had so much to live for.  I guess it is hard to know what demons people are hiding inside.
<user0> It is. I read his book Kitchen Confidential. He's been battling addiction and demons all his life. I thought he'd found peace, but I guess not.
<user0> That is good. Did you have a good time with your supervisor?
<user1> I had a great time keeping my job and not being fired! I was on the ball for his visit.
<user0> Good job! Maybe you will get a promotion too!
<user0> Which way are you feeling? Are you a thrill seeker?
<user1> I am indeed. I am ready to go and ride all of the rides, roller coasters especially! Do you have a favorite theme park?
<user0> Yeah I really like Six Flags. They have some great roller coasters. Have fun tomorrow!
<user0> Keep it up. Soon you'll have enough money to buy a new house.
<user1> That may take awhile, but for the moment I have a nice emergency fund and am prepared for whatever may come my way.
<user0> Exactly, it feels great when your prepared for the unexpected.
<user0> That's fun. Will anybody be dressing as Santa?
<user1> Haha! Nobody ever dresses as Santa, but the kids still believe in Santa which is very fun.
<user0> Maybe you could pay someone to come into your house as Santa! And all the kiddies will be amazed!
<user0> that happened to me one. i had an american bulldog that had seperation anxiety and tore up my sofa cushions once. it was like a fluffy murder scene when i got home.
<user1> That's horrible, but looking back in the future it will be funny hopefully. My dog I thought had been trained, but she clearly had not!
<user0> oh no. right now you are going crazy but it will be funny like you said in the future.
<user0> What types of tv shows do you like to watch?
<user1> Everything really, I just know I'm going to cry if it's sad even if I've seen it before.
<user0> Do you keep the tissue close whenever your are on the tv?
<user1> Nah, I don't get to to bad.
<user1> Ive been to Busch Gardens before.  They have some really cool Roller coasters.  I hope you have a great time.
<user0> I do too. Did you go to the one in Williamsburg or in Tampa? 
<user1> Ive been to the one in Tampa.  They have this new coaster that rotates forward and backward and spins around. It was equal parts fun and scary.
<user1> Yea, I agree. Or they just really don't care.
<user0> This kid dropped his candy bar and then picked it up and ate it.
<user1> Did he even hesitate?
<user0> Not even a little.
<user1> What a little monster!
<user1> Dogs are the best. are they ok?  what kind of medicine do you have to give them?
<user0> Well, right now they both have an ear infection. Both of them are Golden Retrievers and they both are very gentle dogs that let me administer medicine without any problems
<user1> Awww golden retrievers are adorable.  My ex had one of them.  Well I hope your dogs feel better soon.  Ear infections are no fun at all.
<user1> That's intense! I hope the damage wasn't all that bad.
<user0> It was very bad. The entire roof will definitely have to be replaced.
<user1> Yes, get it fixed as soon as possible. Does insurance cover it?
<user0> Yes, insurance will cover it thankfully. I am very lucky.
<user0> Wow, you remember your friends from grade school? Maybe if I saw them again those memories would come back.
<user1> Yes I do. Some of them I am still very fond of.
<user0> Well, I hope you had a really great time. It sounds like you probably did!
<user0> That sounds like fun, do you have a big family?
<user1> No, I really don't so it's special. I would have what many would call a nuclear family, you know?
<user0> Yes I understand, I have a big family so it's hard for us to all get together at the same time.
<user0> Ive never been to one of those.  Is she really young or is she like a professional dancer?
<user1> She is very young, and she stole the show. She was hilarious and stood out from all of the rest of the girls.
<user0> thats awesome.  I wish I would have taken dancing lessons when I was younger.  Im a horrible dancer
<user1> You know you could still do it. I know you can.
<user0> yea you're right.  Maybe ill look into some classes and give it a shot
<user0> Aw, that's so nice of him! Does he live far away?
<user1> He lives about a couple hours away, but he's young and always busy. I was very relieved to have some help as it was a BIG job!
<user0> That's a great son. It's always nice to be able to rely on people close to you to help out when needed
<user0> Yeah I have had that experience. One was so bad I left before getting another job. Don't recommend doing that, lol.
<user1> It is so tempting you're absolutely right. I'm going to try and hang on though, and thanks for the advice.
<user0> Stick it out until you have a backup. Your bank account will thank you!
<user0> Gross. It would have gone straight into the trash here.
<user1> Yes, it went straight to the outside trash container. I was very surprised that my entire refrigerator didn't smell bad.
<user0> You can use baking soda to get the smell out of it.
<user1> Thanks for that information. I'll try it out.
<user1> That sounds wonderful! What type of store is it?
<user0> It has a lot of quirky things that most Big Box stores don't carry. It has everything from clothes for all ages, to jewelry and lots of other things.
<user1> I love that! It must be so much fun to curate the types of things that go in to the store. Do you help out or work there?
<user0> I have another job so I can't do too much, but I love going in to see her. 
<user1> I'm sure she *loves* having both your presence and your support!
<user1> Wow, I can't imagine how you felt living in Hong Kong. That would take some serious adapting.
<user0> It did! But there was a very vibrant and concentrated expat community -- that helped immediately!
<user1> I am so happy that you found that expat community. I have often thought about moving abroad, and I'm glad that you adapted well.
<user0> Do it! It gives such a wonderful perspective on the world. We've lived in Amsterdam and Zurich as well....and may very well move to Anchorage soon!
<user1> I think I might. It sound exciting, and I thank you for the encouragement.
<user1> That's unfortunate, but I'm happy that you have a good support network to help you out.
<user0>  Not a day goes by where I'm not thankful. I'm still recovering and they are still there for me.
<user1> I hope you recover well and I'm sure you will with good support by your side.
<user1> I completely understand that. Did something like that happen recently? 
<user0> We're living with it. And it's dividing us as a society. I truly hope that the upcoming months will bring big change. Definitely working for that!
<user1> Yes, I know how you feel. All we can do is encourage friends to join us in helping to make a difference. I believe there is hope!
<user0> Me too! <fist bump> ;-)
<user0> Wow, that's a good amount of time. Is he usually so secretive?
<user1> He is usually a very private person. He hasn't dated anyone in the over 3 years i've lived here, and he's only ever had one friend over.
<user0> Ah, maybe he just wanted to make sure it was going to work before he told anyone. 
<user0> It should be harder to get a license than it is.
<user1> I agree! Do people just not care about risking their own lives never mind anyone else?
<user0> It's as if some people think they are the only one's on the road.
<user0> Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry. May I ask how long ago it was that she passed? 
<user1> She passed two days after Christmas. She was very sick during the whole month of December.
<user0> They probably still just need some time. My grandfather still isn't over the passing of my grandmother and that was over a year ago. I would just make sure to keep seeing and talking to your parents to make them feel as loved as you can.
<user1> I will, and thank you so much for the encouragement.
<user1> Please don't ever give up. I would definitely work harder to find a job by networking with friends that have jobs in different places.
<user0> Well I don't have any friends that are in my field or even close to it. I'm trying the best I can and am trying to find other ways to make money too. 
<user1> Go ahead and post your resume on as many job related forums that you can. I think it's great that you're trying to find other ways of making money too. You are a go-getter, and don't ever give up!!
<user1> That is awesome. Do you know what she wants to study?
<user0> She told me she wants to become a dentist, but she's a little fickle. I will see what she says she wants to do in a year. 
<user1> As long as it is something she enjoys. I am sure you are very proud of her!
<user1> it has been really busy even for me at work , i feel your pain
<user0> So much for relaxing during the summer?
<user1> I know right ? unfortunately for us those are the perks of growing up lol
<user1> Oh I don't think I could do that. I have a fear of falling from high places. 
<user0> It gave me the biggest rush that's for sure. But on the way down I was saying my prayers.
<user1> I think I would pass out from fear lol.
<user0> You should do it sometime. It's fun to take chances.
<user1> I think the chances I take should be directly proportionate to the consequences of the actions.
<user1> That is interesting. Do you miss meat or dairy at all?
<user0> I had to start eating this way because of health reasons and I have found some amazing recipes on Pinterest.   It makes me not miss meat or dairy at all
<user1> That is good to hear. I wish you the best of luck with your new diet.
<user1> I have to trust my doc completely that he has steady hands and will inject the nerve correctly.
<user0> oh man that sounds like serious stuff ,and it sounds really scary as well hope everything goes great
<user0> That's terrible to hear. Were you eventually able to be there?
<user1> I was and she was had a full recovery. 
<user0> That's great news. I don't know what I would do if my mom passed.
<user1> Me neither, my mom means so much to me. 
<user0> Me too. I'm glad everytihng worked out in the end for you.
<user1> Do you get to see your mom often?
<user0> Not very often. She lives about 7 hours away driving time.
<user0> Those cars are pretty slick, what color was it?
<user1> It was blue with white racing stripes. 
<user0> Wow, one day I hope to have enough money for a car like that, that's awesome
<user1> Same here, they are pretty expensive. 
<user1> UGH my dog has destroyed all of my favorite shoes.
<user0> This is the first one she tore up. My roommate was watching her while I was out of town. I'm sorry about your shoes.
<user1> I dont really like dogs for that reason.  They are fun to pet but taking care of them is a chore.
<user1> That sounds like you have a great wife.  What did she make you?
<user0> She made me ribs and a cheesecake for dessert. 
<user1> Yummy, You are making me hungry.  Happy belated birthday!
<user0> Thank you! What is your favorite meal?
<user1> I always love pizza!
<user0> Me too, do you have a favorite flavor?
<user0> when that happened to me i watched a lot of movies , for some reason the sad movies made me cry, but just be strong and patient one day you realize you can do better or find someone new
<user1> I know, it's just so frustrating after spending so long building your lives together. 
<user0> it happens to the best of us, and i totally understand where your coming from , spend some time with your friends or loved ones 
<user0> What did he cook that is such an exciting way to spend your day with your papa.
<user1> He made us a pot roast with carrots and potatoes. It's melt in your mouth good.
<user0> That sounds so delicious I would have loved a plate of that food any deserts 
<user0> Congratulations! Sounds like you're ready for the new position.
<user1> Thank you, I am so excited. It has taken 3 years of hard work to earn this promotion.
<user0> What is your work area?
<user1> I work in the military 
<user1> That is so exciting! Such a fun time in life to watch them discover new things and always be such a surprise with what you didn't know that they already knew! ha ha, that's a tongue twister.
<user0> Yes, thank you! Having children is a wonderfull blessing. Couldn't imagine my life without my daughter. Do you have children?
<user1> I do!  An 8 year old daughter and 5 year old son.  They are my life as well so I totally get what you're saying.  How old is your daughter?
<user1> Where are you going
<user0> I'm going to Japan. I'm so excited, I've never been.
<user1> Oh wow, I hope you have fun
<user1> Happy Birthday!!!!  Did you have a nice time?
<user0> Thanks! I had an awesome time. I went to a sushi place and it was delicious.
<user1> I love sushi.  Did you get a spicy Tuna Roll?
<user0> I did indeed. Along with every other kind of roll that they had, haha.
<user1> Sounds good.  You have some generous parents.
<user1> Very nice, wind in your hair, exercise, and fresh air.  Did you have a good time?
<user0> It was wonderful. I felt at peace as I rode by all of the flower gardens and fountains. Do you visit any parks or gardens in your area?
<user1> I am actually home bound, but I love to live through other peoples experiences.  My wife and kids go out and bring back stories of their adventures.  I love it!
<user1> I know how you feel.  I moved away from my family and friends this summer.  Do you have family nearby at all? I often feel lonely when I'm watching a movie by myself but then I remind myself that I'm loved by a lot of people.
<user0> That is a great attitude to have, my husband is in the military so he is gone a lot to other countries. My family is about 2,000 miles away in Alaska!
<user1> You are so strong!  Please thank your husband for his service and thank you for being his support, no matter the miles between you.  Take care of yourself and get out with friends when you can!
<user1> You sound like you're embracing life!
<user0> Ah -- thank you! Definitely aware of wanting to live life to its fullest. We've recently gone through a tough time, so it feels lovely to focus on adventure again.
<user1> Where did you move to?  I feel you. I am in the same place.  Just reversed 13 years of Lupus suffering by going plant based and now I want to live and see the world! I would love to move to Italy.
<user0> Bless you! What a *relief* and how impressive! We've lived in Amsterdam, Hong Kong and Zurich -- Alaska may be next. (And Italy is awesome, by the way!)
<user0> Oh wow, I'd be really jealous of him.
<user1> I certainly am! Of course, I can't be certain yet because I don't know what he's getting. My car is junk though so it's bound to be better.
<user0> Well, hopefully you can get yourself a better car soon.
<user0> That is nice.
<user1> Yes indeed! I am very happy about it. Do you have any younger siblings?
<user0> I have one younger brother but he is old enough to drive on his own,
<user0> Its always nice to catch up
<user1> Yes it is. I am glad that I was able to speak with her.
<user0> I hope you keep doing thaty
<user0> Same here. I actually moved to the other side of the USA, and I do miss my home
<user1> Are you able to visit often? That helps -- but it's funny how things never feel *exactly* the same, you know?
<user0> Not as often as I would like. Air travel is expensive after all. I know exactly what you mean though!
<user0> Were you happy about that, or creeped out?
<user1> I respectfully told her I was not interested, I already have a wife so I need to be committed. I would never cheat.
<user0> You're a good guy. Did she take it well?
<user0> That's really awesome that you supported your friend!
<user1> I am very glad that I went and supported him.
<user0> I'm sure he really appreciated you support too!
<user0> Aw, I'm sorry. I know this isn't the best solution, but have you considered listening to funny podcasts?
<user1> No I haven't, but that's a decent idea that I may try. Thanks for the suggestion!
<user0> No problem! I know you can't always fix everything, but it's worth trying wierd ideas every now and then
<user0> Oh wow, I love that kind of sauce
<user1> Me too! It only took 10 minutes to make and now I feel way more sure of myself when making it next time.
<user0> That isnt long at all
<user0> It is always good to keep our skills up to date. We never know. It could also help for a promotion also.
<user1> Indeed. I feel that it is very important to stay caught up on the latest developments. And the potential for a raise isn't a bad motivator either.
<user0> I hope you get your promotion.
<user0> Oh man, your life is about to get so much more hectic. I feel for you. When my first was born, I was just as pumped, full of naivety and positivity. I felt like I could take on anything coming my way. I was exhausted after two weeks. It's such a long ride until they're able to even remotely look after themselves.
<user1> I know! Hopefully the stress levels are kept to a minimal and I have a very supporting husband who will be there every step of the way. I hope for a swift and trouble free birth.
<user0> I know you have a lot of work ahead of you, but I'm sure it will be a rewarding feeling that will be unmatched for the rest of your life. As a man, I can't imagine what you'll have to go through, or what you will enjoy, but I really commend all women everywhere for the strength they give when having a child.
<user0> Did it scare you?
<user1> Yes, I had kind of an eerie and generally unsettling feeling. I wondered why I did that in the first place. Can you relate?
<user0> Yes, a little bit. When I was young, I didn't like that much scary movies.
<user0> Whats your favorite team?
<user1> In NFL it's the Packers and college is Alabama
<user0> Well for me, in the NFL I like the Cowboys and college its Alabama too.
<user0> That's pretty cool. I bet it's pretty difficult to do something like that.
<user1> I agree, years of experience and a lot of guts are needed. You could easily get injured but he pulled it off. It was crazy to see it in person. It's the type of stuff you see on TV
<user0> I'd love to watch people do tricks like this in person myself, but I'm not sure if there's any locations near me.
<user0> Aw I am sorry that happened to you. I hope the repair didn't cost you too much! 
<user1> It was just the carburetor, which is supposed to be an easy fix. I'm so glad I wasn't stranded at my office.
<user0> Ah I see. Something similar happened to my brother too recently while he was picking me up, so we were stuck at a coffee shop parking lot for several hours. 
<user0> Well at least you put in the effort. What grade did you end up receiving on this test?
<user1> I ended up getting an A actually. It was exactly what I wanted to get.
<user0> That's great! Hard work pays off I guess.
<user0> Oh I'm sorry.  How are his family doing?
<user1> They've been really closed up about the whole thing, I can't contact them or anything. They must be going through a tough time, I could not imagine.
<user0> It's pretty hard to deal with.  One of my friend's buddies died in a car crash as well.
<user0> Woah, that is huge news. How are you handling the news.
<user1> I am still in awe, I think things will turn out fine but it was definitely not expected.
<user0> I am happy to hear that you will be ok. Enjoy having no kids while you can!
<user0> That does not sound fun. What did you do to prepare. 
<user1> I had an emergency generator, extra food and first aid kits at the ready. I did not want my family in danger.
<user0> That is very smart thinking!
<user0> How old were you? If you were a kid, that deserves a pass!
<user1> I was 17, at that age I should of known better.
<user0> You live and you learn, at least it was a petty crime and nothing serious!
<user0> That's sweet of you, the flu is a pretty gnarly sickness to go through. You sound like a good friend!
<user1> Aw thank you. He seems to be recovering pretty well, just whiny. 
<user0> That's good, at least he is getting better, he'll survive!
<user0> There's nothing wrong with that
<user1> I'm just happy that I got it, it took a lot of hard work.
<user0> You should celebrate too. I would
<user0> That is always disappointing. Did you have a good time with your friends anyway?
<user1> Yeah, it was fun.  We ended up making the best of it, making fun of the movie while it was on.
<user0> Sounds like you guys know how to have fun no matter what. You have good friends. 
<user0> I too feel the same. What did happen at last?
<user1> The interview went well and I ended up getting the job, so I guess I worried for nothing :)
<user0> Yeah, very good to hear! congrats!
<user0> Eww, I hate neighbors that have no class.
<user1> She usually cares enough to at least time her cigarettes so they don't get in the way with things like work, but not this time.
<user0> Maybe you should start a petition in the neighborhood to kick her out.
<user0> How awful! Please tell me you can laugh a little about it now?
<user1> Now I can laugh, but when I was on the floor I was not laughing, I just wanted to leave.
<user0> Embarrassing things happen to all of us!
<user0> Amazing! I wish I could see a pic of it!
<user1> He is still very messy but he really enjoys eating like a big boy
<user0> Oh he will be, but enjoy it, only babies once
<user0> that's a pretty long date! Where did you guys go?
<user1> Lunch, a zoo, my apartment for a while, and a movie and dinner.  We just didn't want to go home for the night :P
<user0> That sounds like a fun day! My wife and i used to go to movies a lot!
<user0> That's terrible.  Was he already very sick?
<user1> Yeah, he had diabetes for a few years by that point.  It was just a rough way to go and I hope it didn't take very long.
<user0> Im sorry he went through that.
<user0> Those were the days right. I loved those paychecks no bills.... can we go back to that? 
<user1> Oh man the thing that got me was waiting for the first check to come in though. Remember that? You're very FIRST one
<user0> Yeah and I bet it was like a whole 100 or 200 bucks and we were probably feeling like a ceo. 
<user0> How does that make you feel? Is that a dealbreaker
<user1> Oh god no thankfully I have fond memories of it. I just realized how cheap the company is! 
<user0> Ah, I guess you have to save money somewhere
<user0> Oh no I am sorry to hear about that, were you together long?
<user1> Yeah we where together for about 2 years but im getting over it now
<user0> That's good make yourself available and open for others and you will find the next relationship
<user0> That is embarassing, but a good story at least!
<user1> Yeah, it certainly lead to a lot of good natured ribbing from my parents :P
<user0> That is for sure, you can always count on parents for that
<user0> IT does go fast. I was just changing my daughters diaper and now she is in junior high!
<user1> I know, that's about how I felt too! I think back to when he was much smaller and how adorable he was when he would call me mommy then!
<user0> I miss being called mommy. One day you'll be called grandma
<user0> that is embarassing, but were you at least okay?
<user1> I scuffed my knees a bit, but I was okay. I was also with a person that I really liked, so that made it even worse. But, I jumped up super quick lol
<user0> Well maybe they found that endearing in a way!
<user0> How old were you when you did it?
<user1> maybe like 19, but i felt bad after so i invited them to dinner
<user0> That was nice to repay them back with dinner
<user1> Yeah i told them as well
<user1> i'm sorry to hear that. i know exactly what you are going through. My brother tragically passed away 2.5 years ago. He was only 32
<user0> Yes, I'm sure you can relate as well. Ironically, that was the same age that my sister passed away. She took her own life, which my mother and I found her, and it was very hard for us all. But, I couldn't burden my parents with my pain, I felt.
<user1> I know how hard it was for you. My parents and my brother lived in a different country so i couldn't even go there at that time to be with them. I felt heartbroken and alone
<user1> To thank whom?
<user0> to life God to that higher energy
<user1> Is that who got you the job?
<user0> Nobody ... that's why I'm grateful
<user1> What job do you have?
<user0> I'm an administrative assistant for a construction company
<user1> Are you in a union?
<user1> did you find it ?
<user0> I did but it took a while 
<user1> well thats good
<user1> how old did you turn ?
<user0> I turned 34
<user1> congrats
<user1> When will you be able to visit?
<user0> actually in 2 weeks! I'm so excited about it. I'm going there with my son! They've never met him
<user1> Oh boy, that must be amazing for him
<user1> what did you end up watching instead
<user0> I ended up watching Impractical Jokers
<user1> thats cool
<user1> Oh yeah, that's always nice. Sometimes they just don't get it, though.
<user0> Fortunately it's usually just not having the best answer for what they ask. I've learned and prepared a lot more this time.
<user1> Wow, you sound pretty confident! You must really know what you're talking about.
<user0> I tend to know a thing or two on occasion.
<user0> I am afraid to fly too.
<user1> I usually do pretty good on short flights. Longer ones make me a little nervous.
<user0> I know right, planes make me nervous.
<user1> I hate turbulence too.
<user1> Uh oh. I bet she wasn't happy when she found out.
<user0> No she wasnt. In all fairness it was a group of people I never would have thought she would have wanted to hang out with.
<user1> Yeah, I can understand that.... But it probably would have been best to invite her anyway, just in case.
<user0> you are right. Guess I know better for next time.
<user0> that is awesome. sundays are usually my veg out days.
<user1> I wish I could more often, but it rarely happens. Especially during the summer. My yard grows like literal weeds.
<user0> mine is going crazy with mosquitos
<user1> ouch! I would not have had a relaxing sunday if my yard was that way.
<user0> i tried to trim my tomato leaves yesterday but i got bit up so bad i ran back inside
<user0> What does your husband do for work?
<user1> He is an iron worker, so he has to go state to state at times to build very large buildings. 
<user0> My uncle use to be an iron worker, so I know exactly what you are talking about.
<user0> That is VERY understandable. Emotional affair is still a betrayal. 
<user1> Well, we really didn't know her very well and she actually just came to one of our friends house while we were there, and she was intoxicated. He was trying to help her get up and situated, but he was very insistent about it, even when she didn't want help. It looked bad to others.
<user0> Well it's nice he is kind but yes that is a little strange. Women can usually take that as something and try to get with your man. 
<user0> What is her best talent?
<user1> Art, she was accepted into a special program for high school.
<user0> Does she draw or paint? How any students are in this program?
<user1> Mostly drawing. And she's in advanced level classes in most subjects.
<user1> That is terrible.  I don't know why teenage boys can be so mean.  What did you end up doing?
<user0> I actually knew his father, so I called and spoke to him about it. I let him know that if it happened again, I couldn't promise her big brother wouldn't take it in his own hands to defend her, as he wasn't okay with anyone bullying her.
<user1> That's good that she has a big brother that can defend her against the bigger kids.  It is just terrible that a teenage boy would act that way to a 10 year old.  No excuse for that.  I hope you don't have to deal with it again, though.
<user1> I'm sorry, what is his job?
<user0> Retail, but he's working nights at a store really far away and it sucks
<user1> Hopefully they will give him a better shift.
<user0> We are hoping with in a few months.
<user0> Hey that's awesome!!!  What are you planning to buy with it?
<user1> Well, we have college tuition, just got back from an expensive beach vacation, etc. So, if anything replenish some savings, right!
<user0> That's an awesome, very adult thing to do!  Congrats!
<user0> I don't like them either. It makes me sick.
<user1> Yes, I was just flipping through the channels and happened upon a man cutting his own leg off. yuck!
<user0> Oh my gosh! That is disgusting!
<user0> What does your husband do for a job?
<user1> My husband usually gets a substantial bonus this time of the year, but there's no guarantee. It's difficult waiting, and not knowing!
<user0> You already told me that. Is he in sales or something similar?
<user1> He is a welder and iron worker, so he works very hard all year long and does extensive amounts of travel. He has earned it!
<user1> that is no good! you need someone to be there and take care of you.
<user0> Luckily, my children still live at home, but it's not quite the same. Plus, it won't be too long before they are ready to move out
<user1> I have never been married, so i cant imagine,  but I would want to be with my spouse every moment of every day.
<user1> It is so hard and so rewarding to see them grow up. 
<user0> Yes, it really is bittersweet. But, the older they get, the easier it is to think back to the younger days!
<user1> I bet.  I really want to hold on to mine forever, but I know that they need to grow up.  I hope you are still able to make memories with yours even as they are getting older.
<user1> That is pretty scary. Did you find out where it came from?
<user0> No, i felt it would be better if i dont go looking for it. i managed to get the hell out of there
<user1> Smart move. You don't want to get involved in a gunfight. Glad you made it out safely.
<user1> So sorry to hear that.. May i ask how did it happen?
<user0> He had terminal stage brain cancer.. we did all we could, but..
<user1> How sad.. Feel better knowing that he is in a better place now buddy
<user1> Wow. Congratulations! Is your new job near home?
<user1> Oh, that's awful. What did you do? I would've dumped her and beat that dude's face in.
<user0> i have not confronted them. still thinking about it
<user1> Well, I gave you the solution right there, buckaroo. All ya gotta do is execute.
<user1> Oh nice. did you have a good time?
<user0> yeah. so much memories of me and family spending time in beach came to me
<user1> Aww, that is really sweet to hear
<user1> I don't have a normal job anymore but that would frustrate me as well.
<user0> Yeah. i outperform this person, and he started throwing shade on me out of pure jealousy
<user1> What a disgusting person. I'm just being honest.
<user1> Oh the broadway musical? I heard really good reviews of it
<user0> It was such a stunning show. Lin manuel should get a grammy for this
<user1> Oh yeah, he is such a true genius of our times, he deserves it
<user1> Oh.. Were you sick?
<user0> Yeah, i felt like i was coming down with something. i rushed to get a cab, but i couldn't help it
<user1> Don't feel bad about it buddy, this happens to all of us sometime. Feel better
<user1> Oh dang. How do you think that is going to go down?
<user0> I am not sure to be honest. i am feeling so nervous about it
<user1> I'm sure everything will be fine. Just gotta be yourself!
<user1> Oh no.. That should have sucked for you. what did you do?
<user0> Nothing. She was drunk, so i let it go. I still feel disappointed
<user1> As you should. It will pass away, dont worry
<user1> I'm so sorry but what a joyous occasion. 
<user0> She lives in another state and wasn't due for several more months. Everyone is fine now though, so it has turned out to be very joyous.
<user1> So happy for you. Is this your first grandchild?
<user1> That sounds like a great place to propose! How did it go?
<user0> They started playing one of our special songs and the next think I knew he was down on one knee. I said yes, of course!
<user1> That's so heartwarming! I hope your relationship works out very well!
<user1> That is nice to have a friendly boss.
<user0> He is not just friendly, he is a good leader and knows how to treat his workers.
<user1> I envy you. That is cool.
<user1> Really?
<user0> The fireflies would blink in the jar all night long. 
<user1> Yes I did that too
<user1> This happened to me also.
<user0> I hate it! I feel more energized when I get 4 hours of sleep than I do when I get 8!
<user1> Did you try to exercise?
<user1> That is so exciting!! buying a house can be such a great experience.
<user0> I'm definitely excited. The house just now got built and I saw it for the first time last Monday. 
<user1> Oh so it is brand new.  I bet you cant wait to move in.
<user1> Really?
<user0> Unfortunately she was unable to make it because her diabetes is wreking her health.
<user1> So sorry about that
<user1> I know how you feel. I'm working right now :(
<user0> She doesn't understand why I always have so many other things to do, but she would literally play 24/7 if I had the time.
<user1> Can you blame her?   I mean, if i didn't have bills that's what I'd be doing.
<user1> Isn't that the best!  My 3 year old the same thing!  I couldn't be happier or more proud!
<user0> I was really surpised.  I expected a stick figure, but she drew a lot of features including my beard and mustache.
<user1> She may be a natural artist!
<user1> I see.. did they complete them?
<user0> When I returned I found them playing video games, the math work was not even attempted.  I tunred their stuff off and we did it together.
<user1> Well, we were kids once too.. We can understand their point of view as well. Glad you got to spend quality time with them though
<user1> Thats really cool! i hope you get one very soon buddy
<user0> Me too. I've been dying to get out of my current job, but having a recruiter makes me feel at ease.
<user1> Yeah, i can understand how that can be frustrating. Dont worry, things will fall in its place soon enough
<user1> awh memories, what were they of? 
<user0> A lot of them where photos of my sister and I when we were toddlers.  It was a good trip down memory lane.
<user1> so cute, i love those memories i bet it was beautiful. 
<user1> Why did he leave you?
<user0> I'm not sure. I guess he just didn't want anything to do with me.
<user1> That's awful and there has to be another reason for it. I can't stand fathers who behave that way, despicable. 
<user1> Congratulations on getting an interview.  Good job in prepping for it, I'm sure you'll do well.
<user0> I don't normally prepare for interviews, but I really want this job, so I put in a lot of practice.
<user1> What kind of job is it?
<user1> Oh! Was the ice cream cake for you?
<user0> It turned out to not even be an ice cream cake.  It was some kind of pinapple cake.  I still had a piece but it was disappointing.
<user1> Awww that is kind of disappointing. Ice cream cake sounds tastier than pineapple cake.
<user1> Oh im so sorry to hear that.. how long were you married?
<user0> We were married for 10 years
<user1> It must have felt unbelievably hurtful for you.. I hope you find someone very soon..
<user1> I can understand that. I don't get nearly as many birthday wishes as I used to. I guess it happens as we get older.
<user0> Yeah that's very true. Doesn't mean we aren't important though
<user1> I agree. I think they think we don't care about our birthday so they don't care either. But they are wrong.
<user1> Oh! I am so happy for you. Congratulations. What was the job?
<user0> A lab manager for a Physics department at a University.
<user1> That sounds very interesting. I'm sure you will do great. 
<user1> What happened??
<user0> As I was sitting on the toilet I kept hearing a scratching noise.  When I turned to look a huge waterbug had climbed up the tub wall next to me.
<user1> Holy moly! That would have scared me too! Did you kill it?
<user1> That is understandable.  Such an experience can be tramatic.  Did you eventually learn?
<user0> I did learn, but it took a long time to overcome my fear. I'm glad I eventually did!
<user1> My wife had a similar experience, she still doesn't drive.  Good for you for overcoming it.
<user1> That sounds miserable!  Did you do it yourself?
<user0> Yeah.  It wasn't terribly hard, but it definitely took watching a few videos to feel confident.
<user1> At least you saved money doing it yourself!
<user1> Oh wow! that stinks. Im sorry
<user0> It's ok.  I'm basically over it now, but it was really angering then.
<user1> I bet it was. At least its over now 
<user1> I bet.  I was the same way.  How did you guys meet?
<user0> We met at a store
<user1> Nice.  That's a relatively unique way to meet.  What store?
<user1> I would be furious.  What did you do?
<user0> Well, ranted about it to my girlfriend for a while then talked to the professor to make it clear what she did.
<user1> What was the outcome?  Did the professor believe you?
<user1> That's awesome!  What kind of house is it?
<user0> IIt is an older home in need of some repairs.  We can't wait to get started on renovations.
<user1> That's gonna be a lot of fun, but a lot of work.  Good luck!
<user1> that is exciting! what kind of car?
<user0> It was a mustang. I saved up enough money and purchased it outright
<user1> wow, that is impressive. i've always liked mustangs. what color?
<user1> I've had pets to do that too.
<user0> It came out of nowhere. I almost fell out of bed!
<user1> Well, I guess it really loves you.
<user1> I bet! Im sorry you are feeling down.
<user0> Yeah, we would take a bottle of wine with us, watch the surfers and just kick back. Wish those days would return.
<user1> Times like that would be so awesome! I hope they come back for you
<user0> Maybe one day. That was when I lived in Northern California - the best place on the planet, imho!
<user0> A spelling bee - what fun! I'm sure you will win - I bet you've worked hard toward your goal.
<user1> I have. I've studied for 3 week now
<user0> That's a lot of studying. Well, the best of luck to you, though I know you won't need it after all that hard work!
<user0> How is it going?
<user1> It's been a challenge.  Yesterday she got on the toilet herself though.  She said she didn't want to be a baby anymore.
<user0> Thats one way to get them. being a "big girl" is such an accomplishment
<user0> Do you guys get to talk a lot?
<user1> Yeah, we talk by text all the time and call every day.  It's still hard though, we haven't been apart longer than a couple days since we met.
<user0> Getting through it can only make your relationshipi stronger though
<user0> Im sorry to hear that.
<user1> Its ok. It's just been rough without him. I miss him
<user0> Was he sick before?
<user0> You must be really excited!
<user1> I am!  We've never been apart this long, so it's been tough.
<user0> Are you planning something special when she comes home?
<user0> I am sorry to hear that, they frighten me as well.
<user1> Some have pop ups and they are creepy
<user0> Yes, those scare me to death when they come out of nowhere.
<user0> Great, where will you be going?
<user1> I'm taking a cruise to Alaska. I'm soooo excited.
<user0> Well, that will be fantastic. Hope you have a good time.
<user0> Cool beans. Where was she?
<user1> Germany for a language course.
<user0> Did you get to visit? Germany is quite beautiful.
<user0> Where is it gonna be at?
<user1> It's going to be at my house. We are going to have a lot of food
<user0> Is someone important coming voer?
<user0> which one was it
<user1> It was Scream
<user0> it wasn't that scary to me
<user0> Aww. Thats nnice
<user1> Yeah! It gave me all of the feels. I read through them and pretty much fell in love with her all over again.
<user0> No one writes letters anymore... its kind of sad
<user0> That would definitely creep me out.
<user1> Yeah.  I kept thinking trees were people or things standing out in the woods.
<user0> I have done that before lol
<user0> i bet she's a wonderful woman
<user1>  She really is
<user0> hold on to her
<user0> oh no is it completely destroyed not salvagable ?
<user1> no not salvagable. i had to buy a new one. 
<user0> so sorry to hear about this disaster
<user1> its okay. gave me an opportunity for a new adventure
<user1> Congratulations!  Don't be too nervous!  You must have done something right to get the job in the first place!
<user0> That's true, but the uncertainty always makes me feel a bit nervous.
<user1> That is natural.  I'm sure you will do great!
<user1> Did everything go okay?
<user0> Yeah.  They annoyed my friend some, but overall it was fine.
<user1> Well that's good.
<user1> Wow, i bet you miss her so much. My wife is going overseas with our son and they will be gone for 1 month! I know i will be miserable without them
<user0> It sucks, but it's best to keep busy with whatever you can.  Videogames helped a lot :P
<user1> I will play PubG after work to keep me busy lol
<user1> Well it will be over soon
<user0> I'm looking forward to it :)
<user1> I bet you are. I definitely woudl be
<user1> What has you so nervous?
<user0> I'm just unsure about the city...like what if I'm miserable there?
<user1> Have you considered taking a weekend trip there to see how you like it?
<user1> Did it leave you to do it alone, or were there others ?
<user0> There were others, but we needed all the help we could get.
<user1> I see how that would be frustrating.
<user1> I've heard about this movie but i've never had a chance to watch it
<user0> omg, you should! It's a one of a kind movie. I don't wanna spoil it, it's about aliens
<user1> Aliens? I didn't think it was about aliens, i thought it's about ghosts and stuff
<user1> Well I wouldn't know lol
<user0> Yeah me either. I have some friends that get to experience it. Fortunately they are sharing so that is nice.
<user1> I don't have any sharing friends either lol. You're lucky
<user1> What kind of food?
<user0> It was brussel sprouts and Liver
<user1> Oh, disgusting.
<user1> Did you start training him when he was young?
<user0> oh yea. Basically started the day we got him. That definitely helped.
<user1> That's awesome. I love a well trained dog.
<user0> Yes. I couldnt' handle a dog I have to keep shut up when people come over and stuff.
<user1> I know lots of bad dog parents. I've got a well trained dog too so, I understand.
<user1> Oh thats good for your friend, but it sounds like you really would like to live there! I can imagine feeling jealous
<user0> Yeah...I really am. I've wanted to live there since I was a little girl. Someday I will!
<user1> You will get there! I would just be happy and supportive of your friend and visit often!
<user1> Oh no, did you find a backup caterer
<user0> Yeah, we dropped them with enough time to find someone else, but it was unnecessary stress we didn't need.
<user1> Of course, the wedding can be the most stressful event of your life
<user1> i like to call them deadbeats
<user0> Normally I would agree. It only seems to be a few here and there. Most of the time I dont have problems.
<user1> what do you collect for ? credit cards or utilities ?
<user0> We are a retail outfit. So we have some big customers that pay on established terms.
<user0> Oh I just did that recently. I just got back from 2 months. It will be a fantastic time.
<user1> Where did you go?
<user0> I went to Thailand and Vietnam. Dont worry about anything. Traveling was so easy and people are nice everywhere.
<user0> What happened?
<user1> I woke up in the wee hours and thought I saw a person standing in the corner of my room.  It was just some clothes hanging on a door.
<user0> Oh wow, I would of been terrified!
<user0> Was it a large amount?
<user1> Yes! it was to cover his rent and he was supposed to pay me back
<user0> That's rough. I'm sorry that must put you in a real bind.
<user0> Congradulations on being prepared.
<user1> Thanks. I usually get somewhere and realize I forgot a bunch of stuff I need cause I packed in a rush 30 minutes before leaving.
<user0> It reallyi s the best way to do things. That way even if you forget something you've got time to remember and remedy the situation
<user1> Fortunately, my wife usually comes to the rescue on me.
<user0> Haha, sometimes wifes are nice to have around.
<user0> That sounds lovely. Did yall make it a special day to remember?
<user1> We did! We went out for lunch and hung out on the beach. It was very relaxing and a nice change.
<user0> That sounds fantastic. Im sure you guys will remember that day for a while. What a nice surprise.
<user0> why you should feel bad.. i am not getting you my friend
<user1> Not like really bad, just kind of bad that I went somewhere my wife likes when she couldn't go.  It's not a big deal, but I feel bad when I do things like that.
<user0> oh.. you must be sweet then.. your wife is lucky
<user0> What movie was it ?
<user1> Scream
<user0> The worst a movie has gotten me was Event Horizon.
<user0> wow lol I didn't know you can track ovulation. Good luck with getting pregannt
<user1> thank you :) oh yeah, you can track ovulation, measure basal body temperature, etc. I'm not gonna go into details
<user0> please don't lol i'm a man, I appreciate what you women go through when you're pregnant or on your period but i'm okay with not knowing details
<user0> Its the worse having to wait for something you really want. 
<user1> Yes it is.  She wanted two options so I wouldn't know which she'd pick.  She picked the right one so now it's just a waiting game.
<user0> Oh nice. Make a nice lunch to keep yourself busy. The delivery will be there in no time if you keep yourself busy.
<user0> Yes I agree. I did have a good relationship with my m other in law but recently it changed.
<user1> Aw I'm sorry. Mine is only a few years old but it's been smooth sailing so far.
<user0> Mine has been around 7 years and it's been a little rocky.
<user0> Oh no. Is he responsible with school or a job?
<user1> He does well enough in school.  I think that might make him think he doesn't need any disciple in everyday life.  Make me worry a bit.
<user0> I understand, he will learn though once he gets a job and has to pay bills that he will want to go to sleep at a decent time!
<user0> Did you have a bunch of people show up there at the party?
<user1> Yes. Friends, family, cake, all of it. Even one friend from out of town she hasnt seen in years.
<user0> That's a great job! Well done!
<user1> Thank you. Probably wont be able to do it again, but happy it worked this time.
<user1> Yeah, she seems like a great woman, you're lucky to have her.
<user0> She really is! I couldn't be where I am without her
<user1> You should take her on a vacation, or something. She deserves it.
<user1> At least you can handle those. I can't do any of those
<user0> I take some conselation in that, however my kids laugh when they hear thier dad scream like a girl at a flying roach.
<user1> Well, they would probably be the same if they were in your shoes
<user1> Understandable.  What was the reason?
<user0> I was working and I couldn't leave early
<user1> Did you explain it to them.  That's a pretty good reason to miss it.
<user1> Sure, that makes sense.
<user0> Fortunately, she rarely was gone for long periods of time, but I always dreaded this once a year work training she had to do.
<user1> How's your relationship now ?
<user0> Oh it's great.
<user0> Oh cool! What movie are you going to see?
<user1> I'm going to see the purge. I have been waiting to see it for a while
<user0> Oh awesome! It's a new one?
<user0> that's extremely sweet of you! you're a nice person. my wife and i made some blessing bags and we give them everytime we see homeless people
<user1> blessing bags?? what are those?
<user0> basically it's a bag with necessities. we put some water, some non perishable foods, snacks, some wipes and a little bit of money
<user1> wow that's a great idea! I will do the same! thanks for sharing
<user1> What a great idea, where did that come from?
<user0> Etsy somewhere.  My wife bought it, so I don't really know which one, but you can find a bunch on there.
<user1> Well I need to keep that in mind, great suggestion 
<user1> Oh wow, what a long trip. How long did it take?
<user0> Six days in all, but I wasn't rushing it. I wanted to see a bit of the country. It was amazing actually.
<user1> That is a long time to be in the car for sure.
<user0> It's not so bad really. You get used to it. If you remember to stop and stretch now and again you're ok. And there are some decent rest areas, some with free coffee!
<user1> Oh well that's a plu!
<user0> Oh yes. Anything to keep the eyes open and on the road!
<user1> So where did you stop along the way?
<user1> Well at least you have a plan. Are you planning to start the renovation soon?
<user0> Yes, hopefully it will all go as planned.  So far so good.
<user1> Awesome. I'm sure it's going to turn out great.
<user1> I can understand that. Did it end up going ok?
<user0> It did. I'm very proud of him
<user1> That's good. I'm glad everything worked out.
<user1> that's good to hear! Good for you! Maybe i should go to the pool too lol 
<user0> it's really fun and it's also a great exercise! Plus water is so relaxing
<user1> true! Do you just swim or you do some water aerobics?
<user1> I'm sorry to hear that. Have you ever been married?
<user0> I was engaged but my woman left me
<user1> I'm so sorry. It wasn't meant to be.
<user1> That's such a good tune.
<user0> Yeah, for some reason it takes me back to being a kid in the 80's.  No specific memory just a general feeling.
<user1> Yeah, it's definitely a classic. It reminds me of my childhood as well.
<user1> Maybe you just have to find a way to get him motivated, without showing anger.
<user0> True.  I just haven't found a way to yet.  Need to be more creative.
<user1> Yeah, just stay positive about it, I'm sure you'll figure something out.
<user1> Was it just a bad feeling you had?
<user0> It was as if something was telling me to get out. K had the same feeling in the basement. I've never had that happen before.
<user1> Maybe someone died there
<user0> Could be. It used to be a home for disabled people. We were both terrified, but we didn't say anything until we were back in our car.
<user0> Oh yeah, the buffering?  Very annoying.
<user1> Every once in awhile I get the idea to search for a movie, and almost every time it's either not listed or requires an extra charge.
<user0> I hear that.  Sometimes the classics are impossible to find.
<user0> Did you get her something special?
<user1> Yes, I got her tickets for a show in London that she's been wanting to see. She lives in Scotland, so the journey isn't bad at all. She's taking a friend with her.
<user0> Oh awesome, That is great!
<user1> I do hope she has a wonderful time. It's not easy living in a family with a disabled sibling and she just takes it all in her stride.
<user1> You wont know an answer if you dont ask
<user0> Problem is if she says no then it would make things weird between us.  I am afraid that either way I may not be able to see her again.
<user1> Just play it safe
<user1> That sucks, after going all that way too and you didn't even get to try it. I'm sorry.
<user0> thank you! I hope i can find it somewhere locally. i've heard bison meat is very lean and good
<user1> I hope you do get to try it soon. Be sure to let me know how it is!
<user1> That's funny.
<user0> Not so much.  It is such a thick scent and it follows you everywhere you go in the house.  I usually put him out when he starts it up.
<user1> Wonder if it has to do with his diet?
<user1> Will he be back soon?
<user0> I sure hope so! He's in the military so I never know when he'll get called on a mission :(
<user1> Okay, I see. That must be hard.
<user1> I think we've all done a version of that.
<user0> I found an empty aile a went to zip up.  Just then a mom with kids comes around the corner.
<user1> ha, that's too funny.
<user1> That sounds tough :-(  does he get back soon?
<user0> In a few months, he is in the military so he is gone a lot :( But I know he is doing it for our family and our country!
<user1> You must be so proud of him!
<user1> What was going on with her?
<user0> Chest infection which, for her, can prove fatal. She had to go on a special oxygen machine till the antibiotics kicked in.
<user1> That sounds pretty serious, glad she is okay now!
<user0> It was touch and go for a few days. My brother and family are such great carers. Wish I could be too, but they live in Scotland.
<user0> What sort of issues?
<user1> Like last night. She decided that she wanted to jump on the table 
<user0> Cats are always getting into things and causing destruction.
<user0> Oh no, could you ask your supervisor for guidance?
<user1> Doubtful.  I will try again and then try a coworker if not sucuessfull.
<user0> Sounds like you have a good plan. I wish you the best
<user0> That was very sweet. What movie did you want to watch?
<user1> it's called The Greatest Showman. it's a musical! So good!! I watched it so many times already
<user0> Oh ok! The gift was a good idea so that you ca watch it as much as you want'
<user0> So you covered him. It was very noble from your side to act in this way
<user1> It was, but it didn't help my feelings towards that coworker. 
<user0> Well, at least you did something good for that co-worker and most probably he feels indebted toward you
<user1> That is true, I just hope he was really sick. I hate it when I have to cover for people who are hungover. 
<user1> So you have to wait a week longer to see her again? That stinks.
<user0> Yeah.  It could be worse, but it definitely put a cloud over things for half an hour or so.
<user1> Yeah, I can imagine. At least it's only one week!
<user1> Great to hear that.I hope you enjoy your new life.
<user0> After such a long time we certainly will.  I can't wait to start making the house into our home.
<user1> I am sure you will create a beautiful house.
<user1> Oh I am so sorry to hear that. Have you had it since it was a kitten?
<user0> Yes we've had her since the begining.  She is older now and has suffered with feline AIDS for awhile.
<user1> That is so sad. I had a dog die unexpectedly and it tore me up.
<user1> Yeah I understand.  Are there any charities nearby that you could volunteer for?
<user0> I personally dont have time to volunteer but every friday i always make a small donation to my local charity
<user1> Well that's good of you.  Do you think homelessness is due to mental incapacities?
<user1> Why did he do that?
<user0> He threw me a surprise party and jumped out at me scaring me half to death! 
<user1> Oh my, did you have a good time?
<user1> I don't understand that either. It really makes you sick to think about. Have you experienced this?
<user0> No thankfully  I havent. I would never do it. Have you?
<user1> No I have not. I would never participate in that either. My wife and I are extremely happy together.
<user1> It always seems to work out like that doesn't it?
<user0> It does! I am hoping that tonight will be clear.
<user1> I may have to check that out as well.
<user1> Yes, but they also bring about a lot of good changes as well.
<user0> Agreed.  I know it's a necessary thing but I'm a little jealous of the time my wife spends with the baby.
<user1> Yes, the first years of a baby's life, the mother pretty much spends entirely with them. The husband is kind of left out in the cold.
<user1> That is wonderful! Moms are truly a gift! I miss my Mom at times. We are workcamping in the mountains of NM and my Mom lives in TX.
<user0> I'm sure that's hard at times. I've always lived close to my mom so I can't really imagine being too far away.
<user1> We have always moved frequently with my husbands job but my parents usually end up following us lol. Now that we are fulltime RVers, they dont follow. I miss that sometimes. I am glad you have your Mom close! Cherish those times!!
<user1> Wow, yes, I always feel the same way! I would love to pass of grocery shopping to someone else.
<user0> Me too!! Being so far out, it takes forever to get anywhere. I miss civilization lol.
<user1> I bet. I live about 20 minutes from a real town, which is far enough for me.
<user0> We are workcamping in the mountains of NM. It takes about an hour and a half to two hours to get anywhere lol. We havent seen new faces around here in months lol.
<user0> Omg that sounds like so much fun!!!!! Orlando? 
<user1> yes im staying at the hotel for the first time i am really happy
<user0> You are going to love it 
<user0> That's great. Takes a lot of dedication to be that prepared.
<user1> It sure does! I am so proud of the hard work that everyone put in!
<user0> You should be, not everyone can really be that dedicated about something.
<user0> What did they do this time?
<user1> Lots of little stuff.  They love to draw me pictures, crack jokes, and give lots of kisses.
<user0> Well that is very nice of them to do!
<user0> I am sure hes doing it to take care of you guys and I am sure you are pampering him too for doing it. 
<user1> Oh I am pampering the heck out of him! It got him a promotion! 
<user0> Pamper him all the way up until you get some lavish vacation! loooool Im joking, partially! Happy for you guys tho! 
<user0> What will you try and do?
<user1> I am going to apply for new positions. Hopefully I will get something soon.
<user0> What is your field of work?
<user1> I work in I.T.! Thanks for asking!
<user1> that is really cool i hope you get the job
<user0> Thank you! Have you ever applied to your dream job?
<user1> not yet but i think once i have the skill for it i will defenetly will.
<user1> That would bother me as well. Have you discussed this with her?
<user0> Yeah it makes me really jelous when guys talk to her
<user1> I can understand that. I actually broke up with a previous girlfriend over the same type of thing.
<user1> Oh that must have been so exciting and surprising! 
<user0> It really was. I had no idea he was coming to visit. I couldn't believe my eyes!
<user1> Did you all do some fun things while he was there?
<user0> We certainly did. Where I was working was a seaside resort and there are loads of clubs, restaurants etc. so we'd go to the beach and then party at night. Brilliant fun!
<user0> Well, that's a real tragedy.
<user1> I agree! I am so disgusted right now!!! We drink a lot of coffee lol. Its a 2 hour drive to the closest town to get another one too. 
<user0> Can you buy two next time and have one in reserve?
<user1> We travel fill-time in our RV so I don't really have room to carry a back up. I hope our next location is more accessible to civilization.
<user1> Wow, that must've been hard to uproot your whole life. Are you happy about the move?
<user0> I am actually! I was so ready for it. I basically studied moving so that everything would be easy
<user1> That's awesome! I've been wanting to do the same actually. I hope you have a fabulous time in your new place and new job!
<user1> What was the boy kid's problem?
<user0> He just thought it would be funny! He was also several years older than her and a teenager. Too old to know better!
<user1> Maybe he has the crush on her?
<user1> Im so sorry to hear that. Is there treatment or a cure?
<user0> No, the doctors tell us there is no cure. They are trying to treat the symptoms but thus far its been unsuccessful.
<user1> That sounds awful. How is he feeling?
<user0> Thank you, its been scary. He has good days and bad. 
<user0> Sounds like a nice surprise! my god how beautiful. 
<user1> I couldn't believe it. It had been almost a year since I saw them and she never even gave me a hint they were coming. 
<user0> Thats seriously one of the best presents ever. Im happy for you! 
<user0> Your hard work should pay off! Any strategies?
<user1> Repititions and exposure are my strategies.  Sumer semesters really ramp things up.
<user0> Summer semesters are difficult. I did them too. Best of luck to you!
<user0> Brought back a lot of memories I guess ?
<user1> While the actual incidents of each drawing are lost in time it did make me think back to when they were younger.
<user0> Always nice to have memories of the good old days.
<user0> Wow, what an awesome proposal that must've been. And maybe a little embarrassing, lol.
<user1> I was so happy when I saw him get down on one knee that I just blacked out lmao
<user0> Haha, sounds very sweet though. 
<user0> Oh no, what are you going to do?
<user1> I almost panicked as the winds started to gust, but thankfully it missed us. A few miles up the road weren't so lucky though. Always listen to those warnings
<user0> I never listen to those warnings either, but now I'll have second thoughts.
<user0> Congratulations! What did you name her?
<user1> I named her Dixie! She is a little basset hound.
<user0> Congratulations! What did you name her?
<user1> I named her Dixie! She is a little basset hound.
<user0> How sweet! Does she know any good tricks?
<user0> What?  That's awful!  How did you find out it was them? Did someone see it?
<user1> I could tell by the color of the paint left on my car, and their car now has a scrape with the color of my car. I don't know what to do.
<user0> Oh boy.  I would confront them kindly and tell them you'd like to reach a solution without there being a fight or problem.  Those situations are never fun. Sorry.
<user0> Thunder always keeps me up, it gets so loud sometimes! And the wind!
<user1> It is quite frightening! I wish that I could overcome my fear.
<user0> Yes, I could understand how it could be very fearful. It's quite scary to be woken up that way as well.
<user0> I'm so proud of you! I'll pray for your success! 
<user1> Thank you! I am very excited! It is quite unsettling though.
<user0> It's got to be so exciting though! 
<user0> That sounds lovely. Do you have many flowers?
<user1> I have a garden so fully packed that I can't see my neighbors at all! 
<user0> That is quite impressive! You must be very proud of your work!
<user0> That was very kind of them. Did they charge you for their labor?
<user1> No, they generously helped me clean up my yard and cut up a tree with their chainsaw, and they asked for nothing in return.
<user0> That sounds like a good neighbor. I hope that your home was not damaged.
<user0> Congratulations to you both!  What's he going to study in college?
<user1> Thank you! He is going to study Computer Science!
<user0> That's a great degree for the future and getting a job.  Good luck to him.
<user0> That's so awesome, I'm really jealous! I've never been either, and I'm actually saving up for a trip!
<user1> I have been a couple of times before, and it is such a magical place! Where are you planning on taking a trip to?
<user0> Disney World too, I've always wanted to go! I hope you guys have a wonderful time!
<user0> I'm sorry I hope you didn't get injured
<user1> The only thing to get injured was my pride. It was quite the gross experience.
<user0> lol I can imagine
<user0> they are such a bad company
<user1> They're awful. If they'd just employ enough cs people to handle the volume you could just about bear it!
<user0> oh yea exactly
<user1> Mind you, their product is useless too. Ok, rant over!
<user1> It's quite disheartening to know people jump queues
<user0> Yes. And I'm disabled and it's hard to stand for a long time while some idiot gets his lunch. I hope it was horrible!
<user1> I believe he will pay somehow. They call it karma :)
<user0> Perhaps salmonella poisoning? One can only hope, lol!
<user0> That must have been scary.  It's always better to be safe in a situation like that.  
<user1> Yes it was a scary time. We stocked up on food and bottled water and moved our RV about an hour and a half inland. Luckily the storn went to the north of us.
<user0> It's great that you had an RV to stock and pack more things.  Glad to hear the storm missed you!
<user1> Our Rv is our home, we are full-time Rvers! Thank you so much! Have you ever been through an evactuation? Did you feel prepared?
<user1> Wow you are lucky to have someone so thoughtful. I bet you were feeling great.
<user0> I was! It was so thoughtful and sweet, and I was very touched by it.
<user1> That is awesome. I am sure you will return the favor one day.
<user1> Did you plan the anniversary?
<user0> No that is where they decided to go but the thing is I called the place and they can't accommodate my special diet I am on.  I am so sad b/c that means I can't go with the.
<user1> Well, hopefully they still have a good time.
<user1> oh that's great. You must be the luckiest granddad in the whole world
<user0> Thank you, I try to be the best Nana I can be. We are hoping she comes while we are visiting for Christmas!
<user1> All the best buddy enjoy the celebrations :)
<user0> Thank you so much! I surely will.
<user0> Im sorry to hear that, its very hard to cope with
<user1> Yes, I try my hardest to be caring and patient with him b/c I know he doesn't mean to be harsh or hard to deal with at times.
<user0> It is, i feel for you! i had a relative that progressively got worse and its extremely difficult  
<user0> That's awesome! I love when people remember my birthday.
<user1> It was so thoughtful of them. I didn't even mention it was my birthday. 
<user0> How fun! I wonder how they knew.
<user1> I don't know. But they sure wen't above and beyond!
<user1> Did you study hard?
<user0> I did, I studied every day for week! I almost wore myself out studying. 
<user1> Then I am sure you will do well.
<user0> I really hope so, I am so nervous while I wait for my results. 
<user0> What did he do?
<user1> He got the highest score on a test
<user0> That is impressive! I hope he is proud too!
<user0> oh that is awesome! its so nice to get money in a lumpsum
<user1> It is! It's not a guarantee though, so it's just a waiting game, and not easy.
<user0> that makes it very difficult, and hard not to get your hopes up
<user0> Oh wow! I would be very angry as well! Unless it was some kind of emergency or extenuating circumstance
<user1> I am not sure. I just don't know why he didn't show
<user0> He didn't even call to let you know whats going on?
<user0> That is a great mindset to have, and should lead to a great day!
<user1> That is so true. Getting to know you also makes it seem like a great day already leading to tomorrow.
<user0> That is a very kind thing to say! i appreciate that
<user0> That is sad to hear. Don't worry, you will find someone that is for you.
<user1> I know but it's so hard because no one wants to be with me
<user0> It seems like that but it is not true. You have to be patient and you will find your love one day.
<user0> I would have been terrified, like need a nice strong drink type of terrified! How did it end up going?
<user1> Well i did have a few of those. It went fine. I was still nervous even after we landed in a foreign country. I just watched my surroundings. Everything went great.
<user0> Im glad it all went well! It seems that sometimes when you are extremely nervous it can make time pass quickly too. 
<user0> I'm sad to hear that. Have you tried using social media to make new friends?
<user1> Yeah, but no luck
<user0> Try going to the park then. You could run into someone that is into you.
<user0> That is awesome! Parents are the best
<user1> yea my parents are pretty great. Pretty maddening at times, but I wouldn't trade them.
<user0> lol i know the feeling! and being a parent i now understnd
<user1> I hope to be there one day and see it from that side.
<user1> awesome! was it hold em?
<user0> yes it was, it took a long time to do but at the end it was worth it
<user1> most def, i love playing hold em
<user1> I also do not like spiders. I don't even like watching Spiderman due to not liking spiders.
<user0> i have tried to overcome my fear but i just cant they make my skin temble
<user1> Maybe you can go see a doctor and he can help you with your fear.
<user1> The only video game I have ever played is Super Mario.
<user0> that is a great game the growth on video games has been amazing this past few years
<user1> It is a classic, even my kids enjoy playing it.
<user1> thats always terrible, but congrats on the anniversary!
<user0> Thank you. The restaurant came highly rated by a lot of people so I guess my expectations were high. I tried not to let it bother me.
<user1> that makes the situation worse when your expectations are through the roof
<user1> I definitely relate to that feeling, why can't they take us with them!?
<user0> I know, that would of been nice! Instead I was all alone for the last few weeks. 
<user1> Well, I hope she gets home soon, to make the home, a home again! :)
<user0> Me too, a home doesn't feel like a home without a woman. 
<user0> It is pretty crazy how fast grow up when you get older, it seems like a couple of weeks and they are in high school
<user1> yeah but i dont see him very often maybe that is why i always get shocked when i see him
<user0> That's definitely a factor, sometimes I forget about some of my nephews even exist.
<user0> I am so sorry to hear that. No one should have to go through something like that.
<user1> It's hard watching one of your parents get sick. We were at the movie theater when I found out and I had to leave.
<user0> I'm sure I would have done the same thing! But stay strong, many people have beaten cancer! Keep a positive attitude and stay by her side!
<user0> that was an awesome day for me too, hard to believe it was nearly  10 years ago
<user1> i know right time goes really fast and you dont even noticed, for me it was 13 years ago
<user0> agreed! its a shame growing up how fast you wanted to be an adult
<user0> Oh man, now that sucks! You gotta be careful on those wet roads. At least you're okay.
<user1> I know, I will have to be more careful next time. I shouldn't eat ice-cream while driving, 
<user0> Is your car still drivable?
<user1> It will still move, but I can't steer very well with the front tires missing. 
<user1> Good thinking.  You can never be too prepared, only under prepared.
<user0> You never know how long the power might be out for! 
<user1> Yep! or if you're house will be hit.  Many possibilities with tornadoes!
<user0> It could take a while for any sort of rescue to come! 
<user0> oh my goodness. what a blessing
<user1> Yes, I couldn't believe it. She's so sweet and giving, but I sure didn't expect her to do that!
<user0> it much be a huge weight off of your shoulder
<user0> that is great to hear! a faithful spouse is a blessing
<user1> I have so many health problems and he is always there for many no matter what being loving and caring
<user0> i am sorry to hear about that! i hope everything gets better for you!
<user0> oh no, I hope you did any sustain any injury
<user1> Only my pride! I wasn't at home when he robbed me. He took a lot of valuables. 
<user0> Yea, he will definitely get caught
<user1> I hope so! A federal worker like that should have more integrity! 
<user1> that makes two of us! i am terrified of all snakes
<user0> yes, i one time i was taking a hike and 3 meters to my left was a rattle snake i jumped like a rabbit and ran back to my friends
<user1> eww thats disgusting, and makes it worse it was a poisonous snake
<user1> Ah that's terrible. I would be annoyed as well I think.
<user0> Yeah its been a rough 2 weeks for me
<user1> I'm sorry to here that, but life goes on and tomorrow is another day. We just have to make the best with what we are given. You'll get through this.
<user1> really why is that?
<user0> Because I have always been with someone, so going in alone just frightened me
<user1> I think with time you will get used to it.
<user1> That is great, Why does he travel so much?
<user0> for his job. So, it can be hard, but we trust each other.
<user1> What does he do for his job?
<user1> Thats good, is it very important that this friend be there?
<user0> It is to me because he is my best friend
<user1> That makes sense! Im sure he will be there for you!
<user1> There you go! I need to work on that area of my life as well.
<user0> I think many do, but man does it feel good.
<user1> I bet you have more energy and more confidence for sure!
<user1> How you been together long?
<user0> We have been together for 10 years
<user1> Awesome. I've got you beat by 1 year. You know I just read the average couple from the time to meet to the time the ends things is 6 years. If you make it past that it will probably last for every. 
<user1> You are pretty lucky!
<user0> Not usually, I never win. so, it was very unexpected.
<user1> Maybe I should buy some. I never win either. Its about time
<user1> I am sorry, maybe she will share?
<user0> Perhaps, I just don't understand why I was left out. Seems unfair.
<user1> That is infair
<user1> I hate when that happens! Especially when you have been waiting for the beach!
<user0> Yes, and when you pay a fortune to get beachfront! But, we still had a good time, just wished we could have had less rain!
<user1> That's what matters most, that you had a good time and made memories!
<user1> Congratulations! I'm sure you earned it!
<user0> Thank you! I feel very fortunate to have been given the opportunity.
<user1> You're welcome. I wish you the best in the new position.
<user1> Oh no! That is awful, that can mess with your mood.
<user0> No kidding! It was hard to keep a good attitude for the rest of the day.
<user1> I can understand that!
<user1> I bet that is a rough schedule.
<user0> It really is, i hate being alone at night.
<user1> Does he get any nights off?
<user0> A few, but he still has to sleep all day, makes doing things hard.
<user0> It sounds like a great chance to start over fresh! Where are you moving to?
<user1> Alaska! We've got some transition time, but I've been doing deep research on Anchorage -- and the more I see, the more I like!
<user0> Oh wow! How exciting! I can't wait to come visit you there so you can show me the sights!
<user0> Ugh, why do people do that? It's annoying.
<user1> Right? Happens to my husband all the time and it's just frustrating.
<user0> Do you smack the women who do it?
<user1> No, since it's his associates at work!!
<user1> Yeah, they are so good! George Lucas is a genius! 
<user0> he is, i really like the new ones but always will like the old ones better
<user1> Yeah me too. I prefer the first three. They are very different from the others. 
<user1> You're unable to hold them in?
<user0> i can hold them but some of them are just accidental and it is the worst, depends on what i eat haha
<user1> I'm sorry, that must be pretty rough on you!
<user1> Wow that is awesome
<user0> Yes, it was so sweet and unexpected. We've been married almost 23 years so I guess I deserve it lol
<user1> That is a long time
<user1> do you pick up after them or tell them anything?
<user0> if im walking i pick up as much as i can
<user1> thats good of you
<user1> Oh i can relate i am also afraid of that
<user0> Yeah last year i went to disneyland and got on the elevator game and i almost cried hahaha
<user1> haha . I remember a time i was in vegas i was scared to go on this really high ride
<user1> i hope you get that call soon!
<user0> Oh, I did eventually, it just took like a month.  I ended up getting the job!
<user1> wow thats great, congrats!
<user1> oh nice, how long are you going for ?
<user0> i think me and my family is going there for 1 week it is going to be wonderfull
<user1> that sounds like a great time.
<user1> I understand that! what kind of car is it?
<user0> it is a 2017 bmw, i traded in my old car to get an awesome deal
<user1> Thats pretty fancy! Does it have all the bells and whistles?
<user1> That is great! I know my sister has had help with that a lot too! It can get expensive. You know they have new clothes from target at goodwill a lot, that helps with spending 
<user0> Yeah, it helps take some of the burden off of us. I will have to check out Goodwill and see if I can find anything.
<user1> it's like $5 for new clothes, good quality a lot. Great! Yes it is a lot to buy clothes for ever growing kids
<user0> Wow, those prices are great. I'll be going by there for sure. Yeah, the best part about them helping, is that they do it, not expecting anything in return. They just all of us and want to help.
<user1> THAT is the spirit of a true giver and the only one I would take a gift from! Great in laws!
<user0> Yes, they are great.
<user0> That is despicable. Did you report her to the teacher?
<user1> I did.  There wasn't much she could do, but at least I could still do the same paper without having to redo a bunch of work.
<user0> She could drop her from the class and give her an F!
<user0> Me too! Who did this to you?
<user1> my girlfriend allways makes me wait, it makes me really anxious ahhahah
<user0> I understand that! When I am ready to go- I just want to hurry up and go. I hate sitting around waiting too. Maybe you should make her wait and see if she likes it. Lesson 
<user0> That's so sad! Can you email them?
<user1> yeah i can call him and email him, it is just that i dont know when we will see eachother again
<user0> Can you see him before he goes?
<user0> Hey, that's pretty good. Do you have any goals set for yourself?
<user1> Very similar ones, but I like focusing on others success
<user0> Well I hope yours work out as well. Focusing on the goals of others probably gives you a lot of inspiration.
<user1> It really does, hope any you have works out!
<user1> Oh I know! I could kill people like that.
<user0> i know right, it is really sad some people cant understand they suffer as well as you and me
<user1> And they don't have a voice of their own.
<user1> Congratulations! What made it so great?
<user0> the fact that it took so much work and time
<user1> Ah, well you earned it!
<user1> oh.. congrats.. you must be happy then
<user0> yeah it is twice the size as the tv that i have at the moment
<user1> wow then... do you have any special plans to celebrate ?
<user1> Thats very admirable of you.  How do you help her?
<user0> We go out to lunch regularly.  She is depressed and I try and get her out of the house to do things.
<user1> We need more people like you in the world.  Theres always someone out there who needs a helping hand and could use a friend.
<user0> Thanks.  Yes she had some mental issues around the time he died but is doing better now.
<user0> I totally agree. People are too divided by their political views these days.
<user1> Exactly, let's comprimise and decide on things before it's to late!
<user0> Everyone is always fighting over these things, it's a sad thing to see.
<user0> Oh! pity about you. 
<user1> Yes, it wasn't very fun.  But I had to do it because my project for work was due the next day.
<user0> Hope you had good time after your work!
<user0>  I am so sorry to hear that.
<user1> Yes she was a wonderful black lab who died last year.  She was a great dog
<user0> I hope you find a new puppy love soon.
<user1> Thanks.  I do miss coming home to her.  My cat is just not the same.
<user1> I am glad to hear that!  What is happening with him?
<user0> He's become the top manager in his division in just two years.
<user1> That is awesome!  I hope he got a good raise
<user1> I can't imagine why people would do that. Animals are helpless.
<user0> I feel that pain ... as if I had been hit
<user1> You're very empathetic then! I hate seeing animals suffer as well.
<user0> it's something since I was born ... I'm like that
<user0> Hiking is probably a tough environment to meet people! LA is real nice, but I hear the people there aren't/
<user1> Yea it probably wasn't the smartest decision but at the end I meat a nice group. They eventually helped me from that situation also. 
<user0> That's cool! Did you end up keeping up with them after you left?
<user0> Thats sweet to have such a memory of her. Did she pass away then? 
<user1> Yes, she was very old. It was a great tribute to her life.
<user0> Im so sorry, pets are like children 
<user0> Teething is a hard period for babies and moms
<user1> it is! his molars are coming so he is inconsolable! Doesn't sleep good, doesn't want to eat. poor little boy
<user0> Poor baby. I remember my kids teething too. It was horrible
<user0> Ha ha, I'm sure he'll get the the hang of it eventually. It takes some children longer than others to get used to.
<user1> I hope so, i miss sleeping in a comfortable position without baby feet in my face
<user0> I'm not looking forward to it when I have a kid! I can't function without a good 8 hours of sleep.
<user0> How does that make you feel ?
<user1> I wish I were with them.  I love Italy
<user0> I've never left the US. I've never been north of Kentucky.
<user1> Oh wow!  You are missing out.  I love traveling and seeing the world.
<user0> I've spent my life turning my home into where I want to be, instead of where I want to leave.
<user1> That is true but there is something to be said about seeing other cultures
<user1> That was nice. What did you have?
<user0> I had a nice burger and fries
<user1> That sounds good. I bet it was fun to hangout and eat with your friend.
<user0> Yes I was appreciative that she wanted to buy me lunch
<user0> It is very annoying! I hate it too
<user1> Had to slam my brakes. I don't get people at all.
<user0> Some people should not be allowed to drive! We were rear ended 2 times last months! Can you believe that
<user1> yes, sadly I easily can.
<user1> That;s ok, everyone has some kinda fears that make little sense to others.
<user0> That's why i can't sleep alone or if i'm alone i always keep the light on
<user1> Hey, I can't sleep without socks. It's no big deal.
<user1> That is really nice of you! I am sure they appreciate it
<user0> They do. They get to smell the grass, they play they get their exercise, they get to have fun, they get to be a dog! 
<user1> They get to enjoy themselves and have a good time! :)
<user1> Oh no, did you have candles and flashlights available?
<user0> We luckily had candles around! I was so worried cause it was so fast it was like someone cut our power
<user1> Good thing, you have to be prepared for those situations
<user1> Oh I am so sorry. Cats can be very mischievous sometimes. 
<user0> I was so mad for the longest time but I've gotten around to not being so made about it
<user1> Yea I feel you. At the end of the day you cant blame the cat. It didnt do this on purpose.
<user1> Man I'm sorry to hear that...I've wasted a good protein shake doing that once
<user0> don't you hate that? gosh, i didn't eat anything the whole day because i don't have an appetite anymore
<user1> Oh well I was starving...I just rinsed it out with some mouthwash and ordered a big pizza lol
<user1> I use to live in an older house that had a tin roof, and I'd always love hearing the rain beat on it! Helped me sleep like a baby,.
<user0> It was the single most calming thing! I love the sound of rain on a tin roof too! 
<user1> I wonder if that's a common thing? It's very relaxing.
<user1> I'm sorry for that. Have you tried going to therapy?
<user0> not yet. i'm so broke i can't even afford it. I had to buy a new car and my premiums went up 
<user1> I'm so sorry but you'll get there in time.
<user1> I've never gambled. What happened when you were playing video poker? And is it fun?
<user0> Well, take this with a grain of salt, but it CAN be a blast. I put in $5 like I usually do, and on the first deal, I hit $1000. I went nuts, cashing out immediately and started shoving $20 bills in to everyone's hands and pockets!
<user1> Wow, check out Mr. Moneybags over here! That must have been a real thrill though.
<user1> Yes, it does seem like a fun place. I would love to go to the Mardi Gras.
<user0> Mardi Gras is great, but stuff happens every day. One time I was showing some friends around from out of town, and we heard some voices on the other side of a fence. We ducked through a hole, and found a bar with a full band playing - complete with couples swing dancing!
<user1> That sounds like a lot of fun! I wish I would have seen it!
<user1> I'd say that'd be a real disappointment to say the least.
<user0> You can say that again. One time, I loaned a friend a bike to get to work and back. A couple weeks later I heard he stopped going to work and had pawned the bike for drug money.
<user1> End of friendship.
<user1> I am not quite sure what you mean by that?
<user0> sorry that was sent by an mistake
<user1> That's OK, It happens to the best of us!
<user1> oh that little unfair
<user0> Trust me, this place was out of control. They had the pig pen and the chicken coup within a stones throw of the main house. To top it off, they had running clean water, but no toilet indoors! 
<user1> oh enjoy dude
<user1> Congrats! How do you feel about it? And what is the presentation on?
<user0> I feel pretty good about it.  I've spent the last two weeks crunching numbers about our holiday projections.
<user1> It's good that you worked hard on it. I hope you get a raise or a bonus for your labor!
<user0> I'll find out at Christmas.  Considering all the numbers I looked at, the possibility looks good! 
<user0> I think so.  Sometimes our friends show us sides of them that they rarely show other people.
<user1> That's definitely true! I am thinking of one person in particular to be honest. We waited all night at her house for her to join us so we could make this party. She never showed!
<user0> Did you make the party anyway?
<user0> Wow. That is a blessing
<user1> Yes, I didn't have a clue she was going to do it and it was very much appreciated it.She's always so great thought, I am blessed.
<user0> I am going to always take care of my kids like that
<user0> I hate doing dishes any way
<user1> I was super lucky though because my husband just went up and did them all for me! 
<user0> That's sweet
<user0> Cool I just finished today
<user1> I got an early start this year.  Most years I start late and they're out of stuff I need by the time I get around to it.
<user0> Yeah we had a hard time today lol
<user1> And then the stores get so crowded after a certain point!  
<user0> I am going to do like you next year for sure!
<user1> I think next year I'm going to start early but just do everything online.  All the stores in town were absolute messes today!
<user1> That happens sometimes
<user0> The worst part of the day though was when I dropped my last cookie I was really looking forward to
<user1> I probably wouldve cried
<user1> Was it like black friday? lol
<user0> YES.  *chuckle!*  School starts tomorrow here and it was absolutely insane.  The worst part was, usually I go to the store regularly before 10A because there's less people in there and I can just kinda stroll through the aisles.  Oh no, not today.  It was just about elbow to elbow!
<user1> Stick to your routine next time
<user0> I have to grocery shop on Thursday and hopefully the furor will have died down.  But I was in the checkout line and I swore that next year, I'm ordering stuff online and having it all shipped and just keeping my happy self at home!  
<user1> I hear ya! I am definitely shopping online
<user0> Especially since I was just browsing and a lot of online places have deals better than the ones in store!
<user1> plus you can usually get some kind of cash back. I love deals
<user1> Ew, I hate spiders. We are in the process of getting them out of our garage.
<user0> I hate the little things too! It was IN the glass at that! 
<user1> Oh no, throw it away!!!!
<user1> How was it too much?
<user0> Well, to their credit, they had advertised it as being quite interactive. A little contact is OK, but they wanted me to eat "mystery candy" from a box while blindfolded!
<user1> That sounds very strange
<user1> How big is the bonus usually?
<user0> It all depends, but always has been thousands. So, the waiting drives us nuts!
<user1> Wow, well I hope you guys get it this year then!
<user1> Why did you do that?
<user0> He has these crackpot schemes but they always work out. We turned that $400 in to $2000 a piece selling posters at a music festival!
<user1> Wow, good for you guys!
<user1> How old were you?
<user0> I was about 16 at the time. The thing is, I passed out right in front of the entrance to the house. Everyone coming and going had to step over me!
<user1> That is young, I wish someone had helped you!
<user1> Math has never been my strong suit. I'm more of a history type of person.
<user0> Me neither! That's why I was amazed when this girl said she had made a study guide and would e-mail us all a copy. I ended up with a B!
<user1> That was very altruistic of her! 
<user1> Why she is doing that?
<user0> She was trying to wake me up to get me to play with her! 
<user1> Ah ok I undestand.
<user1> why did you go back?
<user0> I had always wanted to be an electrical engineer, but had settled for life in the service industry (not knocking it). I re-taught myself basic algebra, and was accepted to a state university two years ago! 
<user1> good for you, best of luck!!
<user1> Oh no. Did you have a good backup plan ?
<user0> yeah i got into another college that was not as good haha
<user1> Maybe you can transfer after a bit ?
<user1> How did that make you feel?
<user0> Annoyed. I feel like he chooses her over me a lot. I hate feeling like I have to compete with her. 
<user1> I understand! I would feel the same way.
<user1> What do you mean by that? I'm not a gamer really
<user0> gaming has blown up this past couple of years 
<user1> Oh you're right, it has. I hear about it more and more
<user1> I hate that most parks close during the winter too. Do you have any indoor type amusement parks near you?
<user0> Not that I'm aware of. :( When February rolls around, all I can think about is how much I miss them and how I can't wait to go back.
<user1> I feel you. You will just have to go as often as possible during the other months to make up for the winter time without!
<user1> Ooh, congratulations! I'll be graduating soon too. What's your major?
<user0> I'm an Engineering major, electrical engineering specifically. And yourself?
<user1> That's very cool. My dad's an electrical engineer, actually. I'm a cybersecurity major myself.
<user1> What is your most prized posession?
<user0> it is actually a little medal my dad gave me when i was little
<user1> Why is that?
<user0> he gave it to me beafore he went to the army, and when he came back i showed it to him and it was really emotional
<user0> Oh wow, maybe he can get a scholarship! I know some colleges now offer bowling athletic programs.
<user1> Perhaps! He's joining the high school bowling team so that may help his chances as well. Do you like to bowl yourself?
<user0> You must be very proud of him! Yes, I love to bowl with my family but I'm not very good at it!
<user0> That is scary. Do you have means of defending yourself?\
<user1> No I don't, I do have two dogs! They keep growling at the noises to!
<user0> Maybe you can call a neighbor or something to see if they see anything suspicious outside your house! Don't hesitate to call the police if you feel you should!
<user0> Ha ha! I have done that, too. So embarrassing.
<user1> Yeah, my face was bright red when the ball almost went into the other lane! Thankfully there was somebody that sucked even worse than me in my party.
<user0> Phew, so they got most of the attention.
<user0> It can be hard in those situation I know you don't want to loose a friend in the end.
<user1> Yes, and there were financial and personal reasons of her own that is why I didn't tell her. Plus, I really hated to hurt her, but I guess I should have told her.
<user0> Yes you should but when you feel comfortable don't feel guilty you are the victim he is a sad case you got this.
<user0> Aw, that has to be tough not to see your friends. Do they visit often?
<user1> No, everyone's so busy with their lives and work that it's hard to arrange. Most of the people here my age do drugs or stay out all night, so I keep to myself at home, alone.
<user0> How awful! You're much better off staying at home. I hope you find new friends soon!
<user0> School can be tough. How many credits are you taking on?
<user1> I wanna say 14 credit hours for engineering classes. I have a part time job too I work 20 hours a week at.
<user0> Engineering is already tough. If you can get through this, I'd say you'll be very successful in life.
<user0> oh you're gonna be awesome i bet!
<user1> Thanks, I'm going to try! Last semester wasn't bad but I procrastinated more than I should have.
<user0> yeah that always happens, don't be hard on yourself as long you do great
<user0> Nice. What was dinner?
<user1> Surprisingly enough, a pizza from the bowling alley. I never said that I was picky!
<user0> I haven't met a pizza I didn't like yet.
<user0> I remember my kids going through that. Do you have teething rings for him?
<user1> I do but he doesn't like them. he can barely eat his mouth hurts so bad
<user0> Poor boy. I hope he gets through it soon.
<user0> What is the game about you must love games it will take up your whole night.
<user1> World of warcraft. I'v got a deeper reason then it being a game- it's how i meet my husband.
<user0> Really that is a cool story to tell when asked how you 2 met did ya'll play online together a lot?
<user0> Oh that's not good. Do they argue about small things?
<user1> Yes they do. They act like children and I am essentially the most mature/responsible one in the house.
<user0> Yikes, that shouldn't be. I think you've really stepped up in this situation. Hopefully they can see that and change their ways.
<user0> I love storms too but yeah, that's a nuisance.
<user1> It was extra loud and my husband was at work, bit scary.
<user0> Yikes! Lightning didn't strike real close by, did it?
<user1> O it sure seemed like it did, dogs were scared too.
<user1> That is good. Will it be a difficult semester?
<user0> It probably will be, as I'm studying engineering. I feel confident that I won't procrastinate as much this time though!
<user1> That is good. I am sometime a procrastinator.
<user1> Awww, what fun.  That must have been so nostalgic for you!  I wish I was back in childhood again sometimes.
<user0> It sure was! I enjoy reliving the memories, things were often simpler and more carefree back then.
<user1> I saw a toy that they are bringing back from a couple decades ago when I was a kid and wow, it was so neat to see!
<user1> Wow. Sibling's got skills.
<user0> For sure. I am here doing the traditional bowling style and he is spinning the ball across the lane getting strikes often. He makes me look bad!
<user1> How long has he been bowling?
<user1> I am sorry to hear that, I am sure you will be fine. What kind of job is it?
<user0> it's a desk job. Its my first time in a place like this.
<user1> Well, it shouldn't be too bad. If you couldn't do the work I'm sure they wouldn't have hired you.
<user1> That's a bummer. At least you will be more attentive next time?
<user0> For sure, that is a silver lining. Mistakes happen I suppose, can't expect to be perfect!
<user1> Indeed. If everyone got worked up over things like that, we'd all be out of jobs.
<user1> That sounds incredible. Did you visit the Great Salt Lake?
<user0> No I didn't get around to that area! I did visit Arches and Canyonlands national parks though. Even though I was by myself, would do again!
<user1> Man, I definitely have to go there. Sounds like a great place for sightseeing.
<user1> Oh my god, Do you think he got it just because you like it so much?
<user0> I don't think so actually, I haven't let him know that I love that type in particular so much haha. I am definitely wishing it was mine though!
<user1> That is hilarious, In a cruel kind of way.
<user1> Ohh, I feel you. I felt the same way, when I was planning to buy a new car.
<user0> Yep. Like, my current car is dying, but I almost literally want to drive it until it no longer runs at all.
<user1> Yeah. I believe you are emotionally attached to it!
<user1> Wow why would they even do that?
<user0> It was during a power outage during a hurricane,  still made me mad.
<user1> Sheesh, people will take anything that's not nailed down these days.
<user1> That's terrible to hear. Is it old?
<user0> Oh yes, very old. It's a 2002 and while I've had it for 6 years now, I'm finally starting to grow tired of it.
<user1> Are you thinking of getting a new car?
<user1> Me too. Its nerve wrecking
<user0> I know! Like, mentally, I don't care, but my body just responds by making my legs shake, my heart pound, and speaking too quickly.
<user1> Maybe you should take some classes to help you with that
<user1> Ohh, cleaning dog poop is always been annoying, yet petting the dog is always amusing.
<user0> Oh yes. I wish I could say petting the dogs counteracted having to clean up after them, but I would be lying.
<user1> Ha ha. I feel sorry for you though. No one likes to clean the dog poop!
<user1> That has happened to me several times
<user0> Yeah, not gonna lie my face turned a bit red and I rolled the windows up slightly. Thankfully they are very tinted so they probably didn't notice my shame.
<user1> Lol. They probably just laughed about it over dinner
<user1> Were you able to get them?
<user0> Yes, everything's taken care of, thanks to my boyfriend-- he surprised me with all of the books I needed!
<user1> That was so sweet of him! You're lucky to have such a sweet boyfriend
<user1> Thanks you for your service
<user0> it is a pleasure i am really proud i did this for my country
<user1> Which branch?
<user1> I have never had that feeling.
<user0> yeah it was a used car i was not expecting much but it turned out really well
<user1> Well thats good. Probaby saved a bunch of coins
<user1> I would also cry with you!
<user0> yeah but it has turned into a normal thing now
<user1> I cry at least a day!
<user1> oof that sucks really bad
<user0> yeah, i haave to wait till i get home to get the stain off, it is really embarrasing
<user1> yea i can imagine it is
<user1> That sucks, are you going to leave Texas or stay?
<user0> Well when it hit we left but now we are ok and we recovered well
<user1> How much did the damage cost you?
<user1> I do not even have a toilet.
<user0> Oh, so where do you go to do your personal buisness
<user1> I use the woods!
<user1> Really? Is that a promotion?
<user0> Yes. I was expecting that very much.
<user1> Good for you.
<user1> Were you afraid of heights and high speeds?
<user0> The high speeds. It had been so long since i had been on one. I finally did get on and we had a blast!
<user1> I am glad you did. Rollercoasters are thrilling and should not be missed out on!
<user1> oh wow! that sounds very special!!!
<user0> It really was and just what I need as I wasn't really happy about turning that corner into my 40's.
<user1> im glad your family did that for you
<user1> Oh wow! That must have been terrifying! Were they able to help her?
<user0> Yes, someone was able to do the Heimlich maneuver and she was ok right after that. It was quite the panic for a few minutes though.
<user1> I could imagine. It must have been amazing to see her rescued though!
<user1> That sucks. Did they give you any reason why they won't verify it?
<user0> Nope. I even double checked the login info and signed into my bank's website no problem. I feel a bit let down.
<user1> Well, I hope they can get you taken care of soon. I know I hate it when I can't get to my money I have online.
<user1> I am the same.. woke up at 6 for no reason
<user0> It sucks. I guess my body doesn't want me to sleep in any more.
<user1> LOL i hate that
<user1> What happened?
<user0> I don't know, it was very odd. I would go in the kitchen and the sink would be running a little bit even though I didn't turn it on. Kind of spooky.
<user1> I understand those kind of situation could scarry.
<user1> how did it go?
<user0> All things considered, pretty well. I definitely had some anxiety about it though. Presentations are my least favorite thing in the world.
<user1> i hate those as well
<user1> I am so sorry to hear that. 
<user0> Thanks. It's been especially hard because she was almost like a mother to me. 
<user1> I truly hope you can recover from this major loss in your life.
<user1> im glad to hear that! 
<user0> Thanks! We are getting coffee this weekend. Hopefully something comes of it!
<user1> good luck to you! i wish you the best
<user1> i think you had good skills with tools
<user0> I'd like to think so. I just like to be ready for anything.
<user1> thats cool of you 
<user1> Oh that's great. What are you going to be doing?
<user0> I'll be managing consumer relations at a law firm. I'm really looking forward to it!
<user1> Oh wow, that sounds like a tough job, but I bet you will be good at it.
<user1> Oh, I'm sorry.  What are you thinking of getting?
<user0> I would love to get an X-Terra! I'm a big fan of the SUV platform.
<user1> Nissans are very nice and rugged.
<user1> That is a great move!  I did the same thing.
<user0> I have high hopes for myself, as I have all A's so far. I hope I can keep up the momentum!
<user1> Good job, keep up the good work!
<user1> What was for breakfast?
<user0> Pancakes and sausage! How can you go wrong?
<user1> You can't! Sounds like a wonderful morning!
<user1> That's awesome, it's not easy to do that so kudos to you!
<user0> Thanks so much! It definitely relieves some stress knowing that I have a safety cushion. Hoping I don't have any emergencies though!
<user1> I'll keep my fingers crossed that you won
<user1> Oh awesome!  Congrats!!!!  How has it changed life for you?
<user0> I was a heavy drinker, and looking back now, I know I was in a downward spiral, I just couldn't tell at the time. Now I'm pursuing my education and have become much more healthy and responsible.
<user1> That's really fantastic!  I'm glad to hear you turned your life around.  
<user1> That sounds so great. Who was the one to come up with this plan?
<user0> We kind of all came up with it together. They booked it and we just pay them a certain amount of money each week, until our part is paid for.
<user1> I see. I wish I had a partner and we could go to such places together too. Maybe some day hopefully
<user0> I hope you can too. If its ok, I would like to pray for you, just to maybe help you find someone special.
<user0> What did she do?
<user1> She bought me a car
<user0> Wow! That was really nice of her! What was the occasion? You guys must be very close.
<user1> We are basically best friends. It is my birthday and she worked really hard to get a car for me
<user0> That is so awesome! I am sure you appreciate her for it. It's good that you have a great relationship with her.
<user0> Do they live in a different state than you?
<user1> No, they just are not wanting to come to it
<user0> Sorry to hear that.  Remember those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind
<user0> Souds like you were content.
<user1> Quite a lot, actually.  It was a nice way to spend the evening.
<user0> I feel you. Sometimes its nice to veg out and just watch tv.
<user0> Oh no! That's awful!  I watch animals for a few different people and I would never do that.  That's very unprofessional. Did they have an emergency?
<user1> Something like that, they were vague.  It was through a company so I couldn't really get much out of them.  Luckily a friend stepped up and watched them for me.
<user0> That's ridiculous.  I was going to see who might have helped you.  I'm so glad your friend helped.  Hope you had a great time!
<user0> What kind of dogs do you have?
<user1> A wire haired dacshund and a shephard mix thing
<user0> Do you like to watch tv with you doggies?
<user0> Do you talk with her on the phone?
<user1> I do, every night.  It's still hard going from having someone around every day to never, but I'll get through.
<user0> Will you throw her a comeback party?
<user0> Oh, that's cool. Did you find any good memories in there?
<user1> I did! He found my favorite childhood book of mine and I just sat there thinking about all the memories 
<user0> Nice! It sounds like a really good bonding experience.
<user0> I'm so sorry.  I know you must've felt helpless but coming from a wife's perspective; I would know my husband couldn't be right next to me but his words and love make all the difference. 
<user1> Thanks, that's actually really helpful.  It's been tough being apart for so long, we haven't been apart more than a couple days since we started dating.
<user0> I totally feel you.  My husband as gone for work so much for a couple years.  It will just be a season of life and then you'll be back together!  Communicating even more than ever and encouraging each other can help so much.  You're doing great!  I hope you're together soon!
<user0> So who annoyed you?
<user1> A guy budged in front of some other people, I confronted him about it, and we got into an extremely heated exchange.
<user0> So did it result in a brawl?
<user1> No, the guy eventually backed off and left, albeit not before he flipped me off a few times and called me numerous names.
<user1> I'm sorry to hear that. I hope he's feeling better now.
<user0> He is but I just felt so much love for him because there wasn't anything he could do
<user1> He's lucky to have you there.
<user1> I can understand that. Do you try to find ways to fill your time while you're waiting?
<user0> Not really, i just look at the clock and wait for the time to come and when they dont arrive in time i start getting anxious
<user1> Yeah, waiting for someone can be a real pain. 
<user1> I also love dogs.
<user0> I got a puppy not to long ago and love him with all my heart
<user1> Puppy's are the best. I love puppies!
<user1> how much did you pay for the surgery?
<user0> I was lucky cause I know my vet personally so I only paid 175 usd I was so scared for her
<user1> uhmnnn! scared of your cat or the vet?
<user1> Holy hell, that must have been scary! Did you see it happen?
<user0> im not sure but there was 2 victims i was devastated
<user1> I'm sorry to hear that. I really hope you are able to get over this and feel at ease again!
<user1> I'm so sorry!  That can be a devastating time. I have been there before.  How long did you have your dog?
<user0> I had him for 10 years. It's just so hard because he was my whole world
<user1> I completely understand.  Something that helped me was to have pictures up and also have a little remembrance each year with some other family that loved him as much as I did.  Just take it a day at a time.
<user1> Aw, I'm sorry, well I'm here to talk to you! 
<user0> I appreciate that. It's just tough because I go daily without talking to anyone. It's nice to talk to someone
<user1> I feel you.  I've been in that position, and it can get dark.  But there's always people online to talk to!
<user1> That car is quite expensive, I wish I could afford one too.
<user0> yeah it is i wish i could have a car like that
<user1> Work hard and maybe you could afford it.
<user1> That's sad, why don't you go visit them?
<user0> I don't have a car and they live far away
<user1> That's a bummer, hopefully you can still talk to them over the  phone or online!
<user1> that is not good, what was wrong with your food?
<user0> It was burnt and not appealing
<user1> did you ask for a refund when you realized the problem?
<user1> Why didn't you say anything?
<user0> i did not see any marks on the other car and was running late
<user1> Well then I dont blame you. I would have done the same thing
<user1> That's very nice of her, family is one of the best things we have in this world.
<user0> That is so true. I am so very thankful
<user1> As you should be, some people don't have anyone to lean on in their lives.
<user1> that sounds spooky
<user0> It was! I was so scared to be honest with you! The worst part is that I don't own a dog either
<user1> oh no i hope you stay safe
<user1> Nice! That's a very nice surprise.  What kind of car?
<user0> Its a ford mustang
<user1> Wow, she went all out, hope you drive safely and have fun with it!
<user1> I am really sorry to hear that.  Why are you ashamed?
<user0> Because they never invite me to go places, and they never call me
<user1> That is really too bad.  Did you all have a fight?
<user1> That's not nice of them, are they meaning to be rude?
<user0> I dont know. They have been my friends for so long but these pranks are just making me mad
<user1> You should let them know you aren't ok with them doing that.  If they are real friends, they will stop.
<user1> How come? what happened?
<user0> I was watching a horror film and then I had to walk home alone in the dark
<user1> Ohhhh.  Yea I would be scared too then.  That sounds terrifying.
<user1> That's good, where are they?
<user0> They are in Cuba
<user1> Wow, did they go there on vacation?
<user1> Why would she leave you?
<user0> Because she is talking to other men behind my back
<user1> oh no, i'm so sorry to hear that. I know your heart is broken. Did you try to talk to her about it?
<user1> What movie did you want to see?
<user0> I wanted to see the First Purge
<user1> Why won't you be able to watch it?
<user0> Because I didn't have a ride to the movies
<user0> Oh yeah that sounds very relaxing! I hope it was good weather for you all! 
<user1> It was very nice. There was a day or two of rain, but mostly perfect weather!
<user0> That's great! Im glad you had a good time, its always nice to have a refresher to get away from everything for a little bit!
<user0> Oh boy! Where are you headed?
<user1> To the Caribbean Islands. We are going with another couple that we have been friends with for a very long time.
<user0> Congratulations! I hope everything goes well! 
<user1> Thanks, me too.
<user1> Oh, wow. Its like that sometimes. You have to give into your sweet tooth.
<user0> Sometimes you just have to! It felt so great then but I hated it the next morning! 
<user1> Ugh, I hate the regret that comes with giving into food cravings. Don't be too hard on yourself. It was just one time.
<user1> how awesome. my husband is 7 years cancer free
<user0> Congrats! We are hoping right now that nothing comes back but It's so happy 
<user1> it's amazing news. congrats to you both. enjoy your time together
<user1> Six months!  I would be so mad!  What are you going to do about it?
<user0> He promised he would complete it within a month and since it's been so long, I called a contractor today!
<user1> Good call!  I would have done the same thing!
<user1> i think you will nail it, are you prepared
<user0> I hope so! I bought a couple books on preparing for interviews and I've done a couple mock interviews with a friend. 
<user1> good then you will do well!
<user1> i bet, have you told them how u feel about it?
<user0> I have but they rarely listen. They act like children and it can get frustrating. What can you do?
<user1> i guess just walk away is all
<user1> Well you can get better
<user0> I'm not sure it was really about my performance at all. I was surprised by the presence of my only adversary there, and informed that a large part of my position would be dissolved, and I would be answering phones.
<user1> You will do better next time, I promise
<user1> I do not have those
<user0> So I guess that sending anyone off to school is not a big deal to you?  Do you attend school?
<user1> I do not attend school
<user0> Do you have something you are looking forward to?
<user0> I am sorry to hear that, I hope you had some time together before hand
<user1> I was pretty close to my father and always lived close by. But, you always wish you had more time. But, the last words I said to him was that I loved him, and I'm grateful for that.
<user0> That is good at least, you had some closure at the worst
<user0> What happened?
<user1> we were walking in the front door and it had a glass door apparently but I didn't see it.  It was a very clean door.  LOL.  Later on that night I won a door prize.  which was pretty funny]
<user0> What did you win?
<user0> Oh that sucks.  Those are the types of situations where you can't help it, but you know you did wrong the second after it's over.
<user1> Yes, I was already not in a good mood, and then it seemed like she just pushed the right button. But, I knew I shouldn't have done it as soon as I saw the look in her eyes, I felt very bad.
<user0> Well, there aren't any rules against apologizing to your kids?
<user0> Yeah you can judge someone like that
<user1> It was hard to tell honestly, but it turned out the guy was lost and diabetic. He had lost track of his friends and had no way to get home, so I hailed him a cab and paid the driver $20.
<user0> Thats a nice gesture from you
<user0> Oh man, the beach always sounds nice
<user1> It's was great. The weather was perfect most of the time, and we were able to relax and enjoy it so much. We were really hyped to go!
<user0> That sounds like it was lovely
<user0> I am sure not many people noticed
<user1> Oh no, there were tons of people that noticed lol. I can laugh now, but not at that moment.
<user0> I can imagine, sorry
<user0> I am so sorry I have been there so many times
<user1> it's never going to be ok, but it will be a little less painful in time.
<user0> I am sorry you had to go through that
<user1> I'm sorry youve been there too.,
<user1> What did they do
<user0> Took a small toy, put it in his pocket. took it back to the store and made him return it.
<user1> Oh well, he will learn
<user0> Yea, he seems to get it now.
<user0> You do what you want, you earn it!
<user1> Still feel bad when I got an ice cream the other day
<user0> Why?
<user0> Why is he not helping?
<user1> I'm not sure! He has been busy with work but also has been going out with friends a lot :(
<user0> Oh, well work can be tough too sometimes
<user0> I bet you are proud
<user1> YEa, she's over come a lot for it.
<user0> I am sure she did
<user0> that is sweet, who from?
<user1> My husband! I did not see it coming at all, thought we were going to wait till the weekend to celebrate.
<user0> Wow, how sweet of him, you are both lucky!
<user0> What of?
<user1> My family and all kinds of old memories, birthdays, festivals, swimming, and other stuff
<user0> Oh, that is awesome, I love those trips down the old memory lane
<user0> Oh wow, talk about bad timing
<user1> The icing on the sweaty cake was that a giant horse fly kept buzzing around the room and the moment you got comfy would land on you
<user0> Oh no, I hate flies
<user0> I'm ready for a new start for my family and a better paying job!
<user1> That is nice. Having a better paying job is always good.
<user0> Yes! and new opportunties for my family. We need the fresh start on life. I don't like living in Texas.
<user0> Wow, I don't know how you runners do it. I can't stand running. How many miles do you run per day on average?
<user1> I love to run, did Track and Field in High School! Right now I'm only running 3 miles till I build my stamina back up! What do you do for excersise? 
<user0> I usually jog in the backyard, but not really running. I'm too fat to run.
<user0> Its always nice to get some sleep
<user1> Yes, my husband even cooked dinner for me today, and helped clean the house! He has been very helpful today.
<user0> Oh wow, that was nice of him
<user0> I am glad for you. I hope it continues
<user1> Thank you, my husband got two great job offers!
<user0> Oh nice, its good to have options
<user0> How old is she?
<user1> She is 4 and in Pre-school! She is doing so well learning how to share and also knows her colors!
<user0> Wow, they do grow up fast, appreciate the time you get!
<user0> Oh no, that sounds scary
<user1> Yes, I hope the family is okay! No word yet if anyone got hurt. 
<user0> I hope they are
<user0> That is not something to take for granted, enjoy yourself!
<user1> i just hope tonight won't be that night when my baby wakes up every 30 minutes
<user0> I hope so too, best of luck with that!
<user0> You can always start tomorrow
<user1> Thanks, I keep telling myself to stick with it but its hard! 
<user0> It can be hard, but you can do it
<user0> Why is that?
<user1> My boss has been unreasonable and a pain. He dosen't understand how much time I put into the company!
<user0> I get that, best of luck friend!
<user0> Did you have a good time?
<user1> We had a blast! I could barely contain myself on the trip there!
<user0> They'll always have good memories of the beach.
<user0> What kind of dog
<user1> She is a Jack Russell, she loves to cuddle in my lap.
<user0> She does sound adorable
<user0> How long did you live in your old one?
<user1> 10 years, i hope i get to feel the same way i did in my old house
<user0> It'll take some getting used to.
<user0> Sounds like you practice a lot to get good.
<user1> yeah i do i am always the one that steps up in the game
<user0> Are you the captain?
<user0> Is this a common occurrence?
<user1> no, it just started happening. I would say it started a couple of months ago. i will see a doctor in 2 weeks
<user0> That's good. I hope it's controllable.
<user0> I'm so sorry for your loss.
<user1> Thank you. I don't think it matters how old you are when a parent passes away, it's very painful. The vacation did bring back great memories with him though.
<user0> He sounds like a great guy. I'm glad you have fond memories of him.
<user0> She may be skinny, but it doesn't mean she's healthy.
<user1> that's true too! But i just wish i looked like her
<user0> Yea, I totally understand that. She won the genetic lottery there.
<user0> Have you tried speaking with the post office?
<user1> i did, the lady told me they can't do anything about it because it didn't have a tracking number. 
<user0> That's ridiculous, they should have to do something.
<user0> That sounds like fun. what did it bring to you?
<user1> Well, it wasn't one of his toys like I thought. It was a dead mouse
<user0> Eww... that's pretty gross. I had a cat once that would bring me dead birds too. I think that means they like you!
<user0> Watch out! Next thing you turn around, and he's driving.
<user1> I know! they  grow up so fast! I feel like i just gave a birth to him and look at him now
<user0> I hope you got some photos.
<user0> What happened?
<user1> I got two tickets for a friend and I for a concert. The day of the show, it poured and no one got a refund.
<user0> That is bad. You should have got refunded.
<user0> How'd that go?
<user1> Well the bathroom seemed cleaned but the roaches told me otherwise.
<user0> Oh god, roaches. Did you guys use the bathroom anyway?
<user0> Are you okay?
<user1> I'm quite fine now (my knee has a plate and six screws). I am just glad that the driver stopped and called an ambulance!
<user0> oh my gosh, a plate! That kinda sounds serious.
<user1> It might be, but considering I'm 29 with an artificial hip as well, I've gotten used to being half metal.
<user1> that is a lot.. most i ever took at one time was 5 classes and i cried at least twice that semester.
<user0> Oh my gosh then you know! I have to say though, it all came out in the wash - 4 As and 2 Bs!
<user1> Damn that is impressive congrats.. I took 1 class last semester and got an A lol
<user1> That's true. Did you finish the job?
<user0> I did get it done in the end. It was a nail biter since the client was leaving the day after the parts came.
<user1> That's really great. It's nice when everything works out in the end.
<user1> Oh, all the time. I've got to change my Depens three times a day.
<user0> Phew! I'm glad I am not the only one. Although for me, it happened in the middle of dinner at a small Vietnamese restaurant, and an employee walked in on me cleaning my pants in the sink!
<user1> Oh wow. I just would've blamed it on whoever I was with.
<user1> Oh, I don't know why concerts make me feel a bit sentimental
<user0> I think it's because everybody can relate when it comes to live music. My girlfriend broke up with me the second day, but we had to stay in the same room.
<user1> That must have been horrible! I'm so sorry you went thru that
<user1> Yes, some people call it fate.
<user0> You could call it that! I was supposed to go to a social event, but it got rained out and I ended up watching the rain for hours with my girlfriend.
<user1> That sounds so romantic!
<user1> Oh no, was it benign?
<user0> It was cancerous, but the surgery to remove it seemed to go well. A few days later he passed away suddenly, with no exact cause of death.
<user1> That is so terrible, I'm so sorry.
<user1> Do you dress up when the new movies come out also?
<user0> I don't anymore, but when I was a kid, a friend and I dressed up as the hero and the villain for the premiere of Episode I. 
<user1> Ah, I bet seeing all of the kids now dressed up does take you back to an earlier time.  Nostalgia has a way of getting to each of us.
<user1> what is a dive bar
<user0> Like a hole in the wall. Cheap drinks, sometimes a little dirty, but altogether relaxed - the opposite of snoody. They had a pool table and I showed her some tricks.
<user1> oh ok. We call them hole in the walls lol
<user0> Yeah, I should have just said that. Honestly though, my favorite places to drink.
<user1> mine too.
<user1> are you going to pass it down too?
<user0> I honestly hope to. Every time I look at it I remember the good times we had together.
<user1> well thats nice
<user1> Oh yeah that can be a mine field to walk across. Didn't have any issues?
<user0> Actually, an ex was in town recently and we went for a drink. She made a pass at me, but I told her to get some rest and went home to my girlfriend.
<user1> That's very faithful of you, and the right thing to do I'd say. 
<user1> Did a specific experience cause this? or just instinct.
<user0> just instinc i think i have always been afraid of heights 
<user1> Thats interesting my mother has always been afraid of heights, Not myself though.
<user1> I use to go to raves when I was in high school.
<user0> They are a lot of fun! I must admit though, I was pretty nervous when the cops showed up to shut it down.
<user1> Did you get arrested?
<user0> Well, there were only two officers and a couple hundred of us. By the time we were all walking away from the warehouse, I was actually laughing.
<user0> Why did she break up with you?
<user1> we where just not getting along, and did not h ave enough time to see each other
<user0> Are you still friends with her?
<user1> yes we are
<user1> Me too! the first one I ever went to traumatized me.
<user0> Glad I'm not the only one! My friend has a birthday in October and she wanted us to go to one as a group. I'm still not sure if I'll go,
<user1> That seems like a weird birthday activity.
<user1> Have you ever woke her up and told her to stop?
<user0> well it is not really her fault it just makes me angry hahah
<user1> Thats hilarious, my mother snores like a monster
<user1> Yes! thats actually amazing, you have a good friend!
<user0> I know! We played a round and they let us play a second round for free!
<user1> You are lucky! who won?
<user1> Yay! is it a family member having a baby
<user0> I'm having a baby boy!
<user1> What?!?! thats amazing! starting a family I imagine can be surreal 
<user1> Oh yeah? Where are you going?
<user0> california, i really hope i get to go to universal studios
<user1> That sounds like a lot of fun
<user1> did you do anything special during your alone time?
<user0> nothing at all. I was kinda depressed
<user1> that is not good, you should try to find an activity for when you are alone
<user1> tHat is insane, I usually give myself like 2 or 3 days.
<user0> Trust me it all paid off. When I went in to take the test, I was absolutely solid on the material.
<user1> Thats right! thats such a good feeling, just breezing through a test.
<user1> Where did she go?
<user0> To see her family. It sucked though because my car had broken down.
<user1> Oh, I bet that was frustrating. Did you get evey thing squared away and taken care of?
<user1> Where are you living at?
<user0> A very nice complex with 3 pools!
<user1> That sounds amazing
<user1> That's great to hear. What made you think it went well?
<user0> The interviewer made all the comments you'd expect from a good interview and seemed to respond well to my answers.
<user1> Those are good signs! Sounds like you hit it out of the park!
<user1> Pool's always a difficult game to pick up. I'm guessing your first time went well?
<user0> I shot so-so, but my friend ended up winning the table and beating 5 guys in a row.
<user1> Wow. Talking about cleaning up.
<user1> Are you still going to attend it?
<user0> Yes, I'll still attend but the extra help would've been nice.
<user1> Of course, but at least you can still afford it.
<user1> Yes, I agree, are you hoping for something in particular.
<user0> Yes I am. For everything we want for the baby to be gifted to us lol
<user1> That's a good hope. Good luck with that. 
<user1> That is great, I bet she is very proud of herself.
<user0> Yes, she is. My family and I are very happy with her accomplishments.
<user1> As you should be, so many young people give up before reaching their goals.
<user1> Me time is very crucial for anyone, it help one clear hi or her mind. We are so much alike..
<user0> It's true I do need my alone time
<user1> Sort of reduces stress,very crucial
<user1> Oh no! Hopefully he is ok. Did you take him to the vet?
<user0> Well she was ok. Shouldn't have been so silly
<user1> What a silly dog than! She will learn to not do that again!
<user1> That's great! Congratulations! Is this your first child?
<user0> Thanks. Yes it is. I already got a crib and baby bath.
<user1> Congratulations, again. Parenthood is truly a great and wonderful experience.
<user1> That's so cool of them. That's how parents should be
<user0> I agree. I really wanted to do it myself, but it's something I'll never forget.
<user1> We all need a little help sometimes
<user1> Great, where did you go?
<user0> To visit my family for about 3 weeks, I got married a few years ago and my husband and I live pretty far from them now.
<user1> Was it a good trip overall?
<user0> Yes, just very nerve racking dealing with the international flights and passport checks and security checks. Definitely an experience.
<user0> Yes, flying is very hard to do. 
<user1> Especially with 2 full suitcases
<user0> Yeah, and so little you can actually care on instead of checking.
<user0> Why don't you trust?
<user1> Upbringing. Dad use to say never trust anyone before I left for school every morning
<user0> He is correct. But you should trust some people whom you think they're good.
<user0> Wow that sounds pretty high to me. What was wrong with it?
<user1> Turns out, nothing much at all. A guy down the street got it running for $100.
<user0> Wow what a crook that other guy was!
<user0> Congratulations! Is this your first child?
<user1> Yes it is. I am over the moon
<user0> I'm so happy for you. Have you two thought of a name yet?
<user0> Was it any fun?
<user1> Yes, I got to see my family so it was great! I had to be very organized. The flights and layovers were kind of intense. 
<user0> Yes, I wish flying was a bit faster.
<user0> Oh no, what did she do
<user1> She met up with her ex to return his t-shirt..
<user0> Oof, that can get messy.
<user0> Congratulations! When is it due?
<user1> October, right around the corner! 
<user0> Are you excited? Do you have a name in mind?
<user0> Did you enjoy it?
<user1> I had a blast! It's supposedly a four hour float but we were out there for eight!
<user0> Amazing! did you go down rapids and do scary stuff?
<user0> Emerged from a bathroom? Intiguing. What do you mean?
<user1> He just sort of showed up and no one knew where he came from. He passed away recently after running away from our friends farm and being struck by a car.
<user0> OH - I'm sorry to hear that, but it sounds like he had a bit of character about him
<user0> It must be true love!
<user1> Something like that. My room was in shambles and the house was falling apart! I was mortified when she asked to come inside.
<user0> I feel like that sometimes - but people have usually seen worse.
<user0> Oh no! I bet you were terrified! 
<user1> The thing is, my alcoholic room mate was the culprit. He had even thrown some of my belongings in the bathtub!
<user0> Were you guys angry or frustrated with each other?
<user0> Must be such an exciting time for your family! 
<user1> Yes, it is!
<user0> Be sure to get plenty of rest thought! Its easy to lose sleep in such a time.
<user0> Oh, I am so sorry. Were you also close to them?
<user1> I only met him a few times, but he touched a lot of people's lives.
<user0> What a sad way to go. If only he could have gotten help.
<user0> Wow - hidden depths. Are you going?
<user1> I actually went last Friday night. Turns out she is an incredible guitarist - a real shredder!
<user0> Amazing. Just shows that you can't judge a book by it's cover
<user0> Oh my, did it happen to you recently?
<user1> Yes just a couple weeks ago. The elevator screeched to a halt and the lights went out, and I have to confess I screamed.
<user0> That sounds terrifying! Must have been like a nightmare for you.
<user0> When did you move in?
<user1> 5 months ago now. It's really nice here, there are 3 swimming pools
<user0> 3!!! Amazing
<user0> Wow that's a tough schedule. Especially with a new baby.
<user1> Yeah, but it wasn't really a problem, until one night around 11pm. I was changing her diaper. The changing table was in front of a window, and I could hear people running up and down the porch in front of the window and they were banging on the house.
<user0> Why were they doing that?
<user1> I'm not sure. Doors and windows were locked, but I was so relieved when my husband got home.
<user1> Oh that's awesome! What was the teen asked to speak about? Are they nervous?
<user0> He was nervous, he has to prepare an original message. He did really good, and he really showed and understanding of the bible.
<user1> When I was growing up I know that my youth leader made a huge impact on me, so it's really a great thing that you do working with kids. 
<user0> Thank you. 
<user0> try not to get so tense, that can harm your health
<user1> I know. But it makes me stressed out
<user0> Take a deep breath and calm the discomfort ... that helps
<user0> Cool. Pizza is my fav food. What movie you guys going to see?
<user1> The incredible ... they love ... it's going to be fun
<user0> I love that movie also. Have fun 
<user1> Thank you very much and you too..
<user1> wow i am so proud of that
<user0> Thanks, it was a long journey.
<user1> was it expensive ? any student loans ?
<user1> Did they give you any reason for not giving you the job?
<user0> Someone else interviewed who had much more experience than I did.
<user1> Well, at least a candidate that deserved the job got it. 
<user1> I bet. I'm not a very confrontational person so I do everything I can to avoid places like that
<user0> It was for work so I had to do it, but I typically avoid those places as well
<user1> You should bring it up to your boss at work for a security guard to accompany you next time!
<user1> Did you offer to replace the broken baking dish that you accidently broke?
<user0> Yes, I did, but she wouldn't even hear of it. She told me it was fine.
<user1> That sounds like a good friend, forgive and forget. She new you did not intend on breaking the baking dish.
<user1> That sounds good. Are you moving soon?
<user0> No, not moving soon, only wanting to and looking around to see what is affordable. 
<user1> I hope you find something that you like and are happy with. Its really important to be happy with where you live.
<user1> That is always a good feeling. Such a relief.
<user0> Definitely! And they are paying me back, so it isn't like I'm losing money either.
<user1> It was nice of you to step up and help out.
<user1> Haha, I can relate to that. I did that too, and my friends took a wonderful photo of it. They like to stick it on our yearly Christmas cards to each other
<user0> Hahahaha! Well, I guess we can make light of even our worst moments.
<user1> You have to :) Everyone has bad moments and if you can't laugh at them, then they just eat you up!
<user1> How exciting! That is a great accomplishment.
<user0> It's kind of a surreal feeling tho, hard to accept that he is grown.  Now college is about to start.
<user1> I know how you feel. My oldest is in her sophomore year of college. 
<user0> The time just flys by doesn't it?  It hard to imagine that they dont need you so much anymore.  
<user0> did you talk to them politely or yell back ?
<user1> No, I didn't yell back haha. I would get fired.
<user0> what industry are you in, i find that a lot in retail and service
<user1> Retail, yep.
<user1> Why what is it that you want them to notice about you that they bypass. 
<user0> Everything. I don't have friends so it's nice to get noticed
<user1> I completely understand think of it as maybe they are not meant to be apart of your life, you will find some good friends just be patient. 
<user1> What is exciting to you about swimming?
<user0> The fact of relaxing in a large pool of water. It just grabs my attention
<user1> So you prefer a pool to an ocean?
<user1> That is so sweet I love a caring husband has she gotten better?
<user0> She is much better now! I love her so much, so I try to take good care of her.
<user1> As you should a good husband is what keeps us women strong also good for you she is lucky to have you. 
<user1> I feel you! What do they do for you?
<user0> They help me with whatever I need and they are always their for me.
<user1> Its rare to have that! I have it now too. It is great to know you have someone to rely on and trust!
<user1> I bet that was a nice feeling
<user0> It really was. I am pretty thankful for them
<user1> I bet you were
<user1> Yikes! Was anything damaged? 
<user0> No, but that was my fear. I kept waiting to hear the sound of a branch or tree hitting my roof, or breaking glass.
<user1> That's pretty scary. I'm glad there wasn't any damage and that you're okay.
<user1> Wow, congratulations! That must have taken a lot of training and practice.
<user0> Thanks so much! It did, but she's so hard-working and I couldn't have done it without her.
<user1> What kind of dog is she, and how long have you been competing like this?
<user1> Did you stay with other relatives?
<user0> I stay with my older sister now
<user1> Do you Enjoy that?
<user1> I bet that's kind of a pain. How are you dealing with it?
<user0> Not very well! I mostly just stew and complain about it and wish I had his money and lifestyle.
<user1> I bet. It's so annoying when people show off like that.
<user1> ewww did you get a refund or at least a voucher ?
<user0> Yeah I got a refund. They were very sorry about it and I forgave them
<user1> I would have blasted them on Yelp
<user1> What about the them park made you anxious?
<user0> The roller coasters
<user1> They can be really scary for people who do not like them.
<user1> Why did your friend do that to you?
<user0> I am not sure. He told me he was sorry afterwards but I didn't listen to him
<user1> I am not sure I would be able to forgive someone of something like that, it is really rude behavior.
<user1> I'm sorry to hear that. Have you tried joining clubs or hanging out with people from work?
<user0> I haven't. Im too shy and I am scared of what people will say
<user1> I know how that is. 
<user1> I understand how you'd feel that way. Do you trust her around other guys?
<user0> I do not. I have trust issues
<user1> Ah. That can be tough in a relationship.
<user1> I understand. Horror movies freak me out, too. Did you watch the whole thing?
<user0> I did but it was really a challenge for me.
<user1> I bet. I don't think I could sit through a whole one.
<user1> How long ago did that happen?
<user0> It happened 3 weeks ago
<user1> I am so sorry to hear, if you need to talk to someone about it, I am here for you
<user1> she must not have loved you
<user0> I just dont know why she would marry me then.
<user1> people change over time, is she thinking of coming back ?
<user1> Was the weather good?
<user0> One small thunderstorm but other than that great! I'm amazed I didn't really get burnt!
<user1> That is awesome, I am sure you can not wait to go back
<user1> Perhaps try telling the person how it makes you feel
<user0> I am just too shy to say anything. I dont know how
<user1> Have confidence in yourself and be stern about it.
<user1> That sounds nice. How often does this usually happen?
<user0> Usually once a week. Its a great feeling
<user1> I hope this continues for you for a long time.
<user1> Was it for your birthday?
<user0> It was. I had a great time
<user1> Did you guys get to eat the cake?
<user1> its just the way the world is now, social media has ruined humanity
<user0> That is so true! I dont know where this world is heading.
<user1> it can't get any better than it already is now. 
<user1> Have you told them how you feel?
<user0> I haven't because I don't know how to start that conversation.
<user1> Just sit them down and talk about the way they are treating you
<user1> That must have been so annoying. Hopefully you can just get a replacement.
<user0> Yeah but it will take a few days because I have to wait for my paycheck
<user1> I hope he doesnt do it again.
<user1> that is so annoying, some people just dont have morals
<user0> No, they don't. Well, this time I've had enough. I've told management I want into another apartment and explained exactly why!
<user1> can you afford to move ?
<user0> Not really, but the alternative is to go slowly mad. These blessed individuals stomp around day and night, screeching into their cellphones - they're horrible.
<user0> How does it get you into trouble?
<user1> People take advantage of me 
<user0> I'm sorry to hear that. I guess at least if helps you know you can trust in the future and who you can't.
<user0> so proud of yourself right ?
<user1> I really am, I can't wait to start my new career!
<user0> you will be making more money
<user0> I hate going to the dentist, too. You just gotta go through with it.
<user1> I know...it's a necessary evil. But it hurts so much!
<user0> By now, wish it was less painful, hu?
<user0> that's cool. I wish I had my dream job
<user1> Well, it takes perseverance and a bit of luck, but you can do it!
<user0> My dream job is being born rich. Its too late for that
<user1> Lol, you and me both. You could always marry a Kardashian!
<user0> ick. 
<user1> Or someone not quite so objectionable :) Seriously though, I'm so happy for K with his new job.
<user1> Whoa that is always exciting. Baseball can be boring at times.
<user0> Yes, usually I think so too. But this was really fun to watch and we were so happy because it did not look good at first.
<user1> I love sports. I am glad you got to experience that.
<user1> Woot! That's great! Which brand are you thinking?
<user0> I'm thinking something reliable. Maybe a toyota or mazda.
<user1> Toyota is a great choice
<user1> EW OMG Did you kill it?
<user0> heck no, i told my husband to deal with it. i ran in my bedroom and locked the door
<user1> EEK! Sounds frightening!
<user1> That was nice! What does Scottish cheese taste like?
<user0> This particular one was a cheddar and it tends to be from smaller producers and is creamier and more flavorful than the cheeses we typically get here.
<user1> Cheddar is one of my favorites. I live pretty close to Cabot Creamery and I love their sharp cheddar.
<user0> Ooh, I haven't tried Cabot. Must look out for it. The cheddar I normally get is from Tillamook. I think it's from Oregon. Where's Cabot from?
<user1> It's located in a small farming town in Vermont. I went on a tour of their factory once and it was interesting to see the cheese being made.
<user0> I've never done that. Wonder if there's a cheese factory near me. I'm in NC, where the people almost all seem as nice as my kind neighbor!
<user1> You should definitely check to see, or stop by Cabot if you ever visit Vermont.
<user1> I'm sorry to hear that, that's very sad. Were you two close?
<user0> yes we were. He moved to the different country but we spoke pretty often
<user1> That's a bummer, I'm sure he is looking out for you up above!
<user1> Ah man, that's a buzz kill, are you still going to rough it out in the rain?
<user0> Nah, it said there's be thunder and lightning, so looks like we're stuck inside :(
<user1> Ah dang, well there's always next weekend!
<user1> Did you have a good time visiting with them?
<user0> I did, Yes. Work has been hectic lately so i was really looking forward to unwinding with them. 
<user1> What did you guys do?
<user0> We ate good food, drank wine and went swimming. 
<user1> That sounds fun.  Was the weather nice?
<user0> It was, kind of hot but not enough to complain about. 
<user1> What sort of food did you eat?
<user1> It is, but I think it was all along and people are just standing up for what they believe in more now.
<user0> True. I hope we can become less divided in the future and solve things
<user1> Maybe, but I think the best we can hope for is tolerance.
<user1> I'm very sorry to hear that.  Losing anyone close to you, especially a parent would be very hard.  Are you close to other members of your family and were you able to help each other through it?
<user0> Yes, my family and I are close and we were there for each other. But, my sister had passed away around 6 years before, by committed suicide. The last few years have been very difficult.
<user1> I bet it has.  Keep sticking by with your family.  I'm sure you are all there for each other more than you know.
<user1> What did you do to feel that way?
<user0> My sister, who lives out of state and i don't see often, was recently in town visiting our dad. I didn't visit with them.
<user1> I'm sorry to hear that, you could make it up to them by going to visit?
<user1> Cool! Who are you going to see?
<user0> Imagine Dragon and Grace Vanderwhall, do you know them?
<user1> Of course! Grace is so talented! She was on America's Got Talent, right? I get all those reality talent shows confused.
<user0> Yes she was.
<user0> Wow, that sounds amazing!
<user1> It is. I've been trying to switch apartments for months and this is the first time someone has actually done anything about it.
<user0> Great news then!
<user1> Absolutely! I move September 1st. No more stompy screechy neighbors at 3 am!!
<user1> How was that? Were you excited for some more quiet and for them to get back on a schedule? Or are you sad that it shows that they're getting older?
<user0> It was good. I am dealing with a mixture of both emotions about them being back in school. I was happy I had all the supplies, clothes, shoes, and other odds and ends in time.
<user1> Ah, that's interesting you say that. I thought you'd just be like everyone else, who say, "Happy to nudge them out the door!" You sound like a good parent
<user1> What beach were you heading too?
<user0> We went to Virginia Beach earlier this week. I was so giddy up that whole month I could barely contain myself.
<user1> Who all went with you? That sound so fun.
<user0> My husband, 2 kids and my mother. My kids had never been to the beach.
<user1> That's awesome, have you ever tried surfing?
<user1> Did you win? LOL
<user0> I was so excited watching the numbers being drawn, but no I didn't win. But someone did! I'm sure they were happy.
<user1> Winning those huge jackpots is always a curse.  Go for a smaller win :)
<user0> True, but it would be fun spending that money.
<user0> That is so exciting. A little extra cash can always help.
<user1> It sure does. It came as a shock, but a pleasant one. 
<user0> Yes, that would be a great surprise. It can also take a lot of stress off of you.
<user0> how was it
<user1> It was great! He has saved for so long to buy it. 
<user0> thats cool
<user0> You should make a wheel you can spin to decide.  I did that once.
<user1> That's actually not a bad idea.  Wish I had come up with that earlier.  It seems everyone wants something different.
<user0> Yes you put all the places on it and spin..
<user1> Im going to have to sue that for next week.  I think this week they can all go make PB&J since they want to be difficult.
<user0> Put that on there too!
<user1> I guess that way the wallet wins every once and awhile too!  lol
<user1> Oh me too! Do you have a monday to Friday type job?
<user0> Somewhat, I work 4 10 hour shifts and have a random off day during the week. Yesterday was my off day. What about you?
<user1> Oh that is a pretty good schedule. I am a teacher so I'm off right now. It's wonderful. 
<user1> Maybe its time for a new friend.
<user0> no i can't because i love him a lot
<user1> ask him to stop being a jerk?
<user1> Oh dear, that must be difficult. Are there medications to take that will help?
<user0> yes, but they are quite powerful which I am trying to avoid.  I am already on one and I am hoping that through this diet I can get off b/c the next steps won't be fun
<user1> Oh, I'm really sorry. That is for sure a challenge. 
<user1> I'm glad you were safe. Tornados are not a fun thing to experience.
<user0> No, they are so awful! They can destroy so much.
<user1> Have you only had to deal with one?
<user1> Well, that's very nice. I'm sure you were looking forward to that shopping trip.
<user0> I didn't know ahead of time! Mine had broken a bit and he saved up to get me a new one.
<user1> That's was so thoughtful and sweet! Seems like you are a lucky wife!
<user1> That is a lot of fun.  What is your favorite holiday to drive around in?
<user0> Christmas. It makes me miss my moms decor.
<user1> Im sorry it makes you miss your moms decor.  At least you have those memories to hang onto.
<user1> That must be comforting!  It is good to have people in your life that are supportive.
<user0> I feel so lucky to have her as a sister-in-law and a friend.  She is always there to offer a supporting ear and encouraging word.
<user1> Don't ever take her for granted!  Make sure she knows you are thankful!
<user1> Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Do you not live close to a beach?
<user0> Oh, no, it was about a 7 hour drive! My daughter was quite young when we went and didn't remember the first trip and she's a teenager now. So, a long time since we first went.
<user1> That must suck not living close to a beach. Hopefully you get to go back real soon.
<user1> Hah, seems we both had some luck. Good for him!
<user0> I know..ha ha!  He worked so hard for this and I am so proud of him.
<user1> You guys should go out and celebrate! 
<user1> Lucky! I would not trust anyone in my house!
<user0> We didn't have much choice, as we had an outdoor dog and indoor cat, so if we didn't, we'd come back to not having pets. But, I wouldn't just let anybody, that's for sure!
<user1> I am happy for you! 
<user1> Oh no! That's my greatest fear that people will tell my secrets
<user0> I know it really hurt me and I had to work on trusting her again with other things
<user1> Aw, perhaps she just slipped up? It does happen even to the best of us
<user1> Oh that can be scary. I don't watch horror movies because I know that I'll do just that!
<user0> It was so scary! Luckily, it was actually my shadow! The light made my shadow show up, but it first appeared to be an intruder!
<user1> Well I'm glad you were ok! Sometimes it's not just a shadow
<user1> That's the best kind of day.
<user0> Yes, it was drama free and a relaxing time.
<user1> Must have been so nice, what movie did you watch?
<user1> I am so sorry to hear about Riley, I know he was an important part of the family. How is everyone holding up after the news?
<user0> It was one of the hardest things I had to go through but I know that Riley is not suffering anymore so that helps
<user1> Yes that is true. You know there is peace in another place. He will always be remembered.
<user1> I can empathize with you there.  Do you think there might be another way to let her know? 
<user0> Well, she had custody of her handicapped grandchild and no job, plus she was very much in love with him. I thought it would just make things worse for her.
<user1> Well money is not everything, one day it will come out and then the timing will likely be worse.
<user1> Really!  Good for you!  Are you excited to start or nervous?
<user0> I am nervous b/c so much rides on if this works or not.  If it doesn't than I have to take some really powerful meds that i would rather not take
<user1> It's OK to be nervous, but don't let it stop you!  No risk, no reward!
<user1> That sucks, I work with people like that and it's just more work for other people
<user0> Exactly! You try nicely to explain it to her over and over, but she won't listen. Such a nuisance!
<user1> That's horrible, you should tell the boss and get her fired
<user1> I bet it was.  Death is never an easy thing to deal with, especially for a child.
<user0> Yes, she was only about 9, and loved her cat so much. It broke my heart to see her so upset!
<user1> I hope she will be alright!  I remember how devastated I was when my last dog passed away and I was an adult.  A kids emotions seem to amplify everything! 
<user1> You are lucky!
<user0> Not normally, so I was quite surprised. 
<user1> how much did you win?
<user0> $1000. It was enough to help me catch up on my bills. So I was happy.
<user1> I have never won that much. Congratulations
<user0> Thank you, that was the first time I have ever won anything like that. I almost passed out. 
<user0> Oh no! What happened?
<user1> Someone backed into my new car.
<user0> Oh geez, thats terrible!  Did they run from the scene?  Hopefully they left some information.  I was in a hit and run about 4 months after I bought my new car and I felt sick that it was already hit.
<user1> Yes, they ran! I was so mad when I got to the car and saw it. 
<user1> Wow. Do think he had bad intentions?
<user0> Well, she was attractive and at the time, I thought he was thinking that too. But, I know now he was just trying to help her get to a safe place, since she was falling down. But, it was hard to see it at that time lol
<user1> I understand.
<user1> Oh man...I hate checking the mail..it could be something crappy
<user0> Especially when you find your mailbox laying in about 10 pieces after someone knocked it down last night. 
<user1> Oh god- Do you live in the country?
<user0> Not really. I live in town, but it's a small town.
<user1> Then the person might be caught, do you have a camera? That is really crappy of someone! I have seen people put metal or wood pallets next to their mailboxes because of people doing stuff like this
<user0> That's a good idea. I might do that. We don't have a camera because we don't normally have any troubles.
<user1> It's a good idea to have one just in case. Murders, robberies etc happen even in small/nice towns. Just for your safety 
<user1> That sounds nice.  Did you have a good time?
<user0> Yes, kind of upset she was only able to stay in town for a few hours, she is on a road trip!
<user1> That is a shame.  At least she made a stopover!
<user1> What's the exam on?
<user0> It is for my molecular biology class, I feel pretty good that I am going to Ace it. 
<user1> I wish you good luck!
<user1> That's really cool! Was it your first game ever?
<user0> No, I use to play growing up. I haven't been to a game since graduating highschool. 
<user1> Well I think it really cool that you were able to get back into something that you used to do when you were younger!
<user1> That's so interesting because I saw someone post the same thing on a neighborhood app just today.  Is that you? ha ha.
<user0> Maybe if you live in Central Texas...haha! But I was so worried about that small dog getting hit!
<user1> Ha ha, guess you weren't the one.  That would've been crazy!  I hope its okay!  I'm sure someone will try to grab it.
<user1> oh my goodness thats terrible, i am so sorry!
<user0> Thank you, I am a mess. It is still hasn't hit me that he passed away.
<user1> i can imagine! my dad is my best friend i would be devasted
<user1> Hey I like alone time!  Just gotta find some cool stuff to do!
<user0> True, I'm trying but keep hearing creepy noises. Guess I need to turn the TV up louder haha
<user1> oh no!!  The ghosts are coming!! Yeah turn the TV up LOUD :D
<user1> Holy cow that's awesome!!!  What are you going to do with all that extra moneys??
<user0> Not sure yet, but itll help us life more comforatbly! We move to his hometown in November when he gets out of Army!
<user1> That's pretty cool!  Congrats!!
<user1> I am so amazed by her! 
<user0> That is very good. You should be proud of her.
<user0> theres always tomorrow!
<user1> Thanks! Being on a diet is hard, espically with family in town!
<user0> you can do it!
<user0> That's really creepy.
<user1> Yes it was, I think I need to start carrying pepper spray or something
<user0> Also some kind of sound alert. You think you could scream for help during those times, but a lot of people actually don't.
<user0> is that a good show? i have never heard of it
<user1> Yes, it's a great girly drama! Reminds me of Sex in the City but Modern.
<user0> nice! what channel?
<user0> That does sound like a great night! I think I'm overdue for one of those myself!
<user1> Yes defenitly, It dosen't get better then this! My daughter has been fast asleep since 8pm.
<user0> That's great. It's nice when we get some peaceful time for ourselves.
<user0> That is a big change!  Are you moving due to a job or something like that?
<user1> My husband is getting out of the Army and moving back to his hometown where he has a few job offers! Big changes coming..
<user0> Yes, that is definitely a big change.  I hope you settle in quickly though - change like that can be a drastic lifestyle upheaval, but it could also be the best thing ever!
<user0> Nice. Do you like your new neighborhood?
<user1> Yes, there are a lot of kids that our daughter can play with. 
<user0> That is great. Why did you move?
<user1> We had been saving for 4 years to buy a bigger house. We had outgrown our other home. 
<user1> I'm not a fan of doctors most of the time - how did it go?
<user0> I was so mad because I had to wait a hour after my appointment time before they called me back. 
<user1> I cannot stand that - they should not schedule people so close together if they can't handle that pace.
<user0> I agree! Everyone was so annoyed because we were all waiting forever. 
<user0> Aww - did you feed the cat?
<user1> At first I tried to resist, but I ended up adopting him!
<user0> That's how we have our cat also - how funny!  They are just irrestible at some point aren't they?
<user0> Ugh!  I'm assuming that it woke you up?
<user1> Yes! It was so aggravating. They would not believe me when I kept telling them it was the wrong number. 
<user0> Oh my goodness!!  How irritating!  I hope they didn't call back?
<user1> She did twice before she finally believe me that there was no Bret there. 
<user1> No way! Congrats! I'm having twins sometime this coming week
<user0> Wow! That is great. We were thrilled because we didn't know if we were going to have anymore and nature just decided for us. 
<user1> That's nice! Kids are great
<user0> Yes they are. They make life worth living. 
<user0> I've always loved Halloween! Some people get crazy creative!
<user1> It's peoples creativity that makes it so entertaining. Last year I went as a plague doctor, and everyone agreed it was terrifying!
<user0> That's awesome! Now that I have kids, I have even more of an excuse to go out and check out what creative ideas people have every year.
<user0> Oh no!  I can't even imagine that - was everyone ok?
<user1> Yes, thankfully everybody was safe. Nobody was even home when it happened. 
<user0> I'm so glad that everyone was ok.  But I know that was devastating - did you rebuild?
<user1> No, we just bought another house closer to town. It was sad losing everything that we had. 
<user1> scary! how long were you lost for?
<user0> Only a couple of hours. We flagged down an old Chevy truck and the man driving got us sorted out.
<user1> oh good... I was imagining days
<user1> Do you think she will be a good teacher for your daughter?
<user0> Yes, I think she will be a great teacher. She showed us her plan for the year and I think it was great. 
<user1> A good teacher makes a huge difference in how well the child learns and how much influence the parents are allowed to have - I hope your daughter has a great year.
<user0> Thanks so much. I completely agree. 
<user0> I just cannot watch horror movies!!  Did you like it?
<user1> I hated it! I didn't want to watch it but my husband did. The gore is just too much! 
<user0> Oh I am right there with you!  The last scary movie I watched made it where I couldn't sleep that night.
<user1> Yep! I feel kind of sick to my stomach now from watching it. 
<user1> Oh yeah?  Do you still look awesome like you did back then?
<user0> Well.... maybe not as awesome. lol But I do try to keep in shape. It was good seeing all my old friends. 
<user1> Yeah I bet.  Do you still keep in touch with any of them?
<user0> I do a lot of them but some have moved away and we just lost touch. 
<user1> Yeah.  Maybe you should hit them up on FB for a reunion?
<user0> That's a good idea! 
<user1> I bet you all would live it up and have a blast!
<user1> What did he want?  It's kinda scary when that happens, you never know what they want.
<user0> I was scared at first and then he hollered and pointed to the top of my car and I had left my purse on it. Boy, did my face get red. 
<user1> Well a good samaritan after all!  I'm sure you were embarrassed, but also glad that you didn't lose your purse!
<user1> Nice! What kind of car is it?
<user0> It's a 2008 Mustang. She worked the last two summers to buy it. 
<user1> Well deserved! I hope she enjoys it to the fullest!
<user0> She is super excited to start school now and show it off. 
<user0> Hey that's awesome!  Where ya goin?
<user1> We are going to Daytona and Orlando for 10 days. 
<user0> Holy cow that's awesome!  That's gonna be a fun 10 days!
<user1> I sure hope so! We've been planning this trip for a year. 
<user0> Cool!  Have fun and be safe!!
<user0> That's a nice getaway
<user1> Yes, it's been awhile since we had just some time for us. Plus, we love Blackjack!
<user0> Have fun!!!!
<user0> yikes that is pretty horrible
<user1> Yes, I was really surprised and I find it terrible behavior.
<user0> just seems so inappropriate and disgusting
<user0> Oh wow, I hope you cherished your time with him.
<user1> I did, but of course, wished I had more time. He passed away unexpectedly, so I was going over that vacation in my mind too. I miss him.
<user0> Sorry that that happened to you, I hope you're doing well.
<user0> What did you do with the money/
<user1> I just tucked it back for a rainy day. But, I may splurge with it this weekend, since it was unexpected.
<user0> That is smart. How often do you play the lottery/
<user0> k
<user1> Ok
<user1> That is great. Where is the award displayed?
<user0> At the department office back at the school.
<user1> Cool. Will you leave it there forever?
<user1> Did you get mad at her?
<user0> Yes, she doesn't have the right to do that. I have been that many years longer than her, and it was her work! I let her know it too.
<user1> Hopefully she won't do it again.
<user1> That was very nice of you.
<user0> The little guy deserved a Christmas and we really loved him.
<user1> That is showing the Christmas spirit.
<user1> Did you hurt yourself?
<user0> Scuffed knees, but mainly my pride. I was also in front an attractive guy I knew so it was even worse.
<user1> He probably forgot about it already.
<user1> You must of been hard working.
<user0> Yes, we have been working hard, as well as not always getting all the extras we would like at times. But, it's worth having some financial freedom!
<user1> That is great news. Congrats.
<user1> Oh no!  I bet that was embarassing :(
<user0> Yes, it really was quite so!
<user1> I'm glad you're okay.  Did you have the baby yet??
<user1> Do you not have friends?
<user0> Well, yes, of course. But, that isn't quite the same, is it.
<user1> True, but better than nothing.
<user1> oh man well at least its a good thing to see them grow
<user0> For sure! But, it flies by before you know it. I get my nerves on edge when I think about them all moved out of the house.
<user1> thats fair enough
<user1> Wow that's impressive!
<user0> Thanks. I thought I'd do poorly because I was tired.
<user1> That's what I thought when I did it but I got a 34.
<user1> Where did he take you to?
<user0> We just took a weekend trip to Tunica, MS. We stayed at a really nice casino hotel and just played some Blackjack, enjoyed good food and each other's company!
<user1> I love Tunica. Did you win at blackjack?
<user1> Oh no. hy did you do it?
<user0> She didn't want me going with that friend, but I wanted to go, so I lied to her. I was much younger then.
<user1> Did she find out?
<user1> Why wasn't it good? Florida sounds like an ideal destination.
<user0> I've been to Florida many times before so it wears on you.
<user1> I know what you mean but hey like you said, it was free.
<user1> Awesome, are you a millionaire now?
<user0> No, I wish. It was only a few hundred dollars.
<user1> At least you won something though. I've never won anything from the lottery.
<user1> I know how that feels. Maybe try reaching out.
<user0> That's a good idea. Maybe I'll try that soon.
<user1> SOmetimes you have to be the bigger person
<user1> Dang that's really annoying.  Is your insurance going to cover it?
<user0> Yes, but not as much as the car was worth and it wasn't an enjoyable situation.
<user1> Yeah dealing with an accident is one of the most aggravating things.
<user1> trust your god feeling, everything will be alright
<user0> I hope so. I've only had my dog for a short time and this is my first time away from him.
<user1> Did you buy all the essential items the dog will need? 
<user1> Nice! Are you married?
<user0> I am not, but I have a person I am very fond of. Are you?
<user1> I am forever alone. However, I hope you continue to have great relationships and a great life!
<user1> Wow! What was it?
<user0> A gorgeous vase. It's so pretty. I have no idea who sent it. 
<user1> I'd like to see this vase. Do you like flowers?
<user0> Yes, I love flowers. I can't wait to fill it up.
<user0> what did you do ?
<user1> I scolded her but then told her it was okay, but it's not the biggest deal!
<user0> yea thats true
<user0> oh no.. what happeneed
<user1> He was premature so he's been having some breathing issues. I hate not being there.
<user0> ah i hope it all turns out well for you all
<user0> I have, thats a very cool show
<user1> Their abilities to both imagine and create their characters is incredible!
<user0> They are very talented on there
<user0> yea i remember it seeing go away a few months back, sad.
<user1> Yeah, a lot of my friends and I got to thinking of all our memories there. Really makes you think back.
<user0> yea those were the gold ole days
<user0> Oh no, I am sure you can make it up to her
<user1> Yes I plan on it, its just been stressful time at home with a toddler, it slipped my mind
<user0> Well you have busy, it happens
<user0> Love is a great thing, I am happy for you
<user1> Yea, I wouldnt want to hurt him, i cant understand anyone who does.
<user0> Yeah, people can be unpredictable sometimes
<user0> you need to take them away!
<user1> I do for family time but sometimes I can sit in a full room and still feel no one is there
<user0> yea i just take them away and let them cry it out.
<user0> That is great!  Do you have anything fun planned for him
<user1> Yes, we are going out for a nice dinner. We haven't been on a date in months!
<user0> That sounds like a good birthday.  I hope you guys have fun
<user0> Ah same here. If only we had more holidays in a year!
<user1> Yea, that would really be great. Or maybe we'd get bored.
<user0> I guess we'll never though unless something monumental happens, and we get another holiday.
<user0> O? Same here. I love storms.
<user1> I don't, it makes me nervous with the strong winds and rain! 
<user0> Be careful and don't go outside then.
<user0> Nice! What game?
<user1> World of Warcraft, It's been my favorite for years.
<user0> Oh cool, I've heard of it but never played, I'm not too good with games.
<user0> I am happy for you. What kind of work
<user1> I work in Human Resources for a big company, I wasn't expecting the promotion! Feel Blessed :)
<user0> That sounds like a nice job
<user0> I feel you! Do you have everything facing the right way?
<user1> I do, everything is in it's place. It thoroughly bothers me when someone puts random stuff on them, like cups or papers.
<user0> Oh well, it happens though, don't be too hard on people!
<user0> That's terrible. Do you know how long it's been going on?
<user1> A few months, I'm not sure what my next move is. Staying in a hotel for a few days to think.
<user0> I'm so sorry to hear that. What did he say?
<user0> Good for her! She must be quite proud of herself.
<user1> Yes, I am very happy as well! No more buying diapers haha
<user0> Oh gosh. Diapers are really expensive. I forget all about that.
<user0> Oh they're all amazing in their own ways!
<user1> She's so cute and fun, i love her already.
<user0> What breed is she?
<user0> Nice. How much do you expect to make?
<user1> It seems to be about 60,000 per year just out of college. I am eager to see if the statistics are correct. 
<user0> That's a pretty good sum of money. I hope you start there as well!
<user0> We're all human so having a feeling like that is understandable.
<user1> I guess, little things at times right?
<user0> Yea, I'm always surprised at how much I sweat the little things.
<user0> thats a good movie, cant wait for the live action version coming out
<user1> Yes! I'm excited for that as well. I watched the movie with my mom when it first came out!
<user0> thats  awesome
<user0> 8
<user1> Opps. Ok, i mean that I was sad the other day because a friend is moving.
<user0> Is it far away_
<user1> not to far, but it's still sad to see her go.
<user0> Well you can still hang out since its not far
<user0> Are you glad its over?
<user1> Yes but I am afraid I might loose my job..
<user0> I am sorry, any backup options?
<user0> Why do you say that
<user1> People just can't seem to get along, makes me sad.
<user0> That is very true sadly
<user0> i know what you mean. my family is 800 miles away
<user1> My family is over 2,000 miles away in Alaska, its tough!
<user0> i feel for you. it really makes life tough when you can't just take a drive down the road and see them.
<user0> That's horrible. Did he get to go to the dentist yet?
<user1> Not yet, but I was his bedside nurse all day. Anything he needed I was sure to get.
<user0> That's very kind of you to be there for him like that. 
<user0> Oh no that's awful. I am sorry for your loss!
<user1> Thank you, she was 12 years old so I knew it was coming but still shook up about it.
<user0> Yes, we can never be truly ready to lose our babies like that. I have been through it several times. At least they are happy and pain free now.
<user0> me too. it worries me that all the food will spoil and my animals will get overheated
<user1> I agree.
<user0> does your power go out alot where you live? it only happens a few times a year here thankfully
<user0> Wow. Do you remember losing it?
<user1> No! I'm not sure where it came from! and I live alone :O
<user0> That's weird lol
<user0> I am so afraid of spiders
<user1> Me too, I think it was a wolf spider. I hope I can sleep tonight
<user0> I have no idea what a wolf spider is. It sounds terrible though
<user0> Do you think you'll do well?
<user1> Yes, I have been studying a lot but still worried. I need to get a good grade!
<user0> What class is it?
<user0> Are you prepared?
<user1> Yes. But mentally I am never ready to give a speech if im being honest.
<user0> I relate, what is the speech on?
<user1> It's on local politics. Not a fun subject either!
<user1> did yo make some good money?
<user0> Yea, enought to have great weekened anyway.
<user1> I cold use some money like that
<user1> thats awesome to hear, a lot of people cheat on each other frequently and dont care anymore
<user0> I know, I cant do that. I think it's very important to be honest in your love life.
<user1> i believe so too , if people are gonna cheat why get married at all
<user1> That's awful, but better safe than sorry. How were things when you came back?
<user0> Pretty messed up, but the house was still standing.
<user1> That's a silver lining in all of it at least! 
<user1> That's terrible. I thought they had to offer some sort of alternative. What airline was it?
<user0> British airways. they claimed because they dont have ties to the connecting, they could not
<user1> I've never trusted British Airways. 
<user1> You are so lucky to be talented enough to achieve such an honor. Was it as wonderful as you had imagined it would be?
<user0> Thank you for the kind words. You know what? It was, but not for the reasons I imagined! It turned out that everyone in the class developed a really close bond and while the advice from the teacher was wonderful, it was the lifelong friendships and mutual edits that the students do for each other that has proved equally special! 
<user1> Sounds like it was a once in a lifetime experience.
<user0> I think it was :)
<user0> Do you have any kids?
<user1> I do, I have a 6 month old boy. How about you?
<user0> I have 3- I bet you can't wait to take him fishing.
<user0> Was it at college?
<user1> No, it was at work.
<user0> OH wow! Did you get it all over youself?
<user0> That sounds like a really stressful situation. It's really good to know that there are still helpful people out there!
<user1> Yeah for sure! It was one of those things that once it happens once then you definitely know the limits of the car's battery power without engine running - so you make sure it won't happen again!
<user0> I'm glad you've put a positive spin on it :) 
<user0> Who do you support? 
<user1> Auburn Tigers
<user0> Cool. Do you play football too?
<user0> Oh no! What did you do?
<user1> I was reaching for some pasta sauce and knocked a few of them over. They shattered on the ground a such a huge mess that two workers had to come mop it up.
<user0> Oh yikes! That's a bummer. I'm sure the employees see that kind of thing all the time, though.
<user0> Oh that's super excited! I'm sure you're really proud of him.
<user1> Oh yeah, definitely! He put in a ton of work and it all paid off!
<user0> That's super great to hear! Well deserved.
<user0> What a nice guy.  There are fewer and fewer of those every day.
<user1> It's one of those things that in the day time you might expect but this was like 1am so I'm sure he would have wanted to get home as soon as he could but he chose to make his night harder to make my night easier. 
<user0> Are you goings going to stay friends?
<user0> Did you get hurt?
<user1> Yes, I hurt my back and couldn't even go to work. Shouldn't the dog be on a leash. Ugh!
<user0> I hope you get better soon!
<user0> That's never fun!  Large unexpected expenses are the worst
<user1> Yes they are. I had just put a down payment on a house too, so my money is tied up.
<user0> Oh no! At least you have something to look forward to, the new house!
<user0> Oh no! What a terrible thing to have happen! Were you able to confront them?
<user1> No, I was checking out when I saw it happen. I didn't even know them. I don't know why anyone would do something like that.
<user0> That is just awful. Now you'll have to pay to have it repaired. 
<user0> Nice. Did you like it?
<user1> I did. the scenes were really rewarding. also felt good to have all the tools and skills necessary 
<user0> That is nice.
<user0> It was who,who were them?
<user1> I'm sorry if I was unclear, I mean that the band were playing completely live (with no backing track).
<user0> Ok,thats amusing
<user0> Wow! thats great! I bet you feel proud of it!
<user1> Yes, very! It's also way more fun for me to put spin on the ball than traditional style bowling.
<user0> I bet you were full of joy and laughter yesterday! 
<user0> Oh no! Were you gone for long?
<user1> We were only gone for 2 hours! You just can't leave them alone I guess
<user0> What a bad doggie... hopefully they don't do it again
<user0> I can hear the sigh of relief in your voice. I bet your anxious about what the next chapter will be. 
<user1> yes very. but I know that it will be good. 
<user0> I can tell your proud of yourself. Im happy for you!
<user1> Thanks! I hope to learn from my mistake and continue to progress
<user0> You will be fine! Stay optimistic about it
<user1> I try to be. it can be difficult on some days, but I think I have a good attitude towards most things
<user0> I agree, but having great joy in life helps
<user0> It's good you're motivated! That's a step in the right direction
<user1> Thanks! I've realized that school is extremely important and I can't squander my opportunity away.
<user0> I agree. I wish I could go back to school and pay more attention
<user0> That's amazing and a very quick profit!  I'm a little bit jealous myself.  
<user1> Yeah. It is one of those strange moments where a place can go from being a place in the cheapest third of housing markets to being in the most expensive third in just a couple years!
<user0> It's amazing the effect something so seemingly small, like the company headquarters opening, can effect an entire town like that
<user0> Yikes.  Did you get injured?
<user1> No, but I was shocked at how a small 12 pound ball can carry you down the lane due to the momentum. It was quite funny.
<user0> Yeah and the lanes are really slick.  That's pretty funny and maybe a little embarassing too.
<user0> I would be too! That's a really nice car for his first car!
<user1> No kidding! I hope he understands the value of it!
<user0> I do too. Maybe he will left you drive it!
<user0> Wow you must be so happy! Nothing like a new car
<user1> I am very happy! It's nice to know that I don't have to worry about if my car is going to start or not either.
<user0> HAving a reliable car really changes things for the best
<user0> Nice! What genre of playlist was it? 
<user1> It was mostly hip hop and R&B. Stuff like Nelly Furtado, 2pac, etc.
<user0> Cool! I like to rediscover old playlists I made when I was younger.
<user0> I can only imagine! How is he now?
<user1> They still have more tests to do. Hopefully they will know something by tomorrow but it's so nerve wracking.
<user0> Doctor's are good at what they do! I hope for a speedy diagnosis and recovery!
<user0> That is great news!  I bet you are glad to get a fresh start somewhere new.
<user1> I just can't wait! I've seen the new place, and it backs onto a forest, so there'll be peace there, at least!
<user0> It is always exciting to move into a new place and make it your own
<user1> Yes it is. And friends are going to help me with moving. It'll be great fun - we can have a bit of a party while they help me unpack :)
<user1> oh , how he reacted next
<user0> It was a she! And she just glared at me. I felt awful when I realized my mistake.
<user1> its ok it happens with every one
<user1> Yes, that will be awesome! How long has it been since you've seen everyone?
<user0> It's been over a year and we don't get to talk very often because everyone is always so busy. I'm so excited.
<user1> That's fantastic that you get to see everyone again! I hope you have a great time catching up.
<user1> That is a great accomplishment. I admire your dedication in obtaining that goal.
<user0> Thank you! I didn't feel like I would ever be able to do it, but consistency does seem to pay off.
<user1> It's really hard to stick with something like that. I wish I could do it.
<user1> That great to hear! Have you started a work out program before?
<user0> I have but I've never really stuck to it. This time is different though, I've been going for a few months and feeling great about the future
<user1> You can do it! Don't forget to reward yourself for all of your hard work!
<user1> Sounds impressive, does he mainly play for fun or is he in competitions?
<user0> He's on his high school bowling team, but I think he mainly plays for fun. It's kind of cool seeing him get so much better over time.
<user1> Very nice, I would be proud too.
<user1> oh no what happened?
<user0> Well, they were shouting and stomping around, so I lost it! This morning, they've been quiet as church mice, so I guess it worked :)
<user1> that would really help if it was a permanent solution
<user0> Yeah, I really do feel bad, but it's been going on for over a year.
<user1> yeah enough is enough. i totally can't say i blame you.
<user0> Perhaps I'll try classical music next time - that might totally shut them up, lol.
<user1> bwahaha not to mention it will help you get some relaxing sleep.
<user1> I hate creepy stuff like that because I get paranoid.
<user0> No kidding! Once I came back to the kitchen and the faucet was running even though I hadn't touched it.
<user1> That sounds more odd than what I am used too. Hopefully nothing paranormal is going on.
<user1> That will be an amazing trip!!
<user0> I know! And they've never met their grandson so they will be so excited to finally meet him
<user1> That will be so great for them - I can just imagine meeting my granson for the first time - what a sweet time you are about to have.
<user1> Christmas was always a nightmare for me.
<user0> I'm sorry. That makes me really sad. We lived in a great neighborhood growing up and our neighbors were like family and always got together to celebrate.
<user1> I cried every year knowing santa wasnt coming to my house.
<user1> That is great! It's so awesome to feel confident after an interview!
<user0> Definitely. You go through so many it's easy to feel down.
<user1> Yes it sure is. Did you end up getting the job?
<user1> Was it a ghost?
<user0> I wasn't sure at first and, being in a wheelchair, had nowhere to go. Then the dark figure stopped in front of me. I thought I'd had it. Turns out it was my neighbor who couldn't sleep, walking her dog!
<user1> Oh,that was so hillarious
<user0> It is now. But it sure wasn't at the time. I was frantically looking around for something to beat my "attacker" off with!
<user0> That's great, keep it up if you can!
<user1> I'll try to do my best. i think i will also need to see a doctor. I just don't wanna get obese
<user0> It's good that you're being more proactive about your health now.
<user0> Man, i wish i could get one.
<user1> I know, me too. I really envy them every day when I get in my beat up chevy that I've been driving for 10 years.
<user0> I also drive a chevy and have had it forever as well.
<user0> Have you ever sold on Craigslist before? I always have the people meet me in the Walmart parking lot during the day. I have sold hundreds of things and have never had an issue like that. 
<user1> I did but my husband was with me and now he is out of the country for a couple of months so  i will be alone
<user0> It will be okay. You could also have the people meet you at the local police station. The police do not mind and would rather you feel safe.
<user0> Is it loud where you are now?  New places are always so fun!
<user1> Not with traffic, but with the people upstairs - they're a cross between hyenas and elephants!. My new place was quiet when I was there, so fingers crossed!
<user0> OH that will be such a huge relief I'm sure!  It's crazy that people behave that way, knowing they are causing other people such strife.
<user1> They're the most selfish, inconsiderate neighbors I have ever had, and I've lived all over the world! I just cannot wait to get into this other place.
<user1> Oh no! How did that happen and how much damage did they do?
<user0> I don't know. They completely cleaned out my bank account and maxed out my credit cards. I am fuming.
<user1> That is horrible! What will you do?
<user1> That is truly all you can ask for.
<user0> yes. Some people take these things for granted. it's really easy to take things and people for granted
<user1> I try to never take anything in life for granted. 
<user1> Wow, impressive. You must have natural talent. Do you plan to make more? 
<user0> thank you! I do want to take more and to give them to my friends who recently had babies
<user1> You can always sell them as well. I live in Amish country in PA and the Amish sell blankets for hundreds of dollars each.
<user1> I bet! Is it hard to have a long distance relationship?
<user0> Very hard and this was before the days of smartphones and FaceTime. We spent a fortune on telephone calls. But it was so worth it to speak to each other and I was lucky I could afford to fly out to see him.
<user1> I can only image how hard that was before the days of smartphones! I'm glad you were able to visit him!
<user0> Me too. That was one of the happiest trips of my life. The happiest was when we got married six months later!
<user0> Aww. It's the things money can't buy that bring us the greatest joy, no?
<user1> Definitely. Even when times get rough, there are still so many things to be thankful for. I did not always realize that, but glad I do now.
<user0> That is so true and it's a good perspective to have.
<user0> Dogs really are such great companions, what breed is she?
<user1> She is a golden retriever. Do you have any pets?
<user0> Yes I have a miniature pinscher, he just turned 15.
<user0> how come? it will probably be an exciting adventure for you to start
<user1> Oh yes, I really like school and my classmates and stuff! I guess just because summer is coming to an end?
<user0> the summer is horrid. heat, sweat, mosquitos, rain, and crowds everywhere
<user0> I do the same! I think everyone does.
<user1> yes but when i catch myself judging somebody i feel so guilty and bad
<user0> I think it's a normal human activity. You don't need to feel bad
<user0> That's the way to do it!  Be prepared to kick it's butt and get good grades!
<user1> I will try! It will be hard with a part-time job but I bet I can manage.
<user0> Always put your school first, you will be thankful you did later!
<user0> Whoa that's exciting!  What kind of car we looking at?
<user1> Probably some kind of SUV, maybe an Xterra or 4runner. Should be awesome when he gets it!
<user0> That's a really good/safe first car.
<user0> Thats awesome!  What kind of car do you want
<user1> I want an SUV, like an Xterra or 4runner. They are pricy though!
<user0> Well I really hope you are able to save up and get it soon!
<user0> That's annoying, I hate how little attention most other drivers pay on the road.
<user1> I have no idea how we didn't hit them but it was so scary
<user0> I'm glad that you are okay! Keep your eyes peeled for terrible drivers.
<user0> I can imagine. How old will they be?
<user1> She will be 30. It makes me feel so old, but also how fun it was when they were little.
<user0> Yeah but also just think of all the amazing movies she has done. 
<user0> Now that you what? Tell me!
<user1> Sorry, I accidentally hit enter haha. Now that I've been working out for about a month!
<user0> Oh that is great! I've heard that exercise can really help mentally and physically!
<user0> That's great! Did you get anything you are especially excited about? It's a restaurant and a store?
<user1> Yes, it's both. I got a chickpea curry with basmati rice that a local Indian lady made. And a bag of dragon tongue beans, which are delicious!
<user0> Dragon tongue beans! I've never heard of them! What do they look like?
<user1> They're the same shape as regular green beans, but lighter in color and they have red streaks through them. You treat them as you would green beans.
<user0> I will have to look for those. We have a huge variety of foods where I live, but this is new to me. 
<user1> What I love about this store is it sources all of its produce locally and its all organic. So you get some strange, different things to try!
<user0> It sounds amazing! Are the prices good?
<user0> How did he scare you?
<user1> Like he jumped out from behind a door and scared me. I was not expecting it!
<user0> I bet that gave you a good scare! Gotta love dads and step dads!
<user0> Oh that sounds disgusting! 
<user1> Yeah it was gross. He probably should get stitches.
<user0> I hope he gets that taken care of!
<user0> I think we never really know what is going on inside people's mind. Celebrities like Anthony and Robin Williams seems to live a good life, but in reality, they are suffering.
<user1> It's awful. I really wish far more resources were put toward mental health facilities and counselling in this country!
<user0> I completely agree! I think it would even help lower crime rates.
<user1> Most definitely. We actually need these resources to get mentally disturbed people off the streets and get them the help they deserve.
<user0> All around, it would be a good decision for society. Just last night, I was watching Live PD and there was a young man stealing a candy bar. He was a drug addict. I believe if he had the help he needed, he would not have to steal tiny amounts of food.
<user1> There's so much we could be doing to help those in need and yet our politicians (on both sides!) are off helping the rich and corporations - it's disgusting.
<user1> Oh no. I'm so sorry. Can you video chat with her?
<user0> Well I was finally able to go and visit her and the house and visit was exactly as I remembered it as a child.  It gave me such great memories!
<user1> How wonderful. That's what's important and makes life meaningful in my opinion.
<user1> Wow! That is insane, too bad you didn't bet with those kind of odds.
<user0> Yeah, for sure! It was one of those nights where we were journey is what's fun rather than what you were aiming to do, if you get me. We went from sports bar to sports bar trying to see who would show the event and by the time we gave up we'd had such a funny night and the race had turned out great!
<user1> That sounds like a great time, one of those nights you always remember!
<user1> Yeah the older they get the more teachers they usually get. I think it's good because they get a variety.
<user0> That's true.  I was a little startled b/c I don't remember changing classes for things until 7th grade.  Just a reminder that kids grow up so much faster now.
<user1> Yeah schools definitely start things younger now. Kindergarten used to be voluntary back in the day!
<user0> That's true - when I was in kindergarten, we only went for half the day.
<user0> I can understand that as I live in Florida and we prepare for hurricanes each year with a plan and emergency rations and supplies.
<user1> It feels good to get everything together, doesn't it? You feel as if you're ready for anything!
<user0> Yes, you are correct. You can always "hope" for the best, but also "plan" for the worst. Being prepared is a comfortable feeling.
<user1> I like that saying - it's very good advice. I'm all for advance action as it saves headaches (or worse!) later on.
<user1> That's wonderful, they say children have a certain gift for picking up languages.
<user0> he actually speaks 2 languages. I teach him english and russian
<user1> Wow! That's impressive and a lasting skill for your child to develop.
<user1> Did you think about moving after that?
<user0> Funny you should mention that - in three weeks time, lol.
<user1> haha are you serious? Did you move in with your girlfriend?
<user0> No, moving to a 1-bedroom apartment. I don't have a girlfriend - I had a husband, but we split up.
<user0> Oh wow! I hope that it was ok!
<user1> My husband is allergic to cats to, I'm not sure how it got there. We had to call animal control to get it out safely!
<user0> Oh no. That sounds really stressful!
<user0> That is very unusual. She should be proud of herself.
<user1> Yes, she should. She joined a community garden and helps out there, she got a part time job and took up badminton - not something she'd ever done before!
<user0> Wow, I wish more would follow her example. That's a recovery.
<user1> She's a very strong person and she also has lots of friends and family to help her. She's a lovely person and deserves the best in life!
<user1> I haven't watched actual TV in sooo long. What do you watch on Hulu?
<user0> I love to watch Home shows on HGTV and Bachelor in Paridise on ABC. Hulu live has been a great value for the price!
<user1> That's real neat, I might check it out. I've only ever used Netflix, but Netflix is pretty good too.
<user1> Aw, I bet he feels horrible about it.  Poor kitty!
<user0> Yes, we had to call animal control to retreive the body! I hope it wasn't someone pet.
<user1> Aw, that's always sad, I lost a cat once and I assume that's what happened to her ;(
<user1> That would be horrific.  Do you know someone that this happened to?
<user0> Yes, I heard about it. Such a sad story.
<user1> That is just horrible.  I think they would have to medicate me for the rest of my life if that happendd.
<user1> That is nice of your friend. I hope you enjoyed it.
<user0> I did! It was a very nice gesture.
<user1> You can return the favor one day. That is what friends are for!
<user1> Do you have any idea where you will go? Is it accompanied?
<user0> Yes, we know where we are going just haven't gotten the official orders.
<user1> Well I hope they get there soon so you don't have to wait longer.
<user1> I'm with you on this one.  What is up with people these days, I just don't understand how they could do that.
<user0> Right, these poor animals have no clue why people are mean to them. Some people are heartless.
<user1> I think there should be stiffer penalties for people that do things like that, for instance more jail time.
<user1> i had a similar experience, i miss it too
<user0> It's nice to think back, tho' and relive the old days. We have our own traditions now, but the good old days will always remain just that!
<user1> i totally agree
<user0> It's funny, we always remember the successful, fun times and forget about the not-so-perfect things. Must be our minds' defense kicking in! 
<user0> I know that when just the 4 people in my family do go out, it runs us about $65.  So we do it very rarely, it wastes a lot of money.
<user1> Yes, exactly. A friend was telling me they spent almost $300 a week on eating out. I don't even spend that much on groceries. 
<user0> A week!?  That is just crazy, and pretty irresponsible unless you are a millionaire.
<user0> Where to?
<user1> Texas, there's so much to do there so I'm happy for the change. 
<user0> I spent some time there, when I was learning how to be an Army Medic. I really enjoyed my time there!
<user1> Awesome, my husband is Air Force and we have been in Mississippi for 4 years. Texas sounds better.
<user1> It's better to be safe than sorry. You can't overprepare.
<user0> So true. Luckily it didn't get as bad as they thought so we didn't have to evauate.
<user1> I am glad you didn't get hit. I know how stressful hurricanes can be.
<user1> I bet! I hope you were able to catch up!
<user0> Oh yes, and then some! They both looked so well and had lots to say. What a laugh we had. I'm so fortunate to have such a wonderful family!
<user1> You are very lucky!
<user0> Yes I am! When I hear how some families are I feel very blessed. They are very special people.
<user0> That's strange, I hope she makes it out ok this time though.
<user1> She is super tiny and they said with small dogs the stress of the procedure will give them stomach issues sometimes.  I wouldnt even do it except she has an abcess
<user0> Oh wow, I would never consider something like that hurting a dog.
<user0> I'm sorry to hear that. I hope she passed peacefully.
<user1> Yes, it seemed so.  I really had fun reconnecting with her as an adult, so it was really hard when she passed.
<user0> I am sure she appreciated your visit before her passing. She must have felt loved.
<user0> That was a really smart call on your part! Were you worried?
<user1> I was very worried but we were lucky eventually and someone stopped and helped and we went on with our vacation.
<user0> Well, it was a very smart thing you did packing those extra supplies.
<user0> That sounds pretty stressful. Are you moving soon?
<user1> Yes, don't know exactly when but I hate being rushed so I've been doing what I can.
<user0> That makes sense. I hate leaving things for the last second as well. Hopefully you won't have to leave everything boxed up for too long.
<user0> That is great! You are lucky!
<user1> I do feel very lucky, especially to find someone who is as satisfied as I am in our old age.
<user0> It is a wonderful thing that you have someone to share your life with.
<user0> Nice! Which ones did you hear!
<user1> Mambo #5, Missy Elliot, and Ricky Martin. It really took me back
<user0> That one is a zinger! I remember listening to that when I took my grandma to prom!
<user0> How did you do?
<user1> I don't know yet. The wait is killing me and I'm not confident I did well.
<user0> Im sure you did fine. what was the subject?
<user1> Discrete mathematics 
<user1> That is great! Can you call him and see if we could all celebrate together?
<user0> He's playing in the PGA Championship right now or I'm sure he'd be delighted to, lol!
<user1> Well yeah, that sounds about right. He has to go to the Championship first and win, then party time !!!!!
<user0> You got it! I've been watching him play for a while now and it's such a fantastic feeling to see him win - and in his own country too!
<user1> It is really could to see friends live out their dreams! I will be cheering for him and the team!
<user0> Thank you - he'd appreciate it. It makes tournaments so much more interesting when you know some people involved.
<user0> That's sound like a lot of fun! Do you know where I can go get lessons?
<user1> There are skydiving centers all over the world.  What part of the country are you in?  It is an amazing sport.
<user0> I am in VA. I have been looking into it for quite awhile, but I think I'd be too chicken to jump out of the plane.
<user1> There is Skydive Orange and Virginia Skydiving Center.  I grew up near Richmond!
<user1> Nothing wrong with that. I'm definitely with you on the organizational front. I bet they're not laughing when you get them out of a jam!
<user0> Exactly!  I always joke that I use to be a boyscout b/c their motto is "Always be prepared"
<user1> It drives me nuts when people are disorganized. My husband is hopeless - I could throttle him sometimes!
<user1> Oh man that is really annoying!  Have you found another one you like yet?
<user0> Yes, but it's an apartment and this place was a lovely quiet 3 bed/2 bath place in a lovely neighborhood. Such a bummer!
<user1> Oh man I would be so upset.  I totally understand!  I hope you will be able to enjoy your new place
<user0> I'm sure I will so long as I have good neighbors. I'm over the first place now, but it wasn't pleasant to be pipped at the post!
<user0> Oh no! Do you know why?
<user1> yeah the vet told us it was cancer i was really sad
<user0> Aw, I'm sorry. I hope you get another horse that can at least help to replace that hole!
<user0> Do you know he is coming, or is it just blind luck?
<user1> i know he is comming i just like to be there couple of mins before he arrives
<user0> That is very considerate of you, I bet he really appreciates that.
<user0> Wow. That is quite an accomplishment! Congratulations!
<user1> yeah it really took a lot of hard work to do it but it was worth it at the end
<user0> What was is your doctorate in?
<user1> in science of medicine it was really a fun exppirience
<user1> what has she been doing? undercover CIA agent?
<user0> No, taking a language course to help her graduate studies.  Good guess though :P
<user1> *wink* *wink* 
<user1> Ha, yeah gotta make sure the house is back up to wife code before she gets home... other wise there's going to be a price to pay.
<user0> Most definitely.  I'm not worried about her being terribly mad, but it's nice to come home to a clean house.
<user1> It always is, plus it gives you some brownie points as well.
<user1> I am sorry to hear that, my wife has done the same thing. She wore a hat for almost a month when she left the house.
<user0> yeah it is the worst, i loook so weird with my hair like this it is so embarassing 
<user1> Well, like I told her, it will grow out, it will just take time.
<user1> That doesn't sound good. What happened that was so bad?
<user0> The food was pretty bad and the service didn't help clear things up.  There were a lot of mistakes on top of everything.  Just general bad eating out things.
<user1> That sounds like an awful experience. I probably wouldn't go back there anytime soon.
<user1> Oh lord. Did you try to set it back up, or did you try to sneak away?
<user0> It was too much of a mess to clean up and I couldn't sneak away because there were several people who saw me do it. My face was bright red.
<user1> Oh no, that's really embarrassing! Hopefully they let you off easy since it was just an accident.
<user1> I know you're happy 😊
<user0> Definitely :)  It's been a long and lonely summer :)
<user1> I feel ya, lonely indeed.
<user1> That sucks. Why did you move from california?
<user0> My rent tripled in three years. I couldn't afford to stay - just too expensive. Anyway, a friend had driven across with me and it wasn't until he'd gone that I realized I was alone. Silly, huh?!
<user1> That's really common actually. There's a big exodus from there.  They voted for high taxes and now people are abandoning the state beacuse the cost of living is too high.
<user0> The two things I found that were really bad were rents and gas. Everything else was pretty much the same as other places I've lived. So sad - where I lived was lovely.
<user1> The weather is nice in parts of california, I've been there.
<user0> The North is my favorite area - north of San Francisco. Where did you go?
<user1> My sister got married at Laguna niguel
<user1> That is a long trip.  Did you do it all in one go or did you take breaks?
<user0> It took about 5 days. I would drive a few hours and stop for the night. I'd already made the trip from West to East, so kind of knew what I was doing.
<user1> That's not bad, I was thinking you were doing it in like a couple days.
<user0> Oh no - I'm not a race car driver, lol. And anyway, it's kind of fun seeing different parts of the country, so rushing would (to me) be a waste.
<user0> Oh, poor lady. I do hope she's feeling better. What was wrong with her, if you don't mind my asking?
<user1> Not completely sure, maybe just a stomach bug or something.  She's ok now, though her appetite took a bit to come back.
<user0> Well, I'm really glad to hear she's recovered. Stomach bugs are awful - they really take their toll on you.
<user0> Why was it boring, nothing exciting to do where you live?
<user1> not really, i just stayed home all summer because my parents worked the whole summer as well as i did
<user0> Ah yeah, that sucks. No time for anything fun.
<user0> What kind of operation is it? I'm unfamiliar with weight loss surgery. But typically surgeries like that are very safe, but it is natural to feel nervous about someone you care about.
<user1> She is having gastric bypass surgery, I feel like it would be too dangerous due to her medical state. She wont listen to me!
<user0> Well, everyone is entitled to their own life choices. I'm sure she'll be alright.
<user0> Yeah, that's never fun. Did you lose at something recently?
<user1> not recently but gettting last at a race really makes me angry and motivates me
<user0> I agree, it makes you just want to try harder next time.
<user0> That's great, what specifically has made it so good for you?
<user1> I found out a got a pay raise at my job, we are starting to plan a cruise for the holidays in November!
<user0> Wow that all sounds very exciting, congratulations!
<user0> thats so sad oh no! thats terrible. :( 
<user1> I know, it made me upset! My two dogs are my babies couldn't imagine loosing them.
<user0> They are honestly just like children so its really sad. 
<user0> Awww, I totally know that feeling. I hate even going on vacation and not being able to bring my dog along. She is family!
<user1> yeah i am really looking forward to getting him back
<user0> I can imagine! Is he doing okay?
<user0> It must have been! Have you guys been apart before?
<user1> Not for more than a few days.  It's been a rough couple months, but it's almost over!
<user0> Ah so you've gone through it a couple of months alrready. How much longer is she going to be away for?
<user0> You must be so thankful!
<user1> We are.  They've helped a lot during my life, but this might have been the biggest one.
<user0> They are really wonderful. Do you have plans to show how thankful you are?
<user0> When will you be going ?
<user1> in a couple of weeks i am really happy to see them it has been 5 years
<user0> Wow, I hope you have a really nice trip.
<user0> just cause of the way they look or you had an incident involving one?
<user1> not really i was just born afraid of them hahah
<user0> yea im right there with you on that one along with snakes heh
<user0> That sounds like a pleasant surprise! 
<user1> It really was!  I walked into my apartment to like 15 more people than I expected.
<user0> Thats so sweet of her and what a great memory to have! 
<user0> That's a terrible waste of food, how old is your little brother?
<user1> he is like 11 but he does it when my parents are not home it is really anoying
<user0> Well, I hope he soon sees that is not something that he should be doing.
<user0> That's brutal, did she get out?
<user1> Yeah, we both stopped and pulled over.  I think she was high or something, she was really off.
<user0> Did she have insurance?
<user0> Awful! did you complaint?
<user1> yeah i did, they gave us a refund and we did not come back to that place again
<user0> Food should be made hygiene. We shouldn't compromise on health.
<user0> That's annoying, was it garlic bread?
<user1> It wasn't even garlic bread! It was generic bread to dip in soup! 
<user0> What did you say to him after he did it?
<user0> How so?
<user1> my boy friend gives me a birthday gift surprisingly 
<user0> That's awesome!  I love getting surprises!  
<user0> That's so sad.  I've lost dogs before.  I know how you feel :(
<user1> Yeah. I used to see him when I was out on my porch and he'd come out for a sniff around or a tinkle. He was so sweet and gentle.
<user0> Yeah dogs are man's best friend.
<user1> They sure are. I actually prefer them to some humans I know! Do you have a dog at the moment?
<user0> Yes I've got one.  She's a stray that showed up to work one day.
<user1> That's wonderful, that you were able to take her in. Good for you! More people should act like that.
<user0> She's been a great dog. I've got no complaints or regrets.
<user0> Oh wow haha that's not good
<user1> He was putting chocolate right into the chilli the other night! 
<user0> That's an interesting combination, maybe you should try to keep him out of the kitchen
<user0> What grade is he in?
<user1> In 7th and they're doing pre algebra. He said he didn't know it, then proceeded to get every question right!
<user0> Awesome! That had to be a great confidence boost for him! 
<user0> That's amazing! How long have you been running?
<user1> For a few months now, but I've been training pretty hard just these past few months.
<user0> That's pretty cool. I hope you win!
<user0> I'm right there with you.. I still feel pretty introverted, but since coming to college, I've been forced to socialize more, and it's help me at least "fake it until I make it." I still prefer to be alone a lot of the time, but at least I can somewhat manage without making myself look dumb. Maybe you can just think of some topics/things to talk about to have in the back of your head for the times when things get quiet?
<user1> that's a great idea! thank you for a great advice. 
<user0> I hope it goes well! If it makes you feel any better, most of them are probably just as nervous and are looking for any excuse to relax and let their guard down, too. Good luck
<user0> That sounds awesome. Have you ever been before?
<user1> Not that particular one, no. I had butterflies in my stomach on that elevator going down 23 stories.
<user0> I wish I could go sometime that sounds like quite the experience.
<user1> Overall it was a good time, but i was nervous being that far underground, i need to learn to relax and enjoy things.
<user1> How'd it turn out? Congrats on deciding to lead a healthier life, by the way.
<user0> I decided to focus on the music that was blasting, just tried switching up what I play in the gym, it sounds like vikings are bringing me into battle
<user1> I'm the exact same way in the gym. Music is a huge motivator for me. One time my phone died while in the gym and the rest of the workout was so low energy.
<user1> Yeah I have, it wasn't serious but I got rearended
<user0> I got T-boned once, I'll never forget spinning around in that car, hearing the tires squalling. It was really scary.
<user1> That's terrifying, I'm so glad you're okay
<user1> That is very sad. Did something recently happen to her? 
<user0> Shes lost a lot of loved ones this summer. We've been to 4 funerals, and the most recent one was really hard on her.
<user1> That is absolutely horrible. I hope she has a moment of happiness very soon. No one should have to deal with that much loss. 
<user1> Death by a thousand cuts, I call it! They'll try to make a buck off anything!
<user0> Very true. They didn't even tell me. That was the last thing I expected! I only just decided to use it again.
<user1> Did you try talking to them about it? I can only assume it wouldn't go well but you never know.
<user0> Yes. They said that they'd been taken over by another bank and it was the previous one which deducted the money. What rubbish. It just amazes me!
<user0> Yes, I have.  One that actually died and one that was miraculously saved.  It was a dark and tough time.  Did that happen to you recently?
<user1> Yes, my brother in law/childhood friend took his own life. Its been very hard to comes to terms with.
<user0> I am soo soo very sorry.  Its so hard to understand everything surrounding a suicide so its hard to be at peace about something that didn't have to happen.  I pray you and your family will find closure and fight for awareness for people who are struggling with those feelings.
<user0> Yeah, I have. Do you?
<user1> Yeah, he keeps pooping in the floor! He's learning to go outside, but I'm so tired of stepping in doggy poo at 3am!
<user0> It happens. Hope your dog will poop outside soon.
<user0> Always sucks when you forget to save it and wake up to a melted blob of brown.
<user1> Last night I wasn't in a great mood and wanted that last piece to help cheer me up a bit and it was gone! 
<user0> Oh wow! I HATE when you get the urge to eat something and then you get to the fridge only to realize it's gone. Do you know who ate it?
<user0> Thats horrible! You should tell them as that is their property. What if someone did that to your stuff?
<user1> I agree, I felt so bad about it. When I saw him replacing it, I went out and confessed.
<user0> GOOD on you!!
<user0> I know how you feel, financial problems are rough. I know you'll figure out a way to make it.
<user1> thank you for your support! and to make things worse i broke a ceiling light yesterday and we are renting this apartment so i have to replace it and it's expensive
<user0> That really stinks! Don't worry too much though, things will work out.
<user0> That's awesome, what was in it?
<user1> Photos from my whole life growing up, with sections about my relationships with each sibling. pretty awesome.
<user0> You must be happy to have it back, those are the best memories.
<user0> Ugh! I hate it when stuff like that happens. Were you able to get a refund on your tickets?
<user1> No. We went ahead and went on. It actually turned out to be a great trip with zero incidents. 
<user0> Awesome!!
<user1> Yeah. Glad we didnt bail.
<user0> That is very true! Was it bad weather?
<user1> No. Best I can remember it didnt even rain.
<user1> i hate that too, what were you going to do?
<user0> I was going to Florida to go on a multi-day canoeing and camping trip. At the last minute, the two people I was going with backed out, and I simply couldn't afford to go alone.
<user1> Maybe I could come with you, I'm near Florida.
<user1> Why don't you believe him? He made have been quite the big name back in his day.
<user0> I don't know if he was famous, but the other day, he got on stage, bit the head off of a bat, then belted the words to Crazy Train. It was unbelievable!
<user1> Wow, that sounds amazing. I wish I could have seen that!
<user1> That sounds interesting.  What kinds?
<user0> well, one time we had to replace the subfloor where a man had died and his cats had started to eat him. was revolting.
<user1> Oh that's awful!
<user1> Is that like the child equivalent of under the bed?
<user0> I guess so haha but no matter what I try to keep him from doing it, it still happens
<user1> That's kinda strange. I assume that's something he'll grow out of.  How old is he?
<user1> Wow, that took some guts! What made you want to cut it?
<user0> It was kind of scraggly on the ends. It took me some time to get used to the new cut, but it looks much thicker and healthier now.
<user1> And just think about how much you're saving on shampoo and conditioner!
<user1> Ahhhh! I've done that before, but I noticed it quick.  Did you not know til the end of the day?
<user0> Yep! No one told me. :( I have no idea how many people noticed or saw it. 
<user1> That's embarrassing, ah, I'm sorry.  Just play it off tomorrow at work! 
<user1> Please tell me it was not full of Oriental Trading Company rubber ducks and cheap tchotchkes.
<user0> I would've happily taken that! Instead, it was filled with literal garbage, like a bunch of those empty 99 Bananas bottles and candy wrappers.
<user1> Oh man! I feel bad for laughing but "literal garbage" is pretty funny. That sucks, can you report them to eBay?
<user1> How did you do?
<user0> I'm pretty sure I Aced it! I've been studying for weeks.
<user1> That's good. I was never good at chemistry
<user1> I understand, anything you need to talk about?
<user0> You are sweet because part of the problem is when I realize there really is no one to talk to. Thank you
<user1> Buck up little camper.
<user1> How is she doing
<user0> She's doing great, especially for her second week on the job!
<user1> I am happy for you and her
<user1> i can't believe christmas is in 4 months it's crazy
<user0> I know, it's my favourite time of year! Makes me happy :)
<user1> mine is the fall. halloween, thanksgiving....what's not to love.
<user1> well the casino won! did you at least get some free drinks?
<user0> Haha, yeah I got a little sauced. The worst part though was as soon as I got up, someone sat down and  rolled triple 7s.
<user1> hah.. at least you had fun it sounds like
<user1> I do hate when the lights are off too
<user0> Yeah, so I would book it up the stairs as fast as possible
<user1> I am sure I would too. Just be careful
<user1> I am happy for you. Are you excited?
<user0> Yeah, I'm really hoping to make a good impression. Other wise that would feel pretty bad.
<user1> I bet you will be fine. Just be yourself
<user1> Are you ready for it?
<user0> I have been preparing for weeks, but in the back of my mind I still have doubts.
<user1> I am sure you will do well
<user1> That must be annoying for you, but I love cats.
<user0> I love him, too, a lot. But I don't know why he just stands in the hallway and meows nonstop, even when he's been fed.
<user1> What is his name?
<user0> Ashe. He's cute :)
<user0> Oh that's great! Congratulations on your upcoming finish!
<user1> Thank you. :) I only have three classes left to take. I'm so excited. 
<user0> That's amazing. I wish you the best of luck with the remaining classes!
<user1> Thanks a lot ;)
<user1> Ohh what happened?
<user0> When I was a teenager, I called in to the restaurant and told them I had to pick up my grandmother from an aiport hours away. Wouldn't you know it my family came in (including my grandma) and asked to be sat in my section!
<user1> Sometimes things like these happens. Don't worry. But playing hookey is a fun though
<user1> I know exactly what you mean.  It gets so lonely on the road.  Have you had to go away recently?
<user0> This was a while back, but I planned a bicycle trip that went across several states. Although I had a buddy coming with me originally, he ended up bailing and I went alone. I called it quits halfway.
<user1> That's still quite a long ride.  Do you do a lot of long distance biking? 
<user1> on to the next one, as they say!
<user0> I'm trying to figure out how to kick her out of my place.
<user1> have the new chick there when she comes home
<user1> Oh yeah.  I've never seen it, I can't watch horror films.  How did you like it?
<user0> I can't even sleep with the lights off now for the last few days.
<user1> Ohhh boy.  I hope you have a person or an animal to snuggle up to to help you feel better.
<user1> That's scary when that happens
<user0> Yeah it is. I thought I was about to die lol
<user1> Some people DO die from choking, be safe!
<user1> Why is that?
<user0> Because I had also stolen some candy and wanted to get out as soon as possible.
<user1> Oh that makes sense, well be careful
<user1> Whoa, that is scary! Did you know him?
<user0> I did not know him. He took some items from the house as I didn't have any money on me
<user1> I am glad that you are okay!
<user1> Hahaha, sounds kind of like clickbait
<user0> Exactly, I started taping my mouth closed at night, finally woke up before noon, mission accomplished
<user1> Hahahaha, that's so funny
<user1> That is weird but amazing! Does it work?  If it does, I will get my husband to tape his mouth shut.  He snores like a freight train because his tongue slides back I guess.  Is that true for you?
<user0> Yeah, it
<user1> Do you have any advice on what kind of tape?
<user0> I use band aid tape cuz it's okay on the skin
<user0> That sounds like a nice time!
<user1> It was, but not just because of a romantic walk. When we arrived, there was a festival with games, performances and a fireworks display after sunset! It was incredible!
<user0> Wow that worked out perfectly
<user0> Did you go over and ask them to turn down the volume?
<user1> No, I'm shy and try to avoid confrontation as much as possible
<user0> Well, I hope you have some really good earphones - or that they quiet down - it's a big egotistical to think that no one around you cares when you are that loud.
<user0> I know what you mean. Once I had a bank where the teller's literally had butts for heads. It was so distracting trying to talk to them.
<user1> That sounds truly bizarre! I guess I am still angry because the other day they froze my card, and due to a teller's mistake actually had to take my current card and mail me a new one!
<user0> Well it was an upgrade from the bank I had where the tellers were actually robots. I can't believe the cost-cutting measures in place today!
<user0> wow  thats nostalgic!!. It must have brought back lot of good memories
<user1> Yes, playing the machine we built together reminded me of all the good times we used to have.
<user0> does the machine is in good condition now?
<user0> What happened?
<user1> I just started to feel a sharp pain in one of my teeth. It might be a cavity or something worse
<user0> Are they going to pull the tooth?
<user0> Thats not strange at all
<user1> I'm glad you don't think so. The kicker is, when I got to the front of the line the guy in front of me got the last two tickets!
<user0> That sucks. What did you do?
<user0> Oh no, the poor girl. Was she able to walk afterwards?
<user1> Unfortunately, it swelled up and she was in no shape to go anywhere. So instead, I stayed with her and watched netflix while we split a pint of icecream.
<user0> You're a terrific partner. You guys can do something outdoors next time, right?
<user0> hahaha why was it underwhelming?
<user1> I guess because furry things don't really scare me, I was like well that was a waste of a reaction
<user0> lol how do you feel about spiders?
<user0> Why were you getting mad?  Were you not lifting as much as you wanted?
<user1> No not really, just seeing how much energy I could summon from within
<user0> I see,  I do that too sometimes.  It helps with motivation
<user0> You are good at generalizing aren't you?
<user1> Yeah, what am I getting myself into
<user0> I have no clue.. really I don't!
<user0> how much did you win?
<user1> Close to $20,000, I think I'm going to spend it on traveling.
<user0> Thats sounds like a fun trip or 8
<user0> that sounds cool.
<user1> It was an adaptation of "The Last Unicorn". It had parts that took place in the water, and parts that took place on a giant trapeze!
<user0> Wow. I would love to see something like that
<user0> What did you name her?
<user1> I named her Layla.
<user0> Thats so cute!
<user0> Oh you must have enjoyed it!!
<user1> Yeah, it was awesome reminiscing about those times when we used to get in trouble back in the day... times were so much simpler then.
<user0> Yeah indeed it must have been then
<user0> So cute! What kind of dog is it?
<user1> It is a german shepherd. It takes a lot of work caring for it, definitely needs a lot of attention
<user0> That's amazing, I wish I could get a puppy too, but my cat is not friendly
<user0> That's crazy did you ever get it back?
<user1> No! I am so furious with that goose, that I could wring his neck! I can't get any ladiez with this chrome dome of mine.
<user0> I am so sorry maybe you will have better luck next time.
<user0> Eww, it may be time to call someone to take care of them.
<user1> I almost fell over trying to crush it, i forgot I wasn't wearing shoes and stepped on in with my bare feet.
<user0> Oh, that had to be super gross! 
<user0> How creepy!
<user1> Every time I turned around to try and catch something there was nothng there. Just the feeling of something watching me....
<user0> At least nothing happened to yo
<user0> That's rough. Did you end up getting the job?
<user1> I did not get it unfortunately. 
<user0> Well, there's always next time. At least you can chalk it up as a learning experience.
<user0> That's strange. What did you discover under there?
<user1> Well, when I went to lift the engine cover, I noticed a dead, rotting squirrel on top of the engine block! It was so repulsive.
<user0> Oh my! That is repulsive indeed! I would've taken it home for dinner. Waste not want not!
<user0> Oh NO!  Are you okay?
<user1> Yeah, it was more of a shock than anything, was not expecting someone to hit you when you are just crossing the street.
<user0> Yeah I bet!  Did they stop and check on you?
<user0> Oh yeah? Is it on par with "I Have a Dream"?
<user1> I can only dream. No it's more on par with Lord of the RIng's final battle.
<user0> Woah now! I wasn't thinking of a speech on that grand of a scale! I hope you blow Gimli's beard clean off his face and make 20 horns of Gondor sound!
<user0> wow that was really nice of them
<user1> Yeah, I was in a huge hurry and didn't have much but I really needed to make it to the bank before it closed.
<user0> Most people now a days won't do that. Make sure to pay it forward!
<user0> That's great, man! Did you study hard for it?
<user1> I reviewed all the homework and the test questions mostly had the same problems on them. I didn't feel like I understood how to do the problems but I remembered the answers.
<user0> Well, that's all that matters! Just gotta pass those exams!
<user0> Aw, that's awesome, did it bring back memories?
<user1> It was pretty nostalgic , how young we all looked growing up.
<user0> Yeah, it's always nice to take a look back and reflect on the early days.
<user0> Nice! Who did you go see? Did you catch a homerun?
<user1> It was the Rockies, no home-run though, it was pretty high up there I felt like I could see the world.
<user0> That sounds amazing. All I have is my lowly Senators sea level stadium...I am mad jealous.
<user0> Oh dang. Was she a hoarder? What did you find?
<user1> You hit it right on the money. She was not only a hoarder but a cat lady, and the mix of paper, bugs and cat feces was an affront to the senses.
<user0> I can't even imagine the stench...did you make out with any buried treasure?
<user0> Oh that's terrible.  Is he alright?
<user1> Yeah he is fine and my car was not damaged. My insurance premium is probably going to go up though.
<user0> That really stinks that that happens.  Are you pretty upset about it?
<user1> He said he would cover the extra costs so I'm not too upset
<user1> I do love a smooth ride. What kind of car is it?
<user0> It's a Chevrolet Camaro.
<user1> That's awesome! I am mad jealous that you have my dream car!
<user1> Wow, you were dedicated, did you do well on it?
<user0> I did, and I was accepted to my number 1 program, which meant that I was going to be paid to learn!
<user1> Congratulations, all the hard work paid off!
<user0> I have a feeling the really hard work might just be beginning, but I feel exceptionally lucky.
<user0> That must of been pretty stressful. But did you get enough sleep?
<user1> I did. I was able to sneak in a few hours here and there.
<user0> Sleep is just as important as studying hard. You can kill your performance without it.
<user0> That's terrible! Did you get it back with everything still inside?
<user1> I was able to get back in and find it, it was pretty well hidden in between the seats. No harm no foul.
<user0> At least you have a happy ending for that story.
<user0> I agree. I think I am one of them, considering I gave my whole life savings to charity yesterday.
<user1> That's incredible if true, but I have trouble believing you for some reason. I was talking about some stranger who gave my friend 3 free tickets to a rock concert - we had such a blast!
<user0> That's really great, but I swear it was true! It was a whole 50 cents. Looking back on it, I am kinda sad I did it because now I can't buy that fancy fidget spinner at the supermarket. Hopefully some orphan uses it wisely.
<user0> That's good to hear, what did she do to make you proud?
<user1> She performed her first solo dance in competition, but she had been in leg braces for the last 2 years.
<user0> Oh wow! That's amazing, i'm sure that was a really touching moment!
<user1> It was, very much so, I will cherish it forever.
<user1> Sorry to hear that. Maybe you can talk with your boss about changing the schedule a bit.
<user0> Well, I've worked without a break for the last 3 years, I just want to get away abit.
<user1> Wow, that is a long time! That shows how dedicated you are to your job, and that you deserve some time off!
<user0> Right! I'd like to go lay on a beach, or even just the next town over at this point.
<user0> That is awesome.  What are you hoping to do?
<user1> I am an electrical engineering student, and I am interested in quite a few things at this point. I think after this year, I will be able to get a paid internship next summer!
<user0> That's the dream, to get paid in college.  I wish I could have done that.  Congratulations!
<user0> Are you cleaning out a house or do you not have garbage pick-up?
<user1> The company in my city just quit picking up for any of the residents, so the dump has a line every day.
<user0> That is insane! I've never heard of anything like that before.  You all should start protesting!
<user1>  We have, and we called a city meeting. I'm just beyond words,it has to be corrected.
<user1> Oh really? What was it they served?
<user0> I should have known better, as these friends are on the "crunchier side". They had a loaf of bread that they made with flour that had cockroaches added to it!
<user1> Oh wow... I really can't imagine eating it knowing it had those in it.
<user0> I lost my appetite completely! I will be sure to get takeout before hand if we ever go to another one of their dinners.
<user0> I hope she hears some good news. Is it pretty serious?
<user1> She had stage 3 cancer, but she was clear last screening a year ago.
<user0> I'll be praying for her, I hope she continues to stay in the clear in the future.
<user1> Thank you, I have a good feeling about it.
<user1> Oh no, it's awful something happens on that special day that should be full of joy and whatnot.
<user0> Yeah, his wife got drunk and paid a pass at me. I told her to sober up, and let him know what had happened.
<user1> Yikes. Well, at least you did the right thing by passing that long, as painful as it might have been. 
<user1> am sorry about that, what are others doing about it
<user0> Not much. It's all on me. It sucks
<user1> sorry, just tryy to be patient with them
<user1> Old school video games are full nostalgic memories for me. That is why i try to avoid them as they evoke many emotions in me
<user0> For me it's happy emotions
<user1> It is just that I miss my friends a lot with whom i used to play. I wish i could just rewind time and go back
<user1> I love beer! I wish I could try your guy's beer.  Is it a hard process?
<user0> We actually don't brew our own, and hadn't been able to try many because we live in a small town. But we just got the news that a micro brewery was opening here in a few weeks!
<user1> Awesome, that's great news!  Hope you guys make a great tasting one and become big!
<user1> ooh, you should not be, she should be appreciated for looking good
<user0> She's for my eyes only. At least she doesn't pay them any attention. Or I would flip!
<user1> aha, thats funny though
<user1> Oh, I haven't read it, but I was also sad to hear he passed
<user0> He started from the bottom and worked his way up. He had a passion for people as well as food, and we all still look up to him.
<user1> Yes, too bad he was struggling with his depression and couldn't seek help
<user1> Aw, that's so nice of them! Was it fun?
<user0> Yes, it was a lot of fun and it caught me off guard. It meant a lot that they did it for me.
<user1> That's great! It's so nice that you have people around you who care
<user1> Ohhh..I would love that experience! How special!
<user0> I enjoy helping the wildlife in our area. It is alway a good feeling to give a helping hand.
<user1> I love that too! I try feeding everyone :) Awesome!
<user1> Oh geez! Why was she gone for so long?
<user0> She was taking a language course in Germany for her graduate studies.
<user1> That's pretty cool! That would be hard though! Were you all able to talk a lot?
<user1> How long have you been there ?
<user0> About a year and a half. I really didn't expect him to say that - we don't know each other that well.
<user1> Sometimes we affect people that we don't realize.
<user0> Very true. I do pet his dog when I see them. Perhaps he recognizes a fellow dog-lover!
<user0> That doesn't seem fair. How are they getting around not paying you for it?
<user1> I'm technically salaried, so I don't get paid overtime. It's still really irritating. 
<user0> It sounds like your boss needs to be more considerate when it comes to his employees.
<user0> Wow, did you ever get them in trouble?
<user1> Sadly, no.  There's no actual proof of who it was, but we've seen them doing random stuff like that all over the place.  He did have the cops called on him for unrelated things once, so I'll take that as a victory.
<user0> There you go, take victories where you can get them!
<user0> Great, what is his field ?
<user1> He is currently Active Duty Army, but is wanting to go into transportation/logistics. 
<user0> I see. I hope for all the best for you and him.
<user0> Sounds super relaxing! I bet your enjoying it!
<user1> Yes I am, about to make some soup for lunch. This day has been just what I needed!
<user0> Thats awesome! What kind of soup do you make?
<user0> My brother just graduated and is on the job hunt, and he's described his experience as the same thing.. Seems like he has good interviews and they're receptive to him, but they don't really respond or give him an answer. Sorry to hear you guys go through that. Can't imagine how frustrating it is
<user1> Super frustrating.  It worked out in the end, but I had to bug them a few times to make sure they hadn't abandoned me.
<user0> Good on you for being aggressive and opportunistic. Maybe they found that to be the motivating factor to give you the job. I hope it's been good so far.
<user0> That sounds like so much fun!
<user1> I know - I wish I could do that. They've been to France, Italy, Croatia and Chile so far - I'm sitting in NC!
<user0> I totally get why you feel that way.  Your time will come soon.
<user1> I would just like to be able to drive to Raleigh without hurting! I fell and broke my hip a while back and can't walk properly.
<user0> I hope you can recover soon!
<user1> One more operation and I should be good. In the meantime, I have to live vicariously through Joe and Helen :)
<user1> That's good! I bet you missed her a lot.
<user0> I really did.  It'll be great to have her back :)
<user1> I'm sure she'll have a lot to tell you about her trip!
<user1> That's a long time to kind of hang in limbo. I am sorry you had to endure that for a month.
<user0> It worked out ok, but I had to keep bugging them to make sure they hadn't given up on me.
<user1> Well, at least that story had a happy ending. It could have went much worse.
<user1> Aw, I bet you miss her a lot.
<user0> I do.  She's getting back soon, but it's been tough being along with the dogs every night.
<user1> Well, at least the dogs still have you for company. I'm sure you'll be happy when she gets back though.
<user1> What kind of job is it?
<user0> A lab technician at a university.
<user1> Interesting! What kind of things do you do?
<user1> aw man that sucks how come he gets to get one but not you
<user0> I have no idea. He's the "golden child." It's super unfair.
<user1> well after a certain age parent's start to treat children differently lol
<user1> when does she return?
<user0> She gets back in a week, so it's almost over.
<user1> well thats good
<user1> Did you go running like crazy!? 
<user0> heck yes i did! I locked myself in the room and told him he needs to kill that thing before he goes to work
<user1> i would have done the same glad no one got stung! 
<user1> They are bad now too, they are so annoying
<user0> yes i hate going out when it is rainny season there is so many of them
<user1> It can be irritating to deal with this time of year
<user1> Come on, the worst that can happen is that it kills you.
<user0> Exactly!!!! Isn't that enough to fear them?!
<user1> It's certainly a good enough reason to kill them.
<user1> Wow, are you nervous at all
<user0> A little bit, but I love doing extreme stuff like this.
<user1> That's exciting. I'd never have the guts to do it so kudos to you.
<user1> That kind of stinks. Sorry to hear that! Well, at least there are worst things to forget outside.. Maybe this is an easy learning lesson!
<user0> It was gross though when I went to go and get it! It was all full of bugs! 
<user1> I didn't even think of that! That's one thing about tea with me, that I've never gotten into it because you get it and it's so hot, so you have to wait forever to drink it. You set it down and then ultimately forget it!
<user1> Yikes that sounds scary but overall good for the end results. How do you feel about it? 
<user0> Nervous. Surgery is a big step and I'm afraid something will go wrong.
<user1> I understand i would be too but now a days technology is really good just make sure its a reliable hospital! 
<user0> You're absolutely correct and the hospital's one of the best in the country. Still, I fret about it. I should just get on with it!
<user0> That's a good friend you got there.
<user1> she is wonderful! She helped me out so many times i don't know what i would do withiut her
<user0> Never take someone like that for granted. They are so rare.
<user0> What types of situations are you referring to?
<user1> Usually they just interupt with a ring. But Youtube is on my lock screen and it played out loud while I was inline, and it was not an appropriate topic!
<user0> lol, did everyone around you make funny faces?
<user1> Of course they did, some guy in this video was dropping the f bomb out of no where. I was humiliated,lol.
<user1> I am so sorry to hear that. Was she able to go surrounded by you guys?
<user0> Yes, she had cancer so we knew she was going to pass soon. My daughter won't stop crying.
<user1> It's hard to lose a family member like that. You guys should take some time to grieve.
<user1> Where did they go?
<user0> they went to the beach for 1 week
<user1> That sounds like so much fun!
<user1> That's great!  I've got to deal with loud neighbors too.  Anything specific they do?
<user0> Stomp around at all times of the day and night, screeching into their cellphones and playing loud video games. What do yours do?
<user1> Loud running toddler who pitches fits at random times, day or night.  Sounds like a similar level of noise :P
<user0> Eww. Yes, it is loud. Who would live in an upstairs apartment with a small child? That's nuts!
<user0> Oh wow, I bet you can't wait! I remember when I had to spend a summer overseas and it was awful to be away from my husband.
<user1> It sure is.  It's just been me and the dogs all summer, I've gotten super bored :P
<user0> Well, she'll be back soon and you'll have loads of catching up to do. I bet the dogs missed her too!
<user0> Could you elaborate as to why?
<user1> I had such a huge spider ran past me in the bathroom. I am so grossed out by all the bugs here!
<user0> Oh no could you call an exterminator?
<user1> Spiders could bite me, which could really hurt!
<user1> I'm sure you'll do great!  How long have you been training?
<user0> for this specific game for about 3 months
<user1> Wow, that's a lot of dedication!  I believe in you!
<user1> i can imagine, i have been there and it is the worst just belive in yourself
<user0> It's gotten better now, but it could still get even better.  Just got to keep on moving.
<user1> yeah it always gets bbbetter that is the good thing
<user1> That sounds like fun! I've always wanted to visit India.
<user0> yeah i have been planning this trip for over 2 years
<user1> Nice. I hope you have a great time!
<user1> That sounds like a relief.
<user0> It was. I can't even brush my teeth at 8am without one or the other of them thumping around upstairs.
<user1> It seems like it's a lot of ruckus, I've visited friends who have your situation and I can only imagine. 
<user0> That blessed week was so peaceful and calming. Everything felt right in my world. Then they came back!
<user1> Glad you enjoyed that short period of peace. Maybe soon you will get new neighbors or you can get a better place.
<user0> Getting a new apartment soon. At least the new neighbors will hopefully be at work during the day.
<user1> Oh, good. I'm sure it will be an improvement from your current situation.
<user1> Omg i would have been so embarrassed! :O 
<user0> It was very embarrassing! At least I didn't go the whole day like that.
<user1> thats true imagine if you had! it takes a lot of talent tho to put your pants on inside out and still manage to button them. ha ha 
<user1> that is awesome, i hope that happens to me on my next trip, where where you going
<user0> Home, but I thought LA would be crowded even at 4am, it made the hair on my arms stand up it was so creepy.
<user1> well you are really lucky to have an empty airport
<user0> Made getting my connection super easy, and trust me I was in a hurry to get there. Odd how being alone can make you paranoid.
<user0> I would go mad, were you away at college or in the service?
<user1> college, but i will be seeing him very soon i think
<user0> That is great, I am sure he misses you and will be so happy to see you. He will smell you coming and know your there even before you get in the door.
<user0> That's not silly at all! I'm sure he'll love it.
<user1> I hope so should be home really soon.  Can't wait to hear all about it.  IT goes by to fast!
<user0> Yeah, he'll be all grown up before you know it!
<user1> I know my oldest just graduated,  It was like it was over in an instant!
<user1> Did it turn out how you expected it
<user0> It was even better then expected. It was very small, but so happy how it turned out.
<user1> I'm glad to hear... Weddings can be stressful
<user1> Maybe put the poop back on your neighbors yard?
<user0> hahaha i mean he does not do it often but it is not a bad idea
<user1> Its the only way to get them to learn
<user1> That's wonderful, it's always good when hard work pays off like that!
<user0> Yes it is and he is so devoted to God and living for Him. I was so happy for him.
<user1> I bet so that sounds nice
<user0> Thank you.
<user0> Oh wow, that sounds like it was a big mess.
<user1> Yes, and to make it worse, when I tried to clean it, she tried to eat, so she almost knocked me over too. I was not happy.
<user0> I hope she didn't eat too much of it, it might make her sick.
<user1> No, she only ate a little bit. I cleaned it up pretty quickly.
<user1> Oh yeah? Did you go give it a try?
<user0> I did! It was terrible! I was so upset! It was expensive, small, and bland! 
<user1> That's a shame. I hate it when a place doesn't live up to the hype.
<user1> That can be a bit uncomfortable for sure. Did you try and avoid conversations
<user0> If things got a bit much I'd excuse myself and go elsewhere. I didn't want to get into an argument, but wasn't going to compromise my own beliefs by lying.
<user1> If it gets to be too much be sure to walk away.
<user0> I became quite good at that - the great vanishing employee, lol. I'm all for earnest discussion, but not at work!
<user0> He must be really strong!
<user1> He is! I was so shocked but super attracted to him too! 
<user0> Sure,  I strong men is very attractive! You must be proud of him!
<user0> That is hard thing to go through. I hope you are feeling better about it now.
<user1> yeah i have been over it for sometime now but it is till hard to talk about
<user0> I bet. Losing a pet is much like losing a loved one. It gets better but still hurts sometime.
<user0> Aw, that sucks. But at least he got a job, right?
<user1> Yeah, and it's one he really wanted and enjoys. I'm really happy for him, but would have really liked to see him.
<user0> Well, hopefully he can schedule another time to come visit you.
<user1> I hope so. We always have such a good time and like a lot of the same things. Oh well, some other time.
<user1> Oh my. That is very unfortunate.
<user0> Yes, it hit our whole family very hard. That was in 2013, and sometimes I still pick up the phone to call her and tell her something.
<user1> I know that feeling. Im sure she is looking down on you all.
<user0> Thank you.
<user0> That must have been a little bit of a roller coaster. That's kind of why I'm not wild about cats, is because they're so independent, and the outside cats can just go hang out somewhere for days and not have a care in the world about you. But I guess that suits some people.
<user1> I found her on the side of the street with her guts hanging in the gutter. I was so upset and sad
<user0> Oh man.. so that was REALLY a roller coaster then. I'm so sorry.. I hope you're not overwhelming yourself with guilt about it. It sounds like something you could not have any control over.
<user0> My nephew is getting into golf! It seems like a cool enough sport, albeit a little expensive. I hope you're able to get back to playing again. I've taken up running and swimming, and it's interesting how much those physical activities relieve stress in our day.
<user1> It sure is! Good on your nephew - it's a great sport. And good for you, too. It's all too easy just to sit back. I have to force myself to do physical therapy so I can walk again!
<user0> Well, often people just give up and relegate themselves to just sitting in a chair and watching TV. Even if you have to force yourself, at least you are forcing yourself. At some point hopefully you will see progress and feel it getting easier. Once that happens, motivation starts to become real easy to get.
<user1> Just the thought of getting back on the golf course is enough to get me off the couch, lol.
<user1> I've never been skydiving myself. I hear that it's a great experience, but I'm not sure if I have the bravery for it.
<user0> I did not for many years, but my brother convinced me to tandem with him to celebrate our mothers remission.
<user1> Oh wow. Is it something that you would do again?
<user0> I think when my children are grown that I might, I would need to feel secure with the abilities of those in charge. You are putting your life in their hands.
<user0> Sounds like fund, you must be excited!
<user1> I am, I have been watching all my favorite movies. 
<user0> I think I will need to do that, my TV is an oldy.  I am sure you will have a great time.
<user1> I am, I think my wife is getting tired of all the time I am spending watching movies. 
<user1> That sounds horrible. I would not have been able to sleep after that.
<user0> I screamed so loud that I woke up my husband and he though we were being burgled! 
<user1> How terrifying. I hope you were able to find and kill it.
<user1> Well, it's okay to be a bit nervous. Interviewers will understand that. You only have to halfway reign in it in and you'll hit that happy medium that's good for a workplace interview. Where are you applying to?
<user0> a government position. Can't really say much. :) but I really hope i will get this job, they pay really good money
<user1> I bet you have a good shot at it! Good luck
<user1> Did you tell anyone about the dream?
<user0> I told my husband. The dream made me miss my best friend from high school.
<user1> You should call your best friend on the telephone!
<user0> I actually sent her a message through facebook.
<user1> That is sure to make you feel the nostalgic?
<user0> I guess that's a good word for it. 
<user0> oh that sounds like fun
<user1> Yeah, he is such a cutie. I have been playing with my new pup the rest of the day. 
<user0> sounds like a wonderful day!
<user1> It is, a day I will always remember. I named him spot, because he has a funny looking spot on his back. 
<user1> Oh My!! What are you going to do? I would buy it anyway. 
<user0> I may buy it still, but I have to save up more money now.
<user1> Well thats unfortunate. Hopefully you will be able to buy it soon. 
<user0> I hope so. I as so exited to be able to get it.
<user0> It happens to the best of us. It would be great if they did not make us gain weight.
<user1> It was sheer greed, I'm afraid. I know everyone has their moments, but I really shouldn't have done that.
<user0> Well you have to live a little every now and then. I'm sure it was worth it, haha.
<user1> It certainly was - German chocolate is delicious!
<user1> Oh no, poor baby
<user0> i know, i got some motrin, funny movies and lots of cuddles.i hope he will feel better tomorrow
<user1> Yes cuddles will help
<user1> That sounds really fun. Can you still remember some of the routines?
<user0> honestly, no, it's been 8 years haha loooong time ago! I wish i could hang out with all those people again
<user1> Yea that is a long time. You should reach out to some and see if they are on social media.
<user1> I'm fascinated by how people can watch golf, I always found it really boring, but if you enjoy it then great!
<user0> I've been around the game all my life and just love both playing and watching. I'd imagine that, if you don't play, it would be pretty boring!
<user1> Oh that totally changes things I guess, makes sense.
<user0> I think it's the format of this tournament that gets me addicted. It's not like regular tournaments, in that teams are playing against each other.
<user0> Aw that's terrible, at least you were able to comfort her?
<user1> Yes, I was able to make her feel better, and her daddy made her laugh. But my mama bear side came out, and I was ready to confront some people.
<user0> I'm sure you were! Those people deserved some confrontation for sure.
<user1> Yes, they did.
<user1> Oh my god! what did you do? did you tell anyone?
<user0> I called the cops! Turns out that it's bird bones! My cat has been killing bird after bird and leaving it in my garden! 
<user1> LOLOLOL the cops probably had a good laugh about that.
<user1> Me too!!! ii never could understand what drives people to be so mean to such innocent creatures. 
<user0> They're filthy, ignorant bullies. I would sentence them to life in prison, without parole!!!
<user1> Really!! I would go even further and give them the electric chair. I have no tolerance for those types of people. 
<user0> More laws need to be passed so they can be prosecuted. So many states have nothing on the statute books.
<user0> Oh, I hate it when that happens. Did you find out what it was?
<user1> It ended up just being a raccoon rummaging through our trash. But at the time we thought it was someone trying to break in. 
<user0> I'm glad it wasn't something dangerous. That would be a terrifying experience.
<user1> It would be, I worry for the safety of my family. 
<user1> You do? thats good, friends can be terrible people to lend too.
<user0> They can, but he was in a real bind and I was able to do so. I know he's grateful for the loan, so I reckon I'll be ok there.
<user1> I bet he pays you in full.
<user0> Even part would be ok. He needs to get a bunch of savings together so he doesn't find himself in that situation again.
<user0> I bet that was scary. Did he surprise you with something?
<user1> He did! He had set up a dinner table in a clearing in our yard right when the sun was setting. Dinner was ready and waiting and warm too! 
<user0> Ahhh. How nice. You are lucky to have such a thoughtful husband. 
<user0> Does it look like a space ship?
<user1> Well at night it's kind of hard to tell that it looks like anything. All you can see is just the blinking locator lights on it, and all you can hear is the buzzing of the props. But who knows what could be attached to the drone? Cameras? Some kind of gas?
<user0> I have never seen a drone flying around here. Even in the day time
<user0> What does she do?
<user1> like we were hanging out yesterday and my hysband called and i walked to a different room to talk to him and when i came back she started asking me questions about what he said and stuff likethat
<user0> Wow, I would just tell her its private. Sounds annoying
<user0> Aw I understand that, I have gone through that myself and it's very hard. When did this happen? 
<user1> Over the summer, he started acting strange so we took him in for testing.
<user0> Oh no I'm very sorry. What kind of pet? 
<user1> A border collie, he was a great doggie.
<user1> Oh no, have you been able to calm yourself down?
<user0> She called several hours later to let me know everything was ok. I worry even more because they live so far away.
<user1> I can understand that, I think I would be a mess too.
<user1> That does not sound plpeasant at all, maybe they should relocate those who are staying there.
<user0> I relocated myself to a hotel to stay there until it gets repaired. Luckily my insurance is paying for my stay, but I'll be suing the hell out of the trucking company.
<user1> Hopefully no one was injured at all from the accident?
<user1> I bet you are, that's some pretty good foresight right there! Did you have to use it this past winter?
<user0> I did, two days after packing it we had a blizzard and my tire went flat out in the middle of it. I would have been very unhappy had I not packed it.
<user1> How satisfying must it be to have something like that ready to go in case of emergency, and then to actually get to use it? I'm pretty jealous, and proud in a vicarious kind of way.
<user0> I was, and happy to have water, granola bars, and an extra cell phone charger!
<user0> Well good luck with that!
<user1> Thank you, I have been compiling  data for 5 years, my brain is totally absorbed by it.
<user0> What are you studying?
<user1> Criminal and social justice.
<user1> Do roller coasters scare you
<user0> I think it was just the thought of being so high up.
<user1> I used to be afriad of heights too
<user1> That's a bummer. Maybe next time you can join them.
<user0> Hopefully, but the worst part is there is nothing to do on the weekend with everyone gone.
<user1> Sound like a Netflix weekend then. Hope you got a lot of work done.
<user1> Goodness, you're right about that. Plus a pet is the only thing to show unconditional and neverending love for you.
<user0> Exactly, and they never demand anything from you. When my golden retriever Louie died a few weeks ago, I honestly thought I would die too.
<user1> I'm so very sorry for your loss, I can only imagine that pain. I had to put my girl down 3 years ago and I promise that it does get easier.
<user0> Thank you, that's good to hear. I find it pretty difficult to continue on most days...but I suppose it's starting to get easier.
<user0> It's the worst waiting for vacations! You want the time before to go fast but then it to go slow during. Never works out that way, unfortunately.
<user1> Yes! Completely the opposite of what you want. The universe can be funny like that. But I had an absolute blast!
<user0> That's great! I'm glad you had a good time. I've never been on a cruise before but it sounds like I need to try one out!
<user0> And how is she doing now
<user1> She is a normal A-B student and just started 8th grade
<user0> That is awesome.  Sometimes a second opinion is all you need
<user0> aww that's too bad.  I hope you got some solid netflix in at least!
<user1> I was hoping to get a chance to play outside and get some sun.
<user0> bummer.  Well I hope you get a chance to do that soon!
<user0> Oh that sounds fun!
<user1> Not really I  almost had an accident at some of the startling points.
<user0> That isn't good at all, glad you didn't have an accident. 
<user0> Did you find any good companies.
<user1> a couple but it amazes me how expensive insurance is
<user0> Did you have alot of accidents that can jack your rates up.
<user0> It's okay! Try to rest on the couch and that might help!
<user1> Thank you, being on a diet is hard with sweets in the house. 
<user0> I know that feeling all too well. But don't get down on it, just try better tomorrow.
<user0> That must have been scary.  Is that the first time it has happened to you?
<user1> Sadly no, I get them maybe once a year. The worst part was that I had nothing to be stressed about. 
<user0> Are you able to do anything to prevent them?
<user0> I'm sure that he will turn up soon. I really hope that you find him.
<user1> We have been driving around all evening looking for him. He really is my best friend.
<user0> Maybe check your local animal shelters? Sometimes they are taken there by people who find them. 
<user1> We will have to go there next, hopefully he is chilling there. 
<user1> Aww, I'm sorry to hear that.  Was it a bad break up or did you part on good terms?
<user0> That's just it. We didn't really "break up" in the traditional sense. She just sort of stopped talking to me and I eventually texted her and said okay, thanks for the memories. But it was rough.
<user1> That's really odd.  I wonder why they didn't have the courtesy to let you know that they'd lost interest or whatever the case may be.  To just cut off contact seems a little rude.
<user1> How thoughtful.  Now you have to pay it forward, as the saying goes.
<user0> I will, you never know when someone else is in need! 
<user1> Kindness is infectious.
<user0> It is, I have been so blessed in my life! 
<user0> How exciting, is he a non-traditional student?
<user1> Yes, he is still active duty army but getting out in November. I am so proud of him furthering his education!
<user0> That is really good, speaking from experience, all military men and women should get a degree.
<user0> Why? What happened? I hope you didn't get food posioning.
<user1> No poisoning, but my burger had a long hair in it, so I couldn't eat it.
<user0> Oh gosh, that is gross! Maybe tell the manager so he can make it right, and make sure his staff is doing things to health codes!
<user1> So gross, that is certain.
<user1> Oh no! I hope you did not burn yourself.
<user0> I thankfully didn't burn myself bad but I spilled it all over myself! I was so shy afterwards 
<user1> Hopefully you were wearing dark clothing, coffee on light colors stinks!
<user1> Oh no! What happened?
<user0> I went for a drink downstairs, and the back door was wide open. I didn't sleep a wink and kept my phone and a big knife with me the rest of the night,lol.
<user1> Oh man! I would have been so scared! 
<user0> I really was, and I'm supposed to be the grown up, but I got my daughter to lie next to me.
<user0> Ugh that's so annoying. What are they even barking at?
<user1> People walking on the bike trail behind our house. It's a daily thing, it gets so annoying! 
<user0> Yeah, that would drive me crazy. Sounds like the neighbor needs to control their dogs.
<user0> I do that all the time, no big deal.
<user1> I feel so full and fat and happy. I can't wait to do it again.
<user0> What kind of pizza did you eat?
<user0> That is such a relief, it is so nice to have money saved up in the bank. 
<user1> Yes exactly! I was able to finally start saving for retirement. I'd been procrastinating somewhat, so it really was a relief, like you said.
<user0> Oh yeah, retirement will come before you know it, it is good to be prepared! 
<user0> Oh wow, now that really is exciting, congratulations! Did you get the grade level and subject you wanted?
<user1> I am teaching at a small private school, so I will be teaching all the subjects for 3rd grade. I am pretty excited, just nervous. 
<user0> Teaching little humans will be such a joy. I really hope you enjoy it!
<user1> It really is, you are molding their future! 
<user1> That sucks, will she not let you see the dog at all?
<user0> No we are not on speaking terms, It's pretty unfair, thankfully we didn't have a kid together.
<user1> Yes, that is probably a positive.
<user1> Yeah it really does. It's even worse to try and close those accounts!
<user0> They don't want to. I lost mine or it was stolen. But all my autopay bills are at a standstill and the companies are not happy about it.
<user1> Man that sounds really stressful...
<user0> It is, to say the least. But at leaast it will be over at some point.
<user0> oh that is awesome. what does she do?
<user1> She is an accountant for a college in Alaska. She's been working their for years so I'm glad they saw her dedication :)
<user0> that is great. my sister is an account too. she's also the office manager.
<user0> Congrats to your friend! That is an amazing accomplishment.
<user1> Yeah it was! I joke with her that I should get a portion of the money since I told her she had a really good piece and that she should submit it. She wasn't originally going to.
<user0> I would be proud of her too! Hopefully her success continues. You sound like a good friend!
<user0> don't be. i'm sure you raised him right. he will be starting his new adventure
<user1> I think it's more stressful for me than it is for him!  I just want the best for him, just not used to not being there with him.
<user0> i'm sure he's cool as a cucumber while you are a nervous wreck. it will be fine.
<user1> Thanks!  I m sure it will be to just have to get over it and let him grow up.  Gotta lose the control freak in me at some point right?
<user0> it will be find. have a little fiath in him and you will see
<user1> Cant wait to see what he can do,  Its exciting too!  
<user0> it's very exciting. i wish you both all the best.
<user0> I remember that console, that's old school.
<user1> It sure is now, but back then it was the cream of the crop. You can bet that I stayed up a few hours past my bedtime to play it that evening.
<user0> Those were the good old days!
<user0> are you able to get some tutoring or find a study buddy?
<user1> I found a study group, I didn't flunk the class. But I made an 84 on my physics test and need an 86.
<user0> thats good.. well you are on your way up!
<user1> Hopefully, I don't even understand how others get all A's.
<user1> Thats awesome, can we trade?
<user0> Haha my husband plays video games as well, but we limited it to after my daughter goes to bed only.
<user1> That is a really good idea. He must be thoughtful to have cooked dinner for you and had it ready, unlike mine
<user1> that is very true
<user0> Not only did I have a rough morning because of it, but I had to deal with the caffeine withdrawal headache all day at work. What a disaster.
<user1> hopefully its better tomorrow!
<user1> Hmm, that's interesting tell me more about what that number means to you.
<user0> Four years old is the age a child needs to be for a bearded dragon, they carry something in their nails/claws.
<user1> Really, my friend had a tarantula as a pet when she was five, scared the poop out of me
<user0> My son wanted one of those once, but when we got to the pet store he refused to hold one,lol.
<user0> Are you really able to work from home? Finding a gig is so difficult, I'm glad that it is working for you.
<user1> Yeah it's still a work in progress but I'm young and basically living on peanuts, good thing I'm not allergic
<user0> 5
<user0> That is fantastic. Any good new lately?
<user1> Nope! I just realized how happy and content I am with my life! 
<user0> That is an amazing feeling. 
<user0> did you go to the doctor
<user1> No, thankfully my symptoms weren't anything that couldn't be managed with a stiff mimosa or seven. But still, I had to throw those cups out. Yuck.
<user0> yuk for sure
<user0> Well, did you eat her ice cream?
<user1> I certainly would have liked to, but I'm lactose intolerant! If I had eaten it, I would have been so miserable that there's no way she would've mistaken it.
<user0> I wonder who actually ate it then.
<user1> She probably did, during one of those nights when she stumbles into the apartment at 3am, drunk, with some random guy she brought home from the club.
<user0> So are you saying it could be the guy?
<user1> Either he ate it, or she did and she just doesn't remember doing it. All I know is that I didn't do it, and I'm about to hulk out!
<user1> You will be fine. Its going to be hard but dont beat yourself up over it.
<user0> I hope you're right. I've read lots of parenting books, and I've been seeing my therapist regularly. There's just so much that I'm still worried about.
<user1> Then it sounds like you are already ahead of most new fathers. 
<user1> That would be pretty cool to see, but you should know that typically most cats swish their tail when they're annoyed or angry! It didn't attack you, did it?
<user0> I attacked it with some pets, it was an outside cat which don't get angry too much I'm guessing
<user1> Ahh, okay. Yeah I don't know. It might have also been scared or feeling like it had to protect it's turf. But still, that's neat to see and not an everyday thing!
<user1> Nice, I guess the only times I was nervous to take a test was when I wasn't prepared, but there's only so much preparation you can do until you just have to trust your brain or whatever
<user0> That's true. I probably have it down pat at this point. It's just it's my first graduate course, and I want to ace my entire graduate degree with a 4.0 GPA. This is my first major major grade.
<user1> Wow! You must have like every technique in your toolbox to go for that goal
<user1> i bet it does bud, I know the feeling. So how do you deal with it
<user0> Well, I spent some time remembering the good times. Then I reminded myself that we broke up for a reason, and we'd moved on. Had to process all the way through it, you know?
<user1> yes i know, good memories do help. every relation is a new chapter in the book called our life.
<user1> sometimes they cant avoid it 
<user0> I threw the car in reverse and hauled my butt backwards!
<user1> ok
<user1> I cant imagine how scared you must have been.
<user0> Uh oh, did he destroy something? Sounds as though he misbehaved a bit.
<user1> Not sure. You must be very confused. Did you crash?
<user0> 2
<user0> Oh god. Was it big?
<user1> Yes, im scared to sleep! It ran under couch last time I saw it.
<user0> Well, maybe look at its lifespan? Maybe it'll die if you end up not finding it.
<user0> what does she draw
<user1> Mostly anime characters and various portraits. She's still quite young, so she has a way to go, but if you asked me to draw anything similar to what she can when I was her age? Forget about it.
<user0> thats awesome
<user0> Kayla sounds wonderful! How long have you guys been friends?
<user1> I'll have known her for 7 years next year. She really is wonderful. I've gone through a lot of tough stuff in my life, and she's always been supportive.
<user0> Finding someone like that is rare. Take good care of that one!
<user0> I am sorry to hear that. How far along is it?
<user1> It's stage two. I think I'll be able to beat it because I'm otherwise in great health, and it hasn't metastasized or anything. I just wasn't expecting to have to deal with this incredibly difficult time ahead of me.
<user0> Keep a positive attitude. I will be thinking of you!
<user1> Thank you so much for being supportive. :)
<user1> Did you find out what happened?
<user0> Not a chance! I was too scared to go out, and I didn't want to peek my head out to talk to the police or anything when they showed up. I honestly thought someone might have barged into my house and started trying to shoot me.
<user1> Man. That must've been really nerve wrecking. Did you get any sleep?
<user0> Only the couple of hours before the gunshots woke me up. After that, no way jose.
<user0> did it turn out ok ?
<user1> Seems to have, yeah. He has a lot less neck pain now than he has this past year, but that's happened during his previous neck surgeries as well.
<user0> hopes he continues to get better
<user1> Yes, hopefully he does, because this was one of the last neck surgeries they were willing to do before fusing his neck completely, not allowing him to be able to turn his head anymore.
<user1> I'm so sorry!  Don't lose hope though. I know some science based nutrition that helps you overcome and kill it going high nutrition plant based vegan.  Look up Dr. Joel Furhman.  It'll save you from all the meds that hurt your body.
<user0> I might look into that, thank you for being supportive. I know it's nowhere near a death sentence anymore, it's just there are so many questions. Can I have kids, is a big one.
<user1> I know it must be overwhelming you but coming from someone that is fighting chronic epstein barr virus and Lupus, it will change your life.  Check out HIV and going vegan on youtube and thebody,com and so many other resources.  You might be able to reverse it and it wouldn't even be a concern for having kids.  You take care and have hope!
<user1> Sounds like you're feeling nostalgic.  What games were you plaing?
<user0> Super smash bros is a classic, never gets old, but yeah you're right
<user1> I've never played it but its supposed to havea bunch of old game characters in it
<user1> Oh, how did it go?
<user0> Not well. I didn't really feel prepared for it.
<user1> I'm sorry, I am sure you will be ready next time.
<user1> Wait, why would you be annoyed by that? That's amazing!
<user0> Yeah, yeah, yeah. Amazing and all, but it was supposed to be MY discovery. I wanted that Nobel Prize and the trip to Stockholm. Now I don't think my dad will ever think I've accomplished anything.
<user1> I think you need to look at the bigger picture, though. Someone cured a disease that has caused so much suffering for so many people. Though I suppose to can be both excited for the discovery and jealous at the same time. The two aren't mutually exclusive.
<user1> What movie did you see
<user0> Jurassic World. It was okay.
<user1> Yeah I have heard bad things to be honest
<user1> Wow. Does he usually do stuff like that?
<user0> Yeah, he will eat or drink whatever he finds in the fridge. 
<user1> Damn well, he's gonna have to learn some boundaries with that.
<user1> It is indeed unfair, they shouldn't have done that
<user0> I think people are just getting riled up for the midterms
<user1> you are right. But hey people just do what they want to!!
<user1> I bet that was awkward
<user0> Yeah, nobody said anything
<user1> I guess that happens sometimes, did you finish the game
<user1> That is terrible and a little odd!
<user0> Yeah, tell me about it! I trusted her to only cheat on me with other men, but I just don't know how I can deal with this betrayal!!!
<user1> Wait, you were ok with her cheating?
<user0> Not like this! She assured me that she wasn't that type of girl, and I was stupid enough to believe her.
<user0> Yes indeed! what did you do?
<user1> I helped him pack the essentials in his wood-paneled station wagon and filled his gas tank for him. It was the least I could do.
<user0> You did great! Family comes first. And you gave him your support!
<user0> That's great!!  History is so important I think and so few kids really grasp it well.  Congrats to him for a job well done!
<user1> No no, see, it was the first grade below an A that he's ever made. I honestly thought I had the next Einstein on my hands. Now I guess I'll have to settle for...above average, I guess. :(
<user0> Oh, I see what you are saying!  Did he get upset about it?  And you never know, he could turn it around next year and blow you away!
<user1> He seemed fine about it, which is weird because he's always been so proud to bring home straight As. I'm really hoping he does turn it around next year. I also hope he's not on drugs or something. I suppose we'll see.
<user1> Wow, is that true? That's pretty amazing! I'd say science should know about your dog.
<user0> I'd say you're certainly right about that! He's got the best Cockney accent though, and won't shut up about philosophy. It's all he wants to talk about! Like okay, we get it, you're suuuuper into Immanuel Kant, cool.
<user1> Wow, that surely is incredible! Even the accent too? And intelligent! The full package!
<user1> Dang, that's a lot of dogs. Cleaned out the pound, you did. But that doesn't hold a candle to the 100 I ate yesterday.
<user0> Ah, I see you are a man of culture as well. I would relish the opportunity to eat alongside you one day at the troughs of battle. Be warned, however: only those with the strongest of stomachs have ever dared to challenge me!
<user1> How dare you question my intestinal fortitude?!? I would watch out, friend. I may just slip some cyanide in your relish if I ever have the chance to challenge you!
<user0> Hmph. Well, you should check the by-laws. Major League Eating Official Rulebook page 42, section 4.2.b strictly forbids the usage of cyanide as a food enhancement. You must eat the food as is. So I'm afraid I'll have to report you to the governing board and get you disqualified.
<user0> That is so nice of him. Are you feeling better?
<user1> Yes, I feel much better now.
<user0> That's good to hear. I hope I meet someone that will do that for me.
<user0> That would bring the tears. I love looking at pictures especially old ones.
<user1> Yes, it definitely did. It reminded me of a simpler time, before she abandoned our family to join the local nudist colony. Oh, I do miss her though. She was just the best!
<user0> Sounds like you are conflicted. She ran off but she's the best? Are you being sarcastic?
<user1> I'm just saying I respect her life choices, but she was a great mom while she was around. I think she's brave.
<user1> That's a tragedy! What ever did you do?!?!
<user0> I told her she was a bad dog and had to clean it up.
<user1> Serves her right! These animals can't go around thinking they can poop on our things!
<user1> Holy moses, he must be as smart as me. I solved that thing in five minutes last week. Child's play.
<user0> Child's play is right, the kid is only 6 years old. And you couldn't have, because the Clay Institute says the million dollar prize is still at large, which I'm sure he will be blowing immediately on Tropical Sprite and cocaine.
<user1> Yeah, that's what they tell everyone because, in reality, they blew all the prize money on the very same thing themselves. I was pretty peeved that I couldn't even get a dime bag and the sleeziest of hookers.
<user1> Ahh, that's too bad, did you mention it to your boss?
<user0> My boss is pretty temperamental and doesn't like people questioning his decisions, probably a bad idea. 
<user1> Oh I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe next time!
<user1> I bet. That is so sad. I am so sorry.
<user0> Yeah hes really lost without her. It was unexpected. 
<user1> I bet! I hope they can find peace soon.
<user1> Time will make it better. You just have to move on.
<user0> Yeah, I know but we were planning to start our lives together. We were moving in and now I have to rethink everything.
<user1> Better to find out now then move in and invest your time. Trust me it's worse.
<user1> Really? What kind was it?
<user0> It was apple pit,  I let it cool to room temp and ate it with ice cream it was so good.
<user1> Oh I love apple pie with ice cream, it's such a good combination
<user1> Nice, I wish I could get a pair of those shoes.
<user0> I feel on top of the world. I don't know whoever said things can't bring you happiness. They must never owned a pair of Yeezy's
<user1> How much did you pay for them?
<user1> I love a warm fire outside while camping! Sounds like a great time.
<user0> Yeah, I ended up falling asleep to the dying fire. I felt very safe and secure.
<user1> Yes that sounds like a wonderful way to sleep.
<user1> That sounds like it could be quite a scary experience.
<user0> I started a small fire in the trash can to get some light. It almost started a fire.
<user1> Oh yeah that's a bit dangerous. Candles are good to have on hang.
<user1> Why are you worried?
<user0> These muslim countries can be a bit fanatic 
<user1> That is true but Dubai is a bit better
<user1> Oh no! Was it still there when you went back?
<user0> Of course, I'm not worried no one would steal from me.
<user1> You never know these days. Luckily there are cameras everywhere.
<user1> why? are you having financial problems?
<user0> Yes I just had a major car repair and it took a massive chunk of my savings. $700
<user1> oh god , that sounds horrible but at least nothing bas happened to you!
<user1> Oh no, what did you do to stay cheerful ?
<user0> lol I played xbox games
<user1> Sounds good, when she got back I hope you schooled her on Halo ?
<user1> what kind of health problems ?
<user0> Blood pressure and crohns disease, as well as, a few minor ones. Not sure why but today I feel really good! Slept well, woke up happy and energized
<user1> i'm glad you feel good today!
<user1> lol! I remember those drills when I was a kid!
<user0> Ahh, then you know exactly what I mean. I don't see a single thing wrong with my plan. I'm not sure why everyone is so worried about North Korea or Iran or Russia or something when it's just like...get a school desk. It's not hard, people.
<user1> And your largest hardback book will protect you from a tornado as long as you put it over your head and sit in the hall!!
<user0> Actually a genius, I love it. Parents and teachers tried to tell us that going to school would prepare us for the world. We just didn't know how right they were, did we?
<user0> That's normal. Try to just be your self. I'm sure it will work out fine.
<user1> I'm hoping for the best, but not getting my hopes up too high. I need a new job!!
<user0> Amen, me too.   I hate my current job.
<user0> It's not crazy! I'm all about cleaning up. I LOVE the smell of clean house
<user1> Me too. I live in a first floor apartment and it gets so dusty. Now I'll be able to clean the carpet and the couch! Funny how some strange things lift your spirits.
<user0> I find it very satisfactory to clean and vacuum :) I bet it will smell so good
<user1> Hope so. I'm moving out of this apartment and into another one in a few weeks, so I want it to be really clean.
<user1> That's good. I know that would be difficult.
<user0> She really has become such a good mom. I must have done something right ha ha
<user1> That is great. I am sure you are proud and you should be!
<user1> That's always both an exciting time and a nerve-wracking time. I'm in college and I had to move the past two years in a row. This year, I decided I kinda had enough and would just stay put, even though the apartment was just so-so. Do you like it well enough even if the neighbors may give you trouble?
<user0> Not really, but my current upstairs neighbors are awful and I feel it'd be worth moving just to get away from them!
<user1> Oh yeah, I know the type. Where they sound like they're having a parade at 3AM. Sorry you had to go through that. Luckily (or unluckily, if you want to see it that way) I have a loud window AC unit in my apartment, so even if they did make noise, I couldn't hear them over it!
<user0> Lucky you! And you're bang on about the 3am parade - sounds like a herd of elephants. Maybe I should speak with the current tenant of my new place before moving - just to see how the neighbors are.
<user0> Oh wow that is a huge commitment! How did it go?
<user1> It has been amazing! We have enjoyed every minute of the last 2 years. My kids are seeing and experiencing things that they may have never been able to see or do. 
<user0> That is really awesome! Im glad it all worked out for you!
<user1> Thank you! We have had so much fun an dI now realize that I had nothing to be so worried about lol.
<user1> Yes I feel like that every time I look at old pictures!
<user0> It's good to know others feel the same.  I mean, I love my life right now, but sometimes it would be nice to go to something simpler for a bit.
<user1> I agree and time jut goes by too fast!
<user1> Do you reach out to your friends from your childhood?
<user0> As much as I can, but some have gotten far enough away that I'm not sure how to track them down anymore.
<user1> Exhaust all options, social media is a big way to stay connected
<user1> Wow!  What was in the package?
<user0> It was a carpet/upholstery cleaner and is quite heavy. I'm disabled, so wouldn't have been able to carry it. They don't normally do deliveries, so I thought that was really nice of him to do that.
<user1> That was really nice!  What a wonderful surprise!  This act of kindness helps to restore my faith in humanity.
<user0> The service they provide is so considerate and thoughtful. I'd probably move out of the complex if it wasn't for the staff!
<user0> Nice do you still keep in touch with her
<user1> yes but she lives in a different country, different time zone so we barely have time to talk. I wish she lived closer
<user0> Well if you stay in touch then I'm sure she'll come back...but in the meantime try to take your mind off her or get involved in something fun so you have cool stories to tell her
<user0> What book do you enjoy reading?
<user1> Lots of things. I like historical novels and legal dramas best. What about you? Does reading give you a sense of relaxation?
<user0> No, actually I'm under a lot of stress right now and I'm in pretty dire straights financially. The only book i'm really reading at this time is the Bible.
<user1> There's no finer book to help you in distressful times than the Bible. I hope it gives you a sense of peace to read it. So sorry to hear you're stressed out.
<user1> Where is your home village?
<user0> In the North of Scotland. It used to be a quiet little place, and now there are hideous buildings in really prominent places!
<user1> That's a shame. I"m sorry to hear that.
<user0> Me to. I was even considering moving back there some day, but not after seeing the mess the planners have made of it.
<user1> Do you live in the United States now?
<user0> Yes. I've been here for about 20 years now and love it. But there's something about where I grew up which pulls (or rather pulled) me back.
<user1> Yes it sounds like it was a great place to grow up.
<user1> I love dogs! What breed is he?
<user0> he is a french puddle and i love him very much
<user1> That's so sweet! We have blue healers, they just make the world better.
<user1> Oh my goodness, that must have been terrifying until you figured out what was going on.
<user0> Nah - I knew that they were just having fun with me!  I was blindfolded and put in the trunk of a big car (I am tiny).
<user1> Well at least you had a good time.  Did they do something nice for you after?
<user0> Well they took me to a local fountain and dunked me in it!  It was warm out so it was funny and I liked that they cared about me.
<user0> Do you ever offer to help thm?
<user1> yes i go to my local charity every weekend
<user0> GOod for you, I feel bad for never helping out.
<user0> Awesome.  What are you going to do with the money.
<user1> I'm really not sure. I was shocked to win that much. 
<user0> Don't spend it all in one place :)
<user1> I'll try not to. I'll probably just save it :)
<user0> Putting it away for a rainy day is the best bet.,
<user0> Haha, that's a nice way to enjoy a sad moment, how are you feeling recently?
<user1> Much better, thanks :)  Yeah, I was really just doing anything to feel a connection.
<user0> I'm happy to hear you're doing better. If you feel that way again please reach out.
<user0> Oh my, you must have been annoyed with your cat. I guess he just wanted your attention.
<user1> I was SO mad! I felt so bad being mad at him 
<user0> Aw he's just a kitty after all. I'm sure he didn't mean to make you mad.
<user0> What prize was it, or what was the competition, rather? I'm interested to know, but don't want to pry, if you don't feel like saying.
<user1> It was a $25 Visa gift card. The competition was a talent show. I didn't win unfortunately but It's ok
<user0> Ah, gotcha. It's good to see that you tried and that you care that much. Most people are too lazy or scared to compete in things, myself included. I hope you continue to do the things that make you competitive and interested.
<user0> Was it any good?
<user1> It was! I was super nervous about it though cause of how cheap it was 
<user0> Sometimes the cheap things are the best
<user0> I bet it is! When my grandma was alive it was so heartbreaking to see her in pain. She broke her hip right before her death and she just couldn't recover
<user1> yeah it is the worst having someone in the hospital
<user0> i hope she will recover soon. Stay strong and think positive
<user0> where is that ?
<user1> Kazakhstan. I miss it and i miss my parents and friends so much
<user0> isnt that where bruno is from ?
<user1> not bruno but borat lol such a stupid movie. I honestly can't stand that actor and his toilet humor
<user1> That's great that they accomplished that and even better that you recognize their achievements.
<user0> Yeah, they are truly an inspiration that anyone can go to college no matter the age
<user1> OK I didn't realize that they may have gone after you were born as opposed to before.
<user1> I am prepared to go camping tonight in the woods
<user0> aren't you afraid of the wild animals that will be roaming the area?
<user0> That sounds peculiar. I've never known a dog with such finesse, yours may have talent.
<user1> He's an evil genius.  He tried to get toys out of a christmas stocking one time by climbing on the coffee table.
<user0> That's really cool, it makes me want to consider getting a dog.
<user0> what did she do ?
<user1> We went camping and she prepared everything rather quickly including the tents
<user0> wow that was nice of her
<user0> What kind of gaming is it?
<user1> Shooting game
<user0> That's sounds interesting!
<user0> I'd imagine so.  How long have you been a sky diving instructor for?
<user1> I have been instructing for 12 years but skydiving for 25
<user0> Aweseme.  I want to go skydiving sometime.
<user1> You shoudl definitely try it!
<user1> wow thats a good job
<user0> Considering I've been using a walker for the past two years, yes it is. Thanks!
<user1> keep it up!
<user0> Every day I practice - I'll be back on the golf course in no time, lol.
<user0> That sounds frustrating. How did it affect you?
<user1> It is hard because cars come up the road all the time and turn around in my drive.
<user0> Ooh, that would be aggravating. I guess there isn't much you can do.
<user1> I just have to wait for the city to fix the collapsed road and reopen the road again.
<user1> Best of luck! What are you bidding for
<user0> I am bidding on a rare comic book
<user1> Archie? marvel? dc?
<user1> Sometimes dogs just bark a lot. Did anything happen?
<user0> Thankfully not really, it stopped near me and barked a lot until someone got it, but it was really frightening until it was retrieved.
<user1> Thank goodness. I'd be scared, too. You can't really know whether a dog is harmless or not sometimes.
<user1> It has, what did you see that impressed you?
<user0> well the phones are basically a 1990's computer
<user1> They're more powerful than that. More like an early 2000's computer.
<user1> What did i tell you about doing that. It was a chocolate cake right?
<user0> It was! I just couldn't stop! It was so good that I just had to keep eating 
<user1> Ok, at least it was the right kind of cake you liked. But still not a good thing.
<user1> That is really great.  You don't find too many people willing to help others financially.  Do you have a really good job?
<user0> Ehh, its not the best but it's not bad either\
<user1> It's good just to have enough these days.
<user1> Which film was it?
<user0> It was the First Purge
<user1> I haven't heard of it, sounds interesting though.
<user1> That's good. I live in a small town but we have a big shopping center across the street and there are all the stores i love 
<user0> Nice! You just don't expect it in a rural area. Well, I didn't anyway. We have large grocery stores and a little (but very good) organic grocery store. Quite incredible.
<user1> wow even organic store? that's pretty cool
<user0> I find it hard to believe, myself! This is the rural south, yet there are fine dining restaurants, the aforementioned store, really good independent stores selling all sorts of stuff.
<user0> Really? It doesn't bother me at all. I wonder why you feel that way?
<user1> because the food is all soggy and mushy. i don't know, such a yucky feeling
<user0> Well, most people have intense likes and dislikes. Personally, I can't stand cigar smoke, but some people love it! I guess in your case, you need to scrape the food off the plate first.
<user0> I can imagine they are a right pain to pick up after!
<user1> yeah they even have a bin specially for that
<user0> What an annoyance!
<user0> Oh me too. I'm not a driver but that is so annoying.
<user1> yeah it really makes me mad to see that people dont care about these types of things
<user0> It can be really dangerous too
<user0> That is terrible.  Was it dead or just injured?
<user1> Thank goodness it was dead, poor thing is not suffering, but some people can be so cruel.
<user0> That is true.  I would hate for people to be shooting things that close to my house, too.  Do you know who it was?
<user0> What's been holding you back?
<user1> It's a little pricey and I'm worried I won't like the food and waste all that money. It has good reviews though
<user0> That's a tough decision to make. It's good to try new things sometimes and I'm sure the waiters can recommend you a nice meal you'll enjoy based off your preferences.
<user0> That is very cool!  I love when food is authentic.  Do you shop there often?
<user1> About once a week. Her husband works in the store, so he brings her food in regularly. It's such a pleasure to find such a thing - I missed my Indian food!
<user0> I have never tried making Indian food myself, but I do really enjoy Indian restaurants.  I am jealous.  
<user1> Well, my uncle's Indian and his sisters and mother taught my aunt to cook, and she taught me. But I'm disabled right now so can't cook much. This is such a find!
<user1> That's awesome!  Have you gotten any better yet?
<user0> I hope so I have a big horse tournament against my buddies I want to win the 100 bucks prize.
<user1> That would be cool.  Hopefully the hard work will pay off
<user1> Urgh that sounds like the worst! How early?
<user0> Not until about 8am, but it's so loud I can hear it in my first floor apartment with the doors and windows closed. Idiot man!
<user1> So inconsiderate! It reminds me of my neighbours doing building work one morning at 6AM!
<user0> Yikes! Why are some people such inconsiderate creeps? It makes me really mad!
<user1> Me too! 
<user0> I've called management twice about it and both times he quietened down - for about two days. Then up it goes again!
<user1> How many times do you need to tell them!? :(
<user1> I tend to believe that those who have Biblical faith do have a certainty, that God will bless them despite circumstances. 
<user0> I have just bought a ticket to a britney spears live show in vegas.
<user1> Oh really, when are you going to go see her?
<user0> The show is in three months, I hope she sings he late 90s hits.
<user1> I hope you have a good time at the concert, and she sings all the songs you're looking forward to.
<user1> Congratulations! That must have been such a great feeling.
<user0> It really was - I can't wait to move in! It's a smaller apartment, but quieter (I hope!).
<user1> I can't wait for the day I move out into my own place!
<user0> You'll get there. It really is nice to have your own space. Do you live at home?
<user1> I do, I live with my parents because I'm in university and I'm still pretty young. Hopefully by next year!
<user0> Good for you! Start saving your money now - believe me, you'll need it!
<user0> Those are my nightmares. They are so big where I live in the South.
<user1> It was almost as bug as a golf ball I felt like throwing up.
<user0> I would immediately start spraying bug spray all over. Those things terrify me. 
<user0> I don't know how you do it. I can't stand long drives.
<user1> I put music on and open the window. Otherwise I'll disappear into my own little world, and that's not a good thing to do when you're driving!
<user0> Definitely not! Music is a great idea though; I listen to music on all bus rides and car rides.
<user1> It really helps to pass the time, not to mention it can calm you down. And the drive's quite easy and very pretty, which help.
<user1> Thats awesome.  What kind of computer are you getting?
<user0> It was just a new model HP that I bought but I'm so excited! 
<user1> very nice.  Id be super excited too.  Have some fun playing with it
<user1> Yeah it is really nice to have other people do your shopping
<user0> It helps me a lot as I'm disabled and it can be quite difficult. Anyway, I hate grocery shopping!
<user1> Shopping is no fun, waiting in lines is not fun.
<user0> Ugh. And don't even get me started on "mini-shoppers" racing round the aisles screeching! Much better to have someone else buy for me!
<user0> I haven't heard of that movie. What's depressing about it?
<user1> It's a romantic love story. Doesn't end so well for the main character.
<user0> Oh dear. I think I'll give it a miss - I cry at the drop of a hat! You should watch a comedy next, just to cheer yourself up!
<user0> ohhh cute!! i am so happy for you, smart boy!
<user1> yeah i was so proud of him as well i thought i would have to wait months till he got to that point
<user0> a rare one, i hope he goes a long way and maybe even be the next Einstein we need
<user0> What did you do there?
<user1> I was going to hang out, but I ended up tripping and smashing my toe up into a rock.
<user0> Sounds painful, did you have to go to the doctor?
<user0> oh god, that must have been the worst way to wake up in the morning
<user1> yeah i was furious we are in some sort of a prank war
<user0> oh, do you have any revenge planned?
<user0> That is really scary!  What was it?
<user1> Turned out to be a skunk! It sounded so strange! 
<user0> Yuck!  Stay away from that guy!
<user0> Sounds like quite an adventure for one semester! What was your favorite place?
<user1> I love all over Italy, but I also loved Germany and France and Spain.
<user0> Nice! Must have made you really happy to see so many different places.
<user1> Yes it was truly an amazing time meeting people from so many different cultures
<user1> Lol! I thought you were going to say MESSY! Good kids!
<user0> Wonders never cease to amaze me. First time for everything I guess, lol
<user1> So true! Maybe they want something or they did something bad and are hiding it lol
<user0> I totally thought the same thing. Too funny (but you might be right)
<user1> Lol ;) Well enjoy the clean house, don't worry about the rest!
<user1> oh awesome, i love ziplining, last time i went was 3 years ago tho, how did you find it?
<user0> I found it using the Internet.  It was a lot of hiking but they had a lot of long lines.
<user1> did you enjoy yourself 
<user0> Yes I did - I had a great time and met some fun people.
<user0> Ouch sucks to be you! jk Did you ice it down
<user1> I iced it up but I was so mad because it was my fault for slamming the door 
<user0> Yes hope you feel better
<user0> Oh no. I have been there before. It was really sad.
<user1> Yes, she's getting older and she's just getting to that point she can't move around good.
<user0> It is sometimes for the best but that doesnt always make it easy. 
<user0> How did you do that? Naturally or with chemo?
<user1> i did it with chemo and it took a lot of time and effort
<user0> I bet! Look in too Chlorella and similar to get rid of any toxins from the chemo :)
<user0> oh yeah? where you planning to move to?
<user1> California. I'm ready for my kids to try out some new schools and be happier :)
<user0> oh that's a very good reason to go, i am happy for you 
<user0> this is what you need to do, get out of your car and go give them a beat down that they need
<user1> i know right i feel like doing that every time but i dont want to get arrested hahaha let karma get them,
<user0> yea but it will feel better if you take action
<user0> oh does that sadden you?
<user1> Sometimes it makes me sad, but than I think how happy my animal friends makes me feel. 
<user0> animals are far better than humans, most humans have long lot their way and follow only their desires, i am also like you and i embrace it and smile :) 
<user0> What are magic cards?
<user1> Collectible cards. My friend bought only a few packs and got incredible cards.
<user0> Oh interesting! Kind of like pokemon cards>?
<user0> oh that's sad, i am sorry for this, where are you going and what  will you do about your dog?
<user1> We are going to a place at the beach that doesn't allow pets with some friends. Our vet also has a kennel there to board dogs so I guess that's what we'll do. She'll be so sad though.
<user0> hmmm I got an idea, how about when you come back you give her an amazing time? 
<user0> Well I hope that you find something. Any particular reason that you are job hunting?
<user1> Current job doesn't pay enough, I'm waiting for the stars to align and something better to come along.
<user0> Keep it up and I'm sure something will turn up!
<user0> how lucky you feeling?
<user1> I know its not likely but I really want to win the new mustang
<user0> well if it's worth anything i give you my luck! i hope you win that mustang!
<user0> That sounds dangerous! You should try to move
<user1> I have been thinking about moving but I have lived here for over 30 years. The area has changed so much.
<user0> You really should! With things like that happening you could get seriously injured
<user1> My fear is that I wont find a safer place. Not much money to find a good neighborhood to move into.
<user1> Cool! That sounds like a great time!
<user0> I was overwhelmed by the enormity of the universe.
<user1> Wow that's pretty deep!
<user1> Wow, that had to be quite a surprise.  I hope you like them
<user0> Yea, i do. hah. They live a few states away, which is why it was so unexpected. don't see them often.
<user1> Well thats good.  Hopefully it was a good party!
<user1> What brand are they?
<user0> Yeezy's, the worst part is the second pair of shoes were both right footed.
<user1> That is crazy did you go return them maybe?
<user1> and what happened?
<user0> I need it to work perfectly I need to get ready for a marathon and I need it to track my progress.
<user1> how long is a marathon?
<user1> Are you nervous?
<user0> Well I don't really know many of the people I will be in front of, so hopefully I don't stutter or something.
<user1> Good Luck!
<user1> Oh no! I hope no one took it!
<user0> I was in a safe neighborhood so i wasn't worried.
<user1> Did you go back for it and get it?
<user1> Wow ! thats quite an accomplishment. How long did you have to practice to perfect that ?
<user0> no time, I have a great memory, It was on a dare I nailed it perfectly.
<user1> Fantastic ! When you get older, your memory tends to play tricks on you lol
<user1> Oh really? Any interesting ones?
<user0> Seriously now I can't drive anywhere. I can't even leave the house for fear of car crashes.
<user1> That's awful! Sounds like it might have caused you some trauma unfortunately.
<user1> Did you catch the person after?
<user0> No. I didn't notice right away. How could someone do that. Im so so mad!
<user1> That is unreal, what did you have in the bags?
<user1> oh my gosh. what happened to him?
<user0> No idea, but I had never seen something like that in person. It looked painful.
<user1> i bet is was. are you ok?
<user1> Oh my god, that is a LOT of weight!
<user0> Yeah it is, it seemed like he had every plate in the gym on the bar. I've never seen someone lift that much in person before.
<user1> That's really cool, I honestly can't even imagine someone lifting that much!
<user1> I've been to one before with my girlfriend, what an amazing experience eh?
<user0> It was! I was the only one around so all the cats came to spend time with me 
<user1> Aren't you the luckiest? 
<user1> Really? What was it?
<user0> A GIANT SPIDER! It was terrible and I was so startled! 
<user1> Oh gross! I would be startled too!
<user1> You must be mad at the cat for that.
<user0> Well it's pretty inconvenient, that's for sure. Nothing I can really do about it now. Just got to keep the door closed I guess. 
<user1> You got too, my cats dont do that thankfully.
<user1> I am so sorry to hear that. We need memories of our fur babies to help us in our grief. 
<user0> Yeah, she wasn't my favorite cat, but I still miss her. Cancer sucks. 
<user1> People do not realize that Animals can get cancer too.  Its more common than we may think. 
<user1> That sounds nice. It's always good to remember better times. What kind of music?
<user0> Like old kind of emo songs, full of angst and whatnot
<user1> Ha, I used to listen to that stuff back in high school. The My Chemical Romance gets me every time.
<user1> Guess you dog isn't one that's going to take the bullet?
<user0> Oh she was ready to fight whatever it was, but she was on a leash thankfully. No, I'm just really easily started, all that anxiety over an armadillo. Im so ashamed lol.
<user1> lol I've never seen an armadillo but that sounds freaky!
<user1> Did you help it?
<user0> Yes, I had to call my local wildlife rescue center to come get it. I hope its okay, they said they think it has a broken wing.
<user1> I hope it get's better! That sounded harsh
<user1> what do you all have planned
<user0> I am making dinner for the both of us. I have a roast in the oven. It smells so good I can't wait until it is ready. 
<user1> that sounds nice, must be a really good "friend"
<user1> What a fantastic feeling. Where you expecting that?
<user0> No not at all! I'm excited because now I can plan a family vacation for this winter.
<user1> Well then. What a great surprise. It sounds like you deserved it.
<user1> For what kind of project?
<user0> It is top-secret. But every time I try and get serious work done, my co-workers won't leave me alone.
<user1> Did you tell them to leave you alone?
<user1> what about doing something you enjoy? 
<user0> It's just not the same doing something by myself. I don't have anyone to go do stuff with. 
<user1> i know it can be tough but maybe trying something new or outside your comfort zone might give you an enjoyable experience
<user1> What is parvo?
<user0> It's a deadly dog illness, basically a virus that often leads to death. We think she caught it at the shelter.
<user1> That's terrible. Can you confirm it?
<user0> Yes, they have to do a fecal sample and test it. We take her in tomorrow to see.
<user1> I hope she is okay. 
<user0> Thank you!
<user0> How ever so exciting! is this your first cruise?
<user1> No, I went on one in highschool but first one with my husband and daughter. It's has been so fun planning it together!
<user0> I hope you have a great trip and cherish the time with your family!
<user0> well that was mighty nice of them, you wash dishes ?
<user1> I sure did, and the food was delicious. I'll have to surprise him with dinner next time.
<user0> thats cool
<user1> What kind of pizza place is it? 
<user1> this summer's weather has been really intense here and honestly a little scary
<user0> Yes, makes you wonder if its global warming. I have been stocking up on food and supplies. Ready for the worst. 
<user1> i hope it doesn't get too bad near you
<user1> Why did he get called back in?
<user0> Someone stole some gear, so they called everyone back to investiage. We had just sat down to eat dinner to!
<user1> Wow, did he get paid for it?
<user0> He is in the military so technically he can be called in 24/7 and is payed on salary!
<user0> my sister loves mac and cheese. she would probably live off of that if given the chance
<user1> It is so good if you add the right amount of pepper. 
<user0> i like paprika in my mac and cheese
<user0> What kind of necklace did you purchase? It's good to treat yourself some times.
<user1> Not sure I just though it looked cool. Hopefully it gets me noticed.
<user0> You will just make sure you have your nice new shirt on with that cool necklace and you will be all eyes lol.
<user0> It could be a medical problem. Make sure its checked out.
<user1> Thank you, I will. I think she is doing it to mark her territory, it started when we brought a new dog home.
<user0> Ohh I see. That is super annoying. Hopefully she gets over this phase and they get along.
<user0> You must have really proud of yourself. Its good to acknowledge your own achievements from time to time.
<user1> Yes, and it can be difficult at times to move up at places, especially when there are many other long timers there!
<user0> I agree, which is why getting into that position can be so gratifying. Hopefully you maintain that level of hard work that got you there.
<user0> oh that sounds nice
<user1> Yes, my kids love it so they are going to be so happy when we get there.
<user0> sounds like a great time, hopefully its not too hot out there
<user0> That sounds like heaven to me as well
<user1> Yeah my kitty is just purring away, we're having a good time watching youtube.
<user0> I have a cat too close to me, they are the best
<user0> Oh thoughtful ! Did she enjoy playing with it ?
<user1> Yes, it was neat to see her play with it. It'll make some great photos, since I have one of me playing with it at her age.
<user0> Its quite wonderful to share your childhood memories with your children isn't it ?
<user0> Congratulations. Are you going on a hollywood
<user1> On a honeymoon, lol? Not right away. He is totally the man of my dreams. I'm so lucky
<user0> Well I am happy for you
<user0> That is terrible. Why do you think that he will lose his job?
<user1> The company is downsizing and cutting a lot of departments. His hasn't been cut yet but there are rumors!
<user0> I understand. That is very stressful. Did he started looking for another jod? It could be solution.
<user0> Thats sad. I love cats
<user1> I do too, it was so sad. 
<user0> How old was the cat?
<user0> Thats awesome. Did she?
<user1> She did! I know I'm the parent so can be biased, but it's really so impressive how well she draws, paints, shades....
<user0> I bet you are so proud. I would definitely be
<user0> Why?
<user1> I had all the paperwork set and ready, I had a blanket cause it was in the winter.
<user0> What happened after your car crashed?
<user0> Flies are so annoying
<user1> It was terrible! Right as I was about to fall asleep the dang thing would land on my nose!
<user0> I had that problem with a mosquito once. I woke up with a bite on the tip of my nose
<user0> I would have hated to clean that up. I wonder why they do that?
<user1> There was nothing to clean.... she definitely swallowed it. I stuck her outside cause I can't even think about dealing with her licking anything right now. Gives me the hebbie jibbes thinking about it.
<user0> Yea that is so gross but also kind of funny. I cant help but laugh.
<user0> Do you have to give a big speech soon?
<user1> I have the perfect delivery and all the talking points drilled down. I will be impressive
<user0> That's the way to go! Practice and practice until you're confident and then the real thing will be a breeze.
<user0> That is horrible. Does he puke up hairball often?
<user1> She pukes up hairballs every now and then I have some salmon flavored jelly i can feed her, but it happens so infrequently I forget to.
<user0> I understand.
<user0> I bet it was very embarrassing?
<user1> Yeah it sure was, you know how mean teenagers can be. It's like they have no empathy or think about what if it was them.
<user0> It's alright we've all been there many times.
<user0> What kind of pizza is it?
<user1> A normal pepperoni but it was terrible!
<user0> Thats never good, I love pizza
<user0> Oh no! That must be so frustrating being in a foreign country
<user1> It was because my Spanish was a bit lacking, it also didn't help that people kept giving me bad directions. I eventually stumbled on it but for a while I was worried I would never make it there.
<user0> I'm glad you eventually found it and didn't have to sleep somewhere else.
<user0> Ahh, it happens. I used to swim competitively so I would sometimes get stunned too when I hear the gun go off
<user1> Yeah, I forgot to take my sweat pants off, that's when I realized running isn't for me
<user0> Ahaha, I hate running too
<user0> Huh, ok.  Do you like her a lot?
<user1> Not really
<user0> Sounds like you don't have much respect for women.  
<user1> Not really. We were very high. We were drunk. But now I feel bad for my partner
<user1> Sometimes the simplest things are the nicest
<user0> I whole heatedly agree! It was just so freeing and peaceful
<user1> I hope you have many more then!
<user1> What did you do in response?
<user0> I called the police after he robbed me.
<user1> That's awful, did you get injured at all?
<user0> No, thankfully, I'm fine but scared.
<user0> That is a terrible tragedy, my friend. Did the dog get sick?
<user1> No, she is fine. I had to find something else to eat though.
<user0> Well that's good. What did you find?
<user0> Did you ask him to turn it down?  Or did you just go flip the circuit breaker to the house?
<user1> I would have totally flipped the circuit breaker if I knew how, but I just asked him to turn it down
<user0> Did he do it?  Cause if not, I might have needed to give him a high five, on the head, with a chair.
<user0> That is pretty disgusting! Did it look like poo coming out again?
<user1> It probably will. 
<user0> I can imagine. Maybe it'll morph into a Super Saiyan poo or something.
<user0> That's a dang shame. Did it get rained on?
<user1> Yes it did, unfortunately 
<user0> That's too bad. Well, on the bright side, maybe a hobo will find it, read it, enlighten himself, and get a job at McDonalds.
<user0> Wow that must have been a surprise for you
<user1> It was, and he does that type of thing a lot.
<user0> you got a great husband
<user0> I know how you feel, it's terrible. I actually moved to a completely different state due to hi taxes.
<user1> Maybe A move out of my state would be the answer and a blessing to the high taxes. 
<user0> It's worth it to consider. I pay less than half in property tax than I used to.
<user0> Always do the same what? What is perfect?
<user1> My girlfriend, How about you? do you have a partner?
<user0> I have been married for 19 years and we have been together 21.
<user1> Wow. Looks like you are doing a good job.
<user1> I've been through that process before and it was not easy. Good thing you had a good adviser.
<user0> Surprisingly it's been a painless process. I'm very thankful.
<user1> You have been very lucky. You should keep their business card in case you ever decide to buy another house.
<user1> I hate when that happens!
<user0> I really thought  I could count on her, but now I haven't even heard a word from her. Lesson learned I guess.
<user1> That's how it goes. I usually consider the money as a lost cause when lending to friends.
<user1> Did what?
<user0> I stole my mother's card details to pay for a subscription.
<user1> I have too... to pay for food though. She told me that she would have paid if I asked but I am too proud.
<user1> Sounds like found!   Are you scared of roller coasters?  I love them!
<user0> I'm really hesitant to get on. It's been a long time since I've ridden one and I don't think I'm going to like it at all
<user1> I hope you do have fun!
<user1> I know how you feel! Our dog of 8 years past away last week spring. It can be so hard 
<user0> It is a horrible experience and i hope that i never have to go through it again, how did yours die?
<user1> Same here. We don't know. He was perfectly fine the night before. We woke up to find him passed away at the foot of our bed. Do you know how yours passed?
<user1> What kind of thing?  You could always change that in the future.
<user0> Money mostly. I just wish i could have enough of it to be set for life.
<user1> Of course, but that is certainly not the most important thing in life, I hope you realize now.
<user1> That's such a great feeling.
<user0> It really is. All the neighbors were so close, we even spent holidays together. It was like a really huge family all living together.
<user1> That sounds really nice. I don't know my neighbors at all
<user1> I watch everyday. love youtube!
<user0> What type of content do you like watching?
<user1> I like self help, motivation, healthy living, and a little bit of conspiracy.
<user1> Oh I get those midnight cravings all the time!
<user0> The worst part was that there was a cake to be eaten! SO I DID! Lmao
<user1> You want cake? Cake is there? Obviously you have to eat it! Lol
<user1> That sounds like a fun thing to do as a couple.
<user0> It was but I was so sad that I was so scared 
<user1> Why were you so scared?
<user1> Oh really, that sounds nice. I miss childhood.
<user0> I do to. It was much easier then for me 
<user1> Sometimes I feel as though our generation (assuming you're a few years around 30) really got a bad deal as far as the economy, politics, and the overall love in the country is concerned.
<user1> Things work out. It doesn't seem like it but they do.
<user0> I remind myself all the time that it will work out and all will be good again.
<user1> It will. I am sure of it.
<user1> Is the city going to build them new ones at least?
<user0> Nope. They bought them out at city valued tax prices and they have 60 days to find another place to live. 
<user1> Well at least they bought them out and they won't be homeless. Still sucks though.
<user1> Oh no! How badly did you hurt yourself?
<user0> A few scraps to my elbows but nothing major, i was just embarrassed.
<user1> That doesn't sound too bad, it could have been much worse! 
<user1> Yes I do play some video games.
<user0> great, I'm anticipating the release of Fallout:76 how about you?
<user1> I've heard some very good things about it. It doesn't come out until November right?
<user1> Sometimes life isn't very fair. I like to think of it as motivation to get a better job.
<user0> Very true. I suppose i just get a bit jealous sometimes.
<user1> It happens, I think it's part of human nature. Just try and focus on your own well-being and you'll be alright!
<user1> Good for you!.  My year have been ok too so far.
<user0> Thanks, I am feeling a lot more confident in myself. Remember the year can only get better.
<user1> You seem to be very hopeful!  That is great.
<user1> I'm so glad to hear that! Did anything in particular make it a good day? Mine's been awesome too!
<user0> Well i had a meeting with my boss who gave me a promotion today so i'm over the moon!.
<user1> Sick, congratulations! Time to celebrate right?
<user1> How awful, besides painful, it must have been scary!
<user0> It was, they we're absolutely furious with me for some reason.
<user1> Were you messing with them, maybe? or taking their honey?
<user1> I do, as if it were yesterday. I remember most of my childhood through video games.
<user0> The nostalgic moments when you play them again is brilliant. You should try it.
<user1> I really want to, but unfortunately my GameCube and N64 no longer function. Also a few of my favorite games are scratched to heck.
<user1> I'm glad to hear that! Things are really going great for me too!
<user0> Well that's even better news! i'm feeling hopeful for the both of us.
<user1> Same here. Let's hope these good times stick around real long!
<user1> You barely even know her, what was she thinking?
<user0> I don't know, she said she needed a place to hang out between jobs. Stupid me actually gave it to her.
<user1> I really hope she doesn't do anything bad to you. You seem like a nice dude.
<user0> hah, thanks. So far so good.
<user0> So what happened? Did you end up ordering some once you both remembered?
<user1> Was annoyed and disappointed so i ended up having a sandwich instead. bad times.
<user0> People make mistakes, it happens. 
<user0> Oh nasty! That must have been a heck of a pain to clean.
<user1> Was absolutely disgusting but luckily it did come out easy.
<user0> I wouldn't have thought it would be so easy, that's good!
<user0> I'm so sorry for your loss, it isn't easy losing a pet. How are you doing?
<user1> It's tough. I was crying so hard that I had to call my husband to come pick us up
<user0> Understandably so. I hope you feel better soon.
<user0> Sounds pretty interesting.  How was it? Did you like it?
<user1> It was nice, after i got over the fear from being 23 stories underground. 
<user0> Wow, That much!   Were you afraid to be trapped like those poor boys in Thailand?
<user1> Hah, no i wasn't thinking of being trapped. It just seemed like more effort to breath for some reason.
<user1> How did that go?
<user0> I think it went alright, i was incredibly anxious about it.
<user1> Those always make me nervous too. I hope it goes well for you!
<user1> Well, I hope they said you could have it.
<user0> Nope, i do feel a bit guilty about it but they should have hid it better.
<user1> You could always replace it for them since you know you shouldn't have taken it.
<user1> Are you scared of heights?
<user0> Yes, I don't like heights at all. I did eventually muster the courage to jump, however.
<user1> I bet that was the ride of your life.
<user1> I think those are very important lessons. Do they always listen?
<user0> They try but it's hard when there are so many bullies at school. I wish other parents would try to do the same.
<user1> I'm a parent and I wish the exact same thing.
<user1> Not entirely, but I do know depending on the game it can take hundreds of people.
<user0> I was really impressed as some games it can take over 10 years.
<user1> As a gamer, I'd love to know more about the games that take that long to make. Which ones?
<user1> Oh man! I hate one night stands!!
<user0> Hah, they can be fun. Though my partner would not have appreciated it! 
<user1> Oh. Yeah. Probably not haha.
<user1> That sounds like fun, how was it?
<user0> It was enjoyable for sure, and poignant too.  It brought up lots of memories of my childhood.
<user1> I bet!  When I got to family reunions there's always so much reminiscing
<user1> Ooh, did you go ahead and go through with it?
<user0> No, I want to keep it because I have faith in the company doing really well longterm.
<user1> Nice, that's a good idea. Good luck!
<user1> Was she nice?
<user0> Very nice, I just cant believe how grown up my little girl is getting. 
<user1> How old is she?
<user0> 6
<user0> May I ask what a cryptokitty is? I am unfamiliar.
<user1> I really couldn't tell you some kind of digital cat, he says he will pay me back, so hopefully it all works out.
<user0> Does he ask for money a lot or is this a first?
<user0> Do you like skydiving?  I would be terrified!
<user1> I'm pretty sure that my greatest fear is my chute not releasing and plunging through the sky into the ground. Oh well you only live once.
<user0> haha, that's true but you can also live with your feet on the ground!
<user0> Haha that's hilarious! Where was it at on your shirt?
<user1> On my back! I went to work like this! 
<user0> Oh no! I hope your coworkers went easy on you about it. You must've had a lot of static electricity.
<user0> How awful!  Do you know who did it?
<user1> Probably a spurned former lover. Glad I had insurance.
<user0> Yes at least there is that.  But it must be really scary to deal with someone willing to go that far.
<user0> It must have been a very difficult  speech, specially since I imagine you were really sad and moved.
<user1> Not really, I just needed to make sure that It goes off without a hitch. I don't want to embarrass my Mother.
<user0> Of course,  do you feel prepared to do it then?
<user0> Wow. That's quite the feat nowadays. Do you still enjoy it?
<user1> Yes I do.  Its a fun job.
<user0> Is it a "never worked a day in your life" situation?
<user1> Yes I am a skydiving instructor so it is fun
<user0> Oh wow, yes I would imagine that is fun. I am jealous.
<user1> Yes I love it
<user1> That is no good!  Did you manage to get on it?
<user0> Yes! Thank goodness. They didn't cancel. I just got home much later than I had hoped.
<user1> That is lucky.  At least you made it home the same day.
<user0> Absolutely. I had too much to do the next day to not show up then.
<user0> LOL, I bet you couldn't move after that.
<user1> I had to go home and lie down for the greatest nap of my life.
<user0> I bet, although with chinese you can eat it again in an hour or so.
<user0> Sounds very nice, you must have felt nostalgic for the old times, right?
<user1> Oh for sure. I'm always a sucker for nostalgia.
<user0> Yes me too, it is for that reason I avoid looking and old pictures when I don't want to go that way.
<user1> I love looking through them. I even find myself clicking back to my oldest pictures on facebook and reliving those times in my head.
<user1> That sounds terrible! you must have been devastated!
<user0> Absolutely. It was really the first time I had lost someone close to me, family or friend.
<user1> It was a terrible way to comes to term with dead, I'm so sorry you have to go through that.  I hope time have healed you.
<user1> I love when I'm at a restaurant and that happens. Happy Birthday, by the way!!
<user0> Hah, its good entertainment, but i don't exactly enjoy being in the spotlight. Thanks!
<user1> Everyone always looks so happy and it makes people around you happy, but I understand not wanting to be in the spotlight
<user1> Congrats! It is nice to find someone with things in common. Shared interests can be fun.
<user0> Thank you. It is nice. This is a second marriage for us both and I like that we are both happy with things just the way they are, no high expectations
<user1> I'm on my 2nd as well. I like to think that we will do things more wisely the second time around. best of luck to you both!
<user1> Oh that is the worse.  Dis you find it at any point?
<user0> My friend freaked out but I was pretty sure I left it at a restaurant and I trusted in my fellow humans to turn it in
<user1> And who was right in this case?  Dis anyone turned it in?
<user0> Yes it was turned in - cash and credit cards all there
<user0> That is so sweet of you! How was your experience?
<user1> It was great. I was with a good group of people too. We made it fun.
<user0> I bet it feels good to know that you're helping those in need, too!
<user1> For sure. I am happy I had the opportunity. Im sure I will do it again.
<user1> That is awesome, having a significant other and a good job can make a huge difference! 
<user0> For sure. I've had some unstable times in my life. I'm thankful to be where I am now.
<user1> Those times can help shape you and make you appreciate the good times even more!
<user0> Absolutely! 
<user1> It is always awesome when work and married life get along, without getting in the way of each other. 
<user1> Oh no! Did it do any meaningful damage?
<user0> The engine is totally shot, its not designed to run without any. So now I have to go shopping for a new car. 
<user1> OUCH. New car is cheaper than replacing the engine?
<user0> The new car is more expensive than a new engine. But I can't justify such a costly repair on my car. 
<user1> Yeah I get that. Plus I guess the value goes way down doing something like that.
<user0> It does drops a lot after a repair like that. I might as well invest that money into something new. 
<user0> Ouch! That must have hurt.
<user1> It hurt my pride more than it hurt my face.
<user0> Don't worry, people won't remember within a few months.
<user1> That is true. Plus it was a big party area so Im sure a lot of them drunk anyway.
<user0> That's what I was thinking.
<user0> Yes I know I am like that too, I can't wait for my new stuff to arrive, I feel like a child on Christmas waiting for Santa's gifts.
<user1> Yes. Every single time. I know better. But I just cant help myself but to check over and over
<user0> I guess it is kind of fun anticipating the arrival of the packages.
<user1> That is true.
<user1> How sad to lose a dog you love! Ta least she/he died of old age, she must be in doggy heaven.
<user0> Yes.  She was the most wonderful dog ever
<user1> I know how you feel, there must be two of them though, because my dog is the most wonderful dog ever too!
<user0> Laugh!  Yes dogs are far better creatures than humans
<user0> That sounds like a great way to spend the weekend.  What type of boat are you thinking about renting?
<user1> Maybe a pontoon boat, depends on what they have. Should be a nice way to unwind.
<user0> Absolutely, nothing like unwinding after the work week.  I hope you'
<user0> Wow, must be nice. My parents were really poor- still are. 
<user1> Mine aren't poor but they aren't loaded. They struggle. Same for me. I work my butt of for what I have.
<user0> Yeah me too. I like that though, I like earning my way. 
<user1> Same. I do wish I had a little bit more money to do a few more things though.
<user0> I often dream about winning the lottery!
<user0> Hey, good for you! That takes stamina. What was the project?
<user1> For sure. It was a software coding project for a client. A lot of which I did not understand at the start.
<user0> Well done! That was a challenge. 
<user1> Thank you. But now I have it ready for the next one.
<user0> It always feels good to wrap up a big project. 
<user0> That's awful!  Will you be feeling better any time soon?
<user1> I am working towards that..I have been lucky to find some great doctors which I am able to put faith in because my life is essentially in their hands
<user0> I am so glad you have doctors that you can trust!
<user0> Uhoh. Hopefully you were able to stick to your diet throughout the week, though. One off day ain't so bad. 
<user1> Yes, otherwise I had stuck to it - but my weekly weigh in was this morning and I was up two pounds. I felt so irritated!!!!
<user0> That sounds it. As long as you keep with it though, results have to happen. The hardest part of dieting has got to be the hiccups, anyway. 
<user0> That's an amazing accomplishment!  I'm sure you'll do great!  Have you been studying a lot?
<user1> I've been studying a WHOLE lot - so I think I'll do okay, but it's still making me feel nervous.
<user0> I hope you can stay calm, you seem really well prepared!
<user0> Oh no,that did not go welll,so sorry about that
<user1> yeah, but i learnt from it and also had a good birthday!
<user0> Thats good dear,congratulations
<user0> It is very important to have a good support system with health issues, especially if there are many. It helps to know that you have people that are there if you need them.
<user1> It really is!  It is wonderful to know how much they love me!
<user0> Health problems can have a devastating effect on a person if they are alone, so it is wonderful that you have love and support.
<user0> Oh. I'm sorry. How old was your dog?
<user1> She was 12.  It was old age but it was so hard because I had had her for years.
<user0> Have you thought about getting another dog? 
<user0> it's a hard decision, you can be apprehensive about making the right decision you know?
<user1> Yeah, it's been a good car so far, but most cars are pretty reliable at first.
<user0> yeah they are! So that is really good!
<user0> That sounds amazing! How'd you guys meet?
<user1> He was my sisters, husbands roomate in college and he came down for their wedding and we met there.  I can't imagine my life without him
<user0> Oh wow, that's awesome. Is your sister as happy with her husband as you are with yours?
<user0> Did you hurt yourself? 
<user1> LOL..just my pride.  I was mortified and the funny part is that later on I won the door prize
<user0> Hahahah! Im dying! Im glad you werent hurt.
<user0> Oh, that sounds so exciting! What do you plan to see while you are there?
<user1> I really want to go to the Smithsonian.  I love history and can't wait till we get to go
<user0> The Smithsonian would be amazing. I have not been to DC yet. I hope you guys have a great time!
<user0> Oh that's really nice to have something you can remember him by. It must be very special to you. 
<user1> It is, it's like he's always with me.
<user0> That's very sweet. I am certain he is with you. 
<user0> Oh my. I am so sorry. That must be so difficult. Are you exploring any other options like adoption? 
<user1> If I can get my health under control I would definetly look into that.  I use to be very sad everytime I saw people with their children but I have finally learned to be content in my situation
<user0> I hope you are able to have a child some day. I truly hurt for anyone that struggles in situations like this. I have to aplogize in advance. The topic I chose was about my daughter. I do not want to make you feel sad. 
<user0> Did you go for the interview?
<user1> yes, I prepared as best I could and I really felt that I aced it!  Sure enough I ended up getting the jon
<user0> Thats lovely,congrats
<user0> I no how you feeI I have had to live in worse places than that , but it looks like you found a way out of that situation.
<user1> What types of situations? And yeah it could have been worse but I'm glad I'm out of it.
<user0> I had to squat in houses before. I'm glad things have changed for you and for me.
<user0> Wow. That's amazing. Were you afraid to try it?
<user1> Yeah the hardest part for me was just realizing that I wouldn't be in control, but it was very natural in the end
<user0> Do you often feel like you want to be in control? Cause i totally do.
<user1> It's like something you have to figure out with your heart, kind of like how caterpillars have to stop trying to do a bunch of work so they can become butterflies
<user1> Lol! Which one was your favorite?
<user0> I don't know if there is one of my favorites, but it sure was a lot of good memories.
<user1> Did you watch Mrs. Doubtfire?
<user1> I hate it when that happens. I hope your pants covered them at least.
<user0> One was pink the other was green. I hope no one noticed.
<user1> That would be embarrassing!
<user1> Oh really? That's cool! What style of dance?
<user0> Well its for a dance off, so it's a pretty big deal I have to win this.
<user1> Wow. That's so amazing. Are you nervous?
<user1> Oh my gosh! When did you figure it out?!
<user0> A couple minutes later
<user1> Wow I'm so sorry. Were you a kid?
<user1> Yeah it can get pretty intense! How did it go?
<user0> I decided not to take the job in the end, I guess I just wanted to know I could get it
<user1> Wow, going out in style! Well I hope you found a good job somewhere.
<user1> Like where you were born?
<user0> For sure, it reminds me that things are always getting better
<user1> Was it a rough place to grow up?
<user1> Wow that's awesome! Are you on a team?
<user0> No, just me, but my 100 yard dash is so so slow, I can't even get lower than 6 seconds.
<user1> I don't know what's good for sprints, I'm more of a distance runner myself.
<user0> I think I'm just really bad, maybe I will always be slow.
<user1> I think you can get better dude!
<user1> That doesn't sound healthy lol. Does it ever make you sick?
<user0> That's not the point, gotta do it RAW
<user1> Are you drinking 2% because you think you're fat? Because you're not. You could drink whole if you wanted to.
<user1> What. I'm confused. What's a juicy pump. Like a juicer?
<user0> My pecs were poppin
<user1> Oh. Hahahahahaha. You go!
<user1> Dang dogs leaving their things around!
<user0> It really hurt, I think I may need to take all his toys away to punish him.
<user1> Yeah, minus one for dogs
<user1> That doesn't sound good, sounds like you are getting replaced.
<user0> Yeah, I demoted her to my dinner girl, now I gotta choose who my main ting is gonna be
<user1> Maybe you should just go single for a while and enjoy freedom.
<user1> What kind of buffet? Did you get to take a doggie bag at least?
<user0> Chinese, but no I decided not to, don't think would allow it
<user1> I bet you wish you had that doggie bag now. My mom used to sneek food out. lol
<user1> Oh my, I hope it was delicious, that is a lot of money
<user0> I thought it would blow my mind but it was dry and really disappointing. Talk about a let down. 
<user1> goodness, i would be so upset, that is a terrible experience!
<user1> Nice, what program are you running
<user0> Steak and Maximum effort. I also drink lots of water, I'm on the next level like Arnold.
<user1> Good game m8, pics or it didn't happen
<user1> Really? I don't find it that scary maybe you just haven't seen true terror.
<user0> Yeah you'll have to show me sometime
<user1> I have a chucky doll sitting in the chair next to me and it looks at me all day. Now thats a movie.
<user1> Oh wow, I wish I could find the courage to do that, it surely takes a lot of will power. how did you do it>
<user0> I closed my eyes and visualize a world where anything was possible. I called this world IMAGINATION land.
<user1> I will totally have to try that, It really is difficult to stop smoking!
<user1> Did you have the choice between truth and dare?
<user0> No, the challenge was I had to spend the night in a cemetery. No flashlight no tents just a rolled up sleeping bag.
<user1> Dang, street cred off the chains right there
<user1> What kind of things do you like to do?
<user0> I like to crochet and pay the bills
<user1> Why do you like to pay the bills, maybe you should just get a rich girl or guy to take care of it.
<user1> Did you have a good workout?
<user0> Indeed, it was quite thrilling, did a little chest workout, got a nice pump
<user1> Nice!  I really need to get back to the gym.
<user1> Oh, that's terrible!  What did you do?
<user0> I clean them up as best I could, and told him about it. Then I profusely apologized.
<user1> Did you figure out what made your cat puke?
<user1> Oh no! What was wrong? Are you feeling better?
<user0> I had an ovarian cyst, it hurt so bad. I almost went to the ER again.
<user1> Oh man! I had one when I was pregnant with my son. I feel your pain!
<user1> Nice, when did you guys break up
<user0> We broke up back in May, he was just too much of a workaholic. 
<user1> I see, you'll find someone better
<user1> Oh, why are you crying? Is anything wrong in particular? Have you talked to somebody?
<user0> Yeah, sometimes it's like a deep sadness comes out of nowhere
<user1> Oh I'm sorry, I hope you get the help that you need.
<user1> Oh no. That's quite unfortunate for the deer. Did you just drive past it?
<user0> Yeah but my widows were down, and I could almost taste the stench of decay.
<user1> I'm sure you wanted to get out of there as soon as possible.
<user1> Do you have a medical condition?
<user0> Nah, I'm trying to gain some pounds, I just haven't acclimated to the quantity yet
<user1> Are you trying to gain muscle?
<user1> I love the USA.  
<user0> It's really moving, wonder what the next big goal will be for humanity
<user1> JFK's speeches were amazing.  We have had a lot of great leaders in our country.  Our country has truly been blessed.  
<user1> Nice, amazing to witness birth
<user0> All of the puppies survived, truly a lucky amazing occasion!
<user1> Good to hear, have fun with puppies!
<user1> wow, who was the won who littered your yard with easter eggs?
<user0> My dad, but he wouldn't admit it! haha
<user1> Nice, he probably made you pick them all up too!
<user1> What made you nervous about it?
<user0> I wasn't sure if it was going to make me sick or not
<user1> I see. Is it your favorite food now? :p
<user1> Were you able to get it back?
<user0> I did but it was ruined from the rain.
<user1> Well, hopefully your friend will forgive you.
<user1> Oh no! I've done that before too
<user0> Hopefully I don't get bad karma for my accidental theft!
<user1> I hope not too!
<user1> A ball, how fancy! Was the girl as stunning as her dress?
<user0> No way, her dress looked like little diamonds had been stitched on every inch of her dress. Not many girls can compete with that. Diamonds are forever.
<user1> Yeah, I  can see a dress like that can easily outshine any girl. The dress sounds amazing though.
<user1> That is crazy. Did you not have insurance for all these years you missed the dentist appointments?
<user0> I do not have insurance. I went anyway because I had a problem with one tooth.
<user1> I hope the problem was not deep in the enamel of the tooth since that requires a lot of work.
<user1> The internet is a great thing. I don't know what we'd do without it.
<user0> True, it's a great resource to have
<user1> We had an issue with our internet for a couple of days and it was so inconvenient!
<user1> I've never felt that way myself. What do you find relaxing about watching animals sleep?
<user0> I don't know, I guess I'm just tired
<user1> I suppose when you feel tired, anything can feel relaxing
<user1> Really? I'm so sorry to hear that
<user0> Yeah. He didn't survive. I really miss him
<user1> Hope everything gets better soon
<user1> Me too, I really miss those days.
<user0> Yea, those were the days
<user1> If only time machines were real.
<user1> It's good to remember days gone by
<user0> It's kind of a bittersweet experience
<user1> Yea, like you can remember those times but things are different
<user1> Taht is always a weight off the shoulders, I'm glad you are pleased.
<user0> Yeah, it was a huge relief for me. I am so glad to be done with this semester.
<user1> I remember that feeling, finals week is so stressful, then there is that wave of relief.
<user1> Did her drive turn out alright?
<user0> Well, let me just say that the pole made it out alright,lol.
<user1> Oh no! Is your daughter okay?
<user0> She is, and now my car has a very crude imitation of a red racing stripe down the side!
<user0> that's great! what motivates you?
<user1> I think just knowing that one day I'll be able to do things that are unimaginable right now, and I know I can do better the next time
<user0> wow that's so motivating, thanks for that i really needed to hear that
<user0> oh that's weird what did you do?
<user1> I just pretended like nothing happened, but i'm worried everyone thinks it was something other than my stomach
<user0> no no, dont
<user0> That's great. You must have been working really hard.
<user1> I like to try my hardest!
<user0> And it has paid off. Good for you.
<user0> Nice! How long do you meditate for?
<user1> I try to go longer everyday, I was able to go 50 minutes yesterday
<user0> Dang! Well I hope you have a stress-free weekend and be full of energy!
<user0> Wow. Dump him and beat him up!
<user1> I think he will dump me soon. He would rather be with her, I just know it
<user0> That is unfortunate, he is a scumbag. I hope you find yourself a nice and wealthy boyfriend!
<user0> Tennis, how fun! Have you noticed improvement?
<user1> yeah I can consistently serve with power and accuracy now. I feel almost decent now.
<user0> That's magnificent! I've never played tennis myself, but it's a sport I've always enjoyed watching.
<user0> That is to bad, is it someone you have been with a long time?
<user1> We were together for a year and a half and we had a child together shortly before I found out!
<user0> Wow, that is really messed up. Did you end up leaving them?
<user0> also nostalgic ey? i get you, those easy days, no stress, no limits, anything is possible 
<user1> No bills to pay, going out to eat with friends all the time, pretty fun
<user0> i wish we could go back to those days... 
<user0> I'm so sorry you had to go through that! What happened?
<user1> Well, I had lots of support from my family, but I felt afraid of getting back into the swing of things for fear of failing. I felt so vulnerable.
<user0> I'm sure it was a very difficult experience. you must be a really strong person to have gotten through that.
<user0> Nice! How long do you go to the gym for?
<user1> Probably half a year, been the most consistent in my life, how about you?
<user0> I never even leave the house! I am the opposite of you!
<user0> That is unfortunate, what do you usually avoid talking about?
<user1> Anything political or religious really, or relationships
<user0> Well I hope one day your parents are more accepting!
<user0> Oh no I am so sorry to hear that. Are you planning on getting  a new dog? 
<user1> Probably not for a while. She was a great companion, but I don't think my heart is ready to bring in a new dog quite yet.
<user0> Aww, yeah I know what you mean. Dogs are so lovable. I also have a new pup myself. I got him a couple years ago
<user0> Oh my, what happened? I'm so sorry, no one should treat anyone they care about poorly.
<user1> They were dishonest and physically cruel. We have gone our separate ways, but I truly hope they can learn to treat others better.
<user0> I'm sorry hun, you deserve to be treated better than that. I hope you know that.
<user0> I'm so sorry, that is the worst feelings. I had to put my dog down as well. I know you did the right thing.
<user1> I know, I just really miss her. Poor cancer kitty. I loved her so much.
<user0> Cats are really some of the greatest companions. How old did she live?
<user0> how did it go?
<user1> It went okay. My cat bopped him a little and growled a lot but no real swipes. So better than expected I guess.
<user0> That's good some things just take time
<user0> I can imagine. How did things turn out?
<user1> I had to have emergency surgery in the end, but being able to hold my healthy baby was the greatest blessing I could have asked for.
<user0> I'm so glad you made it through
<user0> Great what will you be doing during your time off ? 
<user1> I'm not even sure what to do with all this time! I guess I should relax or have some leisure time, but everything in me says to try and be productive even on break. It's that school mentality.
<user0> I agree with you,you'll feel good about yourself being productive !
<user0> That must have been exciting to see her after so long. Does she live very far away?
<user1> Yes she lives on the other side of the country. We had a nice dinner, but my boyfriend is a loud chewer and a sloppy eater. It was quite embarrassing!
<user0> That's a shame. Does your sister have a bad impression of your boyfriend after having dinner with you?
<user0> I love buying new clothes! Where do you think you'll wear it to?
<user1> I'm going to wear it to a party. Everyone will have their eyes on me!
<user0> How exciting! I bet you'll look flawless!
<user0> how has that been going for you?
<user1> Wonderful! It's definitely hard work, but I continue on, even on the days I don't want to. Today I discovered I can now comfortably run an uphill mile and I feel very confident!
<user0> that's amazing!
<user0> nervous?
<user1> A little bit. I am mostly excited about it though
<user0> that's good! excitement and nervousness are both the same, so it's very hard to tell, but it's amazing you are able to convert all the bad feelings into positive ones! good luck 
<user0> That's a great feeling. Going in knowing you'll do well, and then actually doing well.
<user1> If I'm being honest, I made an answer key from the quizzes we took this semester. As they say, work smart, not hard.
<user0> Ingenuity like that will reward you in the real world. Academia is a system, and if you game it, you've won.  
<user0> Oh no! I would be very furuios!
<user1> I was very upset, especially considering how long it took me to get it set up. I loved laying in my peaceful hammock to read.
<user0> I would be devastated! Maybe he wont do it agian.
<user0> Oh wow, I bet that was nice. Hopefully y'all had a good talk.
<user1> We reminisced about old times. It was very nice, indeed. It was nice hearing from him, especially during some rough times!
<user0> Well, that is fantastic. Hopefully y'all will be able to meet up in the future real soon too. 
<user0> That sounds amazing. How are you planning to relax?
<user1> I have some leftover roast in the fridge so I don't even have to leave the house. I'm going to watch a lot of netflix and MAYBE do a little laundry.
<user0> That sounds very relaxing. Don't forget the snacks for netflix!
<user0> that could possibly indicate that you are a free creature! and you don't like to be caged! don't worry about it the dream, as they are only metaphorical
<user1> I hate those dreams, I feel anything but free. They're really uncomfortable and make me nothing but a ball of negative emotions like anxiety as I spend the majority of the dream trying to find clothes and get away from people. 
<user0> Don't worry, you're wearing clothes now aren't you? :)
<user0> Wow that is great for your friend! and don't stress it, we are still young and have plenty of time to save up for a house!
<user1> I'm starting to feel like I will never be able to afford a house. They're just so expensive. And the market has been going up here about 5% a year for the past 10 years.
<user0> Wow that is crazy, I know how you feel, the best solution is to probably find a cheap place to rent out until it is possible to buy one. 
<user0> why is that? comfort ?
<user1> No all my family lives out of state. I didn't feel like traveling, but I just ended up sitting at home and watching lord of the rings in the dark.
<user0> OH NICE! THAT'S SOUNDS SO AMAZING, I love watching lord of the rings every now and then, did you watch all the sequels all over again?
<user0> Wow, that must have been nice to catch up. When was the last time you saw your friend?
<user1> Before 9th grade. I moved away that summer. Seeing her brought back a lot of good memories
<user0> Seeing old friends that you have not contacted in so long is a nice feeling. 
<user0> Really!? That is very unprofessional of them to make you wait for so long.
<user1> It was terrible I ended being late for work because of their horrible service.
<user0> That is frustrating. You should complain to them.
<user0> Oh no, I am sorry that you have been having a rough time, but I am glad to hear that you have grown from your experiances.
<user1> Thank you. I hope that I can move forward and at least learn from these hardships.
<user0> Yeah I believe that you will be able to, but never forget you are not alone! I am always here if you need some moral support :)
<user0> I agree. So often does pride get in the way of personal growth and reflection.
<user1> Absolutely. Yet, these people have a horrible way of twisting things in order to guilt you, even if you'd done nothing wrong! It's a very manipulating and confusing feeling.
<user0> You'd hope folks would grow up, but sometimes people get set in their ways, and become impossible to change.
<user0> Oh no, what did they say? 
<user1> They were just trying to find ways to contact me. I have literally blocked them on all social media. It seems borderline stalkish, and it makes me very anxious.
<user0> That is really creepy, I would feel anxious too. I think you should report the to the police if you notice any strange or threatening messages,Feel free to also call me if you need anything! :)
<user0> That sounds fun and scary! You must be pretty fit to take on that challenge.
<user1> I have done some climbing indoors for practice, but never done a big climb out doors, so who know how it will go.
<user0> I'm sure that there will be some differences, but I'm sure you will nail it! Just remember to be safe!
<user0> oh my, what are they about?
<user1> I'm usually in a big city that I'm familiar with, and roam around in the dream until I get stalked, jumped, and sometimes very hurt.
<user0> wow sounds like some inception plot line, you need to learn how to control the dream
<user0> Sound like you're making a lot of progress!
<user1> I sure have, but it's such hard work. I make sure to work out, even on the days that I don't want to. It's definitely taken a lot of will power.
<user0> That's great! All the hard work is paying off.
<user0> Congrats, that must have been a very stressful time leading up the the birth.
<user1> It was a really rough pregnancy that ended with a very painful surgery. It was not pretty, but definitely worth it. I would have taken any amount of pain as long as my son was born healthy and safe.
<user0> You sound like a great mother. I'm sure your son is very lucky to have you.
<user0> Wow that sounds challenging! You must have some serious strength to pull that off!
<user1> I never thought I would have the balance to perform such a feat. I think I can no qualify for the Olympics. 
<user0> You should definitely try! It would be tough, but if you have the determination, it would be so worth it.
<user0> Oh no! You should try to make some more friends with your classmates.
<user1> That sound like a good idea if they weren't online classes. Next semester I have a few on campus courses, so I'm hoping I'll be able to make at least one new friend.
<user0> I hope you're able to find some friends in the next semester then!
<user0> Yeah that sounds hectic. You think you can do it?
<user1> I'm not sure. The more I think about it, the more I doubt myself. I also have a baby, so I'm hoping I'll be able to juggle everything at once.
<user0> Yeah sounds like a handful! Maybe you should weigh your options and do whats best for you adn your family. 
<user0> That is great to here!
<user1> Thank you. Do you have a romantic interest?
<user0> Not at the moment. I'm too focused on bettering myself.
<user0> I'm from the south too! Are you talking about mosquitoes by any chance?
<user1> Mosquitoes, and those dreadful flying ants. They're everywhere!
<user0> One day we'll find a way to repay them all the misery they've caused us.
<user0> Keep up the good work! You will do good in life and be a good role model for your kids. 
<user1> Thank you! I definitely have a drive to feel strong for them. I hope some day they can realize my efforts.
<user0> They will notice how caring you are! Dont ever cut yourself short!
<user0> That does sound like a good friend. How long of a drive is that?
<user1> It is an 8 hour drive! Florida is a very long state
<user0> You're lucky to have such a good friend!
<user0> Oh no! I've been there. How did it happen?
<user1> It was very wet and I took a turn at too high of a speed.
<user0> I'm glad your safe! Those roads can be dangerous.
<user0> I hope that your relationship continues to strengthen.
<user1> Thank you. I know that, even though it's challenging, I need to be patient in order to improve our relationship.
<user0> I agree. Life is short and having these relationships is very important
<user0> Oh no! I hope it dont bite anyone. That can be nervwrecking.
<user1> She's never bitten anyone, thankfully, but she gets crazy with other rats. To my surprise though, I've recently found her snuggling with the others she usually tries to fight!
<user0> Im glad it worked out well. I bet your finally content with her being around other rats. 
<user0> That's neat and sounds like a lot of fun!
<user1> It was amazing. The last time I was at an amusement park had to have been over a decade ago!
<user0> I have not been in years! Was it as fun this time as it was years ago?
<user0> What kind of pet is it? Hope your animal is okay!
<user1> She's a rat, so her body is very frail. I'm sad that she likely will not make it. She's been with me through thick and thin.
<user0> I heard rats make awesome pets, I'm so sorry! Is your rat in pain?
<user0> I'm sure with the help and support he will be alright..
<user1> I hope so. I think that time heals all wounds.
<user0> Definitely, I think so too, time and right care.
<user0> Oh my! I hope you were the only one there! otherwise that would have been scary!
<user1> I was not, unfortunately. People saw everything!
<user0> Oh my god! How embarrassing! Looksl like you will stay inside for awhile.
<user0> Wow, that's so sad. Hopefully a new love will come to you!
<user1> I think so. I have plenty of time and life goes
<user0> Sure, it's never too late. And you never know what's gonna happen soon.
<user0> Very nice! I bet your very proud of it and are excited for what may come from it.
<user1> I am very excited. It is almost an hour and a half long
<user0> I bet you worked very hard on it! It will be great!
<user0> Wow! That sounds exciting! Have you traveled around the world a lot?
<user1> I have! I actually grew up in Saudi Arabia
<user0> Traveling is the best way to learn about other cultures. You are very fortunate to get the opportunity. 
<user0> I agree, we need more moral people to guide us.
<user1> I think so too. There are some kind and great people in the world
<user0> Let's hope they find their way to the top soon for our sake.
<user0> Did anything happen?
<user1> No, everything was fine, but it was a chilling experience
<user0> Oh, I'm sure. At least everything ended up alright though.
<user0> Oh man, that's funny and terrible at the same time.
<user1> It was really gross. I had to keep my dog from licking my face for a long time after that.
<user0> Yeah, I would keep away from him for another 2 months or so.
<user0> what was it?
<user1> She would give hundreds of dollars of school supplies to kids in need each year.
<user0> wow, that's an amazing woman. did she rub off on you any?
<user1> She did! I fill stockings around the holidays and go around on Christmas giving them out to people who have to work. :)
<user0> that's pretty cool of you. i hope to have a daughter like you someday
<user0> Oh that's exciting! Are you nervous at all?
<user1> Not too much, just really exciting. I'm planning everything even though it's months away, even the menu.
<user0> Oh wow, it sounds like you really love them. I'm super happy for you! I hope it goes exactly how you planned. You sound like a good father.
<user0> oh man. it's always tough to lose a parent. how old is she?
<user1> She's 87, so she has lived a long life, but she has Alzheimers, and it's really sad to watch her lose her mind.
<user0> yeah i bet. at least you got to know her for as long as you did
<user1> That's a great way of looking at it. I should try to keep a positive attitude towards it.
<user0> yep she's want you to remember that, even if she can't remember it herself
<user0> that's very dangerous , driving and being exhausted did you manage to get home safe?
<user1> I did get home safe but it was scary because the roads were two lane and lots of 18-wheelers were heading in the opposite direction. I kept thinking I would swerve into their lane and collide into them
<user0> i'm glad you didn't 
<user0> That's nice to hear.  It's always a good thing in a marriage to show each other support through thick and thin.
<user1> Yes - so true. His mom is dying, and he is working long hours on top of it. I feel really bad for him.
<user0> I'm sorry to hear that.  Just knowing that he has you to lean on probably goes a very long way in helping him get through that.
<user0> Oh no! Were you envious because you liked her yourself, or because you don't have a wealthy husband?
<user1> She drove up in a fancy car and seems like she doesn't have a care in the world. I wish that were me some days.
<user0> It can be you, you just have to work hard for it.
<user0> i feel bad for your friend. did you tell her?
<user1> I didn't know what to say to her, and was afraid she wouldn't believe me and it would cause her to be angry at me. It's a bad situation. 
<user0> oh god, that sounds terrible
<user0> oh that's so embaressing 
<user1> I know! I was super afraid of my teacher, and was scared to ask her to go to the bathroom.
<user0> why are were you scared? don't be next time stand up and ask your teacher you want to go to the toilet otherwise you will wet your pants
<user1> She was really mean and always yelling! I didn't want her to yell at me. I'm much older and wiser now!
<user1> That's hilarious! Is he usually down for a good prank?
<user0> I'm not sure he likes being the target of pranks, but he likes to prank me and this prank is to get back at him for a prank he pulled on me and my cousin
<user1> Well, that's fair. If he pulls them, he has to be willing to have them pulled on him, too.
<user1> Why's that?
<user0> I'd been wanting to do that trip with my kids for years. I'm happy for her- just wish it could have been me.
<user1> I can understand that. It's a tough trip to make, but hopefully you'll be able to soon.
<user1> and how was it? did you enjoy it?
<user0> I had a blast. I met people from all over the country, visited many historical sites, and learned a lot about how government works 
<user1> and how was it? did you enjoy it?
<user1> That sounds like so much fun! I love parties!
<user0> I'm really happy about it- she's a great friend and she's turning 40, so it's a big one!
<user1> Hey, I just had that one! What do you have planned?
<user0> About 20 friends, surprising her at her favorite bar after work. 
<user0> That sounds like fun! Are you looking forward to seeing anyone in particular?
<user1> Honestly? There was this girl who really treated me poorly - I can't wait for her to see how successful I have been!
<user0> Well I hope she's there. Maybe she'll regret how she treated you.
<user0> Oh no! Hurricanes are scary.  I've been through a few myself.  Was it your first one?
<user1> It was my third. Luckily we didn't lose power for more than a few hours
<user0> I lost power in our last hurricane for 3 days.  Did the wind do any damage to your home?
<user1> It damaged the roof and the fence. We lost power for six days during the first hurricane I experienced
<user0> In the end, I'd rather be  in a hurricane than a snow storm.  lol
<user0> Wow,  you are a vegetarian? 
<user1> If I already have 10 years of vegetarian
<user0> This is serious.  For me,  I don't joke with meat
<user1> I healthy physically and spiritually
<user1> that must've made you so furious
<user0> I was super angry, yes! I ended up grounding her for three weeks- one week for each hour she was late.
<user1> you sure are a very strict parent.
<user1> That's great! I'm sure you'll be well prepared. 
<user0> I think so- I've studied quite a bit with my husband and others.
<user1> Then I am sure it will go well for you. What is it in?
<user0> Education- teaching license certification
<user0> Wow,  what happened to her eyes? 
<user1> They are sick
<user0> Ohhh sorry about that. It is well. 
<user1> Relax, they are things that happen
<user1> That's got to be an amazing feeling to have going for you. How do you feel?
<user0> I feel very grateful that he has been so generous.
<user1> It's going to help your family out so much I bet everyone is so proud of you, congrats you deserve it.
<user1> That's rough, I'm sorry to hear that
<user0> That's fine, its not your problem. i just feel very lonely right now.
<user1> I am sure you will find someone who will love you even more than your ex did soon.
<user1> That's too bad, you have to go out and make new friends.
<user0> Yeah, it's hard though. I hate to go out by myself. It's hard for me to meet new people
<user1> Suck it up and get out there, it is the only way or you will end up very lonely.
<user1> Oh I'm so sorry to hear that!
<user0> I don't know what happened. I studied and passed everything else. Now I have to retake the class and I'm upset
<user1> Is there somewhere you can go for extra help with that course? A tutor or something?
<user1> That's so annoying.  I hate it when that happens.
<user0> It drives me bonkers when she does that
<user1> Can you block her out, maybe?  Get some noise blocking headphones?
<user1> The ones with the little colored sliders on the end? Those were cool!
<user0> Yes! My mom used to always get me one each year before school started. Those were the coolest pens in the world!
<user1> I liked them too.
<user1> Has it been on the market for long?
<user0> Only a week- and 17 people have seen it already, so I'm feeling good about it selling quickly!
<user1> Wow! That's awesome. I'm sure you'll sell soon.
<user1> oh that's too bad, what did you end up doing
<user0> Nothing- I still haven't seen her. I felt pretty let down - but hopefully I can make the trip to see her soon.
<user1> you should defently and don't let this affect you too much, maybe she has a good reason
<user1> that must have been an explosion and a half, did  you clean it up?
<user0> Fortunately no- she cleaned it up. But she had just had spaghetti and it was floating in it. It was so gross!
<user1> i can imagine, that's gross as hell
<user1> oh no! that's terrible! I've had that happen before and it sucks
<user0> I heard it was happening in other areas but didn't expect it here because we live in a nice neighborhood. So frustrating
<user1> I can imagine. did they steal anything?
<user1> I know what you mean.  I love to see all the pictures, and think back to how little mine used to be.
<user0> I would cry the first day of school every year, especially the milestone years. Now my grandchildren are starting school. Time flies by too quickly
<user1> They do seem to be grown before you know it.  Make you wonder how if goes so fast!
<user1> Sometimes it's ok to indulge. Did it give you a stomachache though lol?
<user0> LOL, I swear it was like I sat down and they were gone!  Probably gave myself diabetes. So not going to be able to eat the rest of the day!
<user1> You should follow up with a few veggies later on maybe to balance it out. I know that feeling though. Its just so good you can't eat just one lol
<user0> Sigh, I have no self control, definatley need a veggie or two today now! Probably should knix those form the pantry
<user0> I'm so sorry for your loss! It's so hard to lose a parent.
<user1> I didn't think it would hit me hard. I felt like I was prepared. 
<user0> Sadly, I don't think we can ever be prepared for that kind of loss.
<user0> Wow,  that's so nice of you
<user1> She works nights, and had no idea I was coming. I knew she had a bad night so I wanted to do something nice for her.
<user0> That is cool.  You are really so caring 
<user0> Oh darn, that sucks.  Keeping a positive attitude is the way to go! I'm sure something is out there for you.
<user1> I keep looking and applying, but still here I sit. I know it will happen when the right one comes along though
<user0> And here the job market was supposed to get great again.  lol
<user0> Oh no! Can you replace it?
<user1> I'm trying to find a new one, but this one was rare and hard to find. 
<user0> I'm sure your friend will be understanding that it was a mistake.
<user0> oh no I am sorry to hear that! They must have been really busy and it must have slipped their mind
<user1> I guess I shouldn't expect so much from them and let myself get let down like I have.
<user0> I am sure they had their reasons, maybe you should give them a call and see if everything is alright. They may be going through their own problems right now. 
<user0> I agree. The sound of birdsong, a gentle breeze on a summer's day, the purring of your tabby-cat. You can't beat that, can you?
<user1> Those examples are definitely the simple pleasures of life. It makes me want to go outside and listen to the birds and smell the flowers.
<user0> You should! Forget about your worries, if only for a moment. You'll return feeling refreshed.
<user0> Yikes, that's not a fun situation. Did you figure it out pretty quickly?
<user1> Yes I did realize fairly fast why everyone was staring. I looked down and seen my breast exposed. 
<user0> That's good, I'd be mortified if that happened to me.
<user0> I've had that happen before. My cat is definitely more my wife's cat now. Does he still cuddle up with you?
<user1> Yea he loves to sit on my lap while i work, but prefers her side of the bed now when he sleeps. 
<user0> Haha, same for me. It's like as soon as my wife is available to sit or lay with, I'm chopped liver.
<user0> I'm sorry for your loss, I bet you two were close. What did he leave you?
<user1> Some interesting antiques, grandfather clocks, and a lot of items related to his work for the house of representatives. Interesting stuff
<user0> Oh he worked for congress? That's very interesting. That sounds like an awesome haul of vintage stuff.
<user0> That was kind of you! Has his truck been repaired?
<user1> Yeah it has. And, he took good care of my car, as always.
<user0> Of course! Your dad is very trustworthy.
<user0> Can you please give a little more detail about what happened at your friends house that made you not want to show your face??
<user1> Sure, I fell asleep on the chair and had a dream, in my dream I went to the restroom, so yeah, I peed right there in their chair.
<user0> How embarrassing! I did that one time when I was sleeping in my bed and I thought I got up and went to the bathroom to pee, but I did not go to the bathroom, I peed my pants in the bed. 
<user1> Yes, it was not fun, but good to know I am not the only one.
<user1> That is so cool, my mother in law has bears come into her yard! I'd be happy with the hummingbirds, so pretty.
<user0> I just have the small non dangerous type of wildlife that I like to help Birds, rabbits, squirrels and such. No big bad bears! 
<user1> The squirrels keep stealing the feed in my birdfeeder, they do trapeze to get to it.
<user1> That's amazing! We just got a new puppy this last weekend also! What kind is yours?
<user0> Its a long hair chihuahua and a short hair chihuahua. He has the most adorable under bite!
<user1> Aw that is super cute! Dogs bring such happiness to a home.
<user1> Oh man, I'm really sorry you have to go through that. Betrayal like that is so painful. How are you doing?
<user0> I'm learning to live my live without her, it's tough. Some honesty would have made the way it ended much better. Thanks for the kind words.
<user1> Of course, no one deserves to have their heartbroken like that. I hope you find someone who treats you with the respect and kindness you deserve.
<user1> Sugar is very addicting! I'm glad you could make it
<user0> Yeah me too. The lack of caffeine made me get a bad headache that took three days to get rid of.
<user1> Caffeine headaches are no joke.
<user0> No, they suck!!
<user0> Sounds like you were just misunderstood. I discuss things with my husband, too, and it's not like talking behind someone's back. That's what married couples do. Don't feel bad. 
<user1> Yeah, I just felt like I set a bad example for my daughter, even thought she misunderstood. I guess it was a teachable moment though..
<user0> Yes, just tell her your home is a safe place to talk. It's okay to open up in the family. 
<user1> That's good advice. Thanks!
<user1> Awesome! Did you play any of them after you found the box?
<user0> I did, i played a few sessions of age of empires and i plan to play some command and conquer red alert tonight before bed, still great games.
<user1> Neat! I haven't played them. Even though everything is becoming digital, I find there is something special about the physical copies!
<user1> Ugh, sorry! You must be disappointed. But remember if the door doesn't open, it probably wasn't yours. There's something else in store for you!
<user0> Thanks.  But yes, I was really dejected.  I thought I'd interviewed well and had a good enough resume.
<user1> Sometimes they already have a candidate in mind but have to go through the motion...the same thing happened to my husband. Your time will come.
<user1> I can't even imagine how devastating that would be. I think you must be really strong to be able to move forward.
<user0> Well, Like the saying goes, get busy living or get busy dying. I'm not sure if i'll ever find someone i truly love but life goes on!
<user1> You might, but I believe you can have a full life as a single person, too.
<user1> Wow! A 20 foot boat, that must be amazing to take out on the lake! How much did it cost you?
<user0> It cost me around $30,000. It has all the latest features, that should keep me safe in all but the most extreme conditions. 
<user1> Id love to own a boat, are you using it for leisure or fishing etc? 
<user0> It has been a dream of mine for a long time. I am mainly going to use it for fishing. But might have to take my wife tubing to make her happy. 
<user1> They both sound like great plans! Tubing would be a great way to keep her happy while you fish haha!
<user0> We should have a lot of fun this summer with it! Makes up for all the hard work saving up for it. 
<user1> I hope you do! It makes you feel like you've actually earned it!
<user1> I'm always leery of loaning money to friends
<user0> Yeah, I meant don't like, sorry. I recently lent some to my friend with no expectation of getting it back because of her hard situation. I actually got it back.
<user1> That was a nice surprise!  I have tried lending money to friends but finally had to stop after never getting it back
<user1> Oh no! How sad! Did you ever find him?
<user0> After a week of looking for him and checking the shelters, a neighbor found his body under her house. He had gotten under there and couldn't find a way out. I was so heart broken and so were my daughters.
<user1> Oh, how awful! I'm so sorry!
<user1> Wow, very cool. The last time i tried to skateboard i almost broke my tailbone. props to you though!
<user0> It can be scary some times, but its worth it.
<user1> Is it though? haha. If you can do it without falling down then you are doing better than me. Probably a good bonding experience i'd imagine. 
<user1> Too bad for them! My sons 6th birthday was just last week, and we had a fun party. There so much easier to please when their little lol.
<user0> Hah yea, she was sad at first but there was plenty of presents and people who love her around to distract her. They grow up fast. 
<user1> They do. I can't believe how fast the time goes.
<user1> That must have been aggravating! Job hunting is so hard.
<user0> It would have been nice. Less pay, but I would have had to work less. Oh well, guess I'll try harder next time.
<user1> Maybe something better will come along!
<user1> Well I hope you got there in time and nothing bad happened.
<user0> I did but when after I was out for a while I noticed the shirt I was wearing was covered in grease stains. I apparently washed it with my husbands work clothes.
<user1> Oh know! I hope you weren't heading to a job interview, haha.
<user1> I'm so sorry. Have you tried any natural remedies?
<user0> No, I've tried science remedies. I like those kinds better.
<user1> I hope you find something that gives you some relief!
<user1> That's awesome. Did you get him it? I bet he loves it.
<user0> No, his grandpa did. But, after he went to bed, I went outside and played with it for a while.
<user1> Haha I would've done the same. Those toys always make me lose myself. They're so much fun!
<user1> Wow you were lucky! It has happened to me before too. It feels so violating.
<user0> I know! I feel both violated and kind of sad because I have nothing in my car worth stealing.
<user1> Because you were not in it. :)
<user1> That is so nice of you all! I know she appreciates it.
<user0> When I saw that she needed help, I always tried to give her directions based on where she was with her walker. I liked helping her. She recently passed away and I miss her.
<user1> Aww, I'm so sorry but know you made a difference in her life.
<user0> Yes, she loved everyone she met. She would say she couldn't remember everyone's names, but she loved them anyway.
<user0> that is good! did he make any friends?
<user1> You bet! He made a girlfriend on the bus by talking about Zelda.
<user0> That is really cute!
<user0> That's awesome! Whats your secret to success?
<user1> We have just been trusting in the Lord.
<user0> Well he seems to be guiding you in the right direction. I hope your blessings continue!
<user1> Thank you.
<user1> First day of school I remember ,my kids first day of school, how did it make you feel?
<user0> It just gave me the feeling that time flies by too quickly sometimes.  My youngest in the pic was in first grade and his older sister was in 7th grade.
<user1> yes it does but we always got or memories.
<user0> And tons of pics!  I try to take pictures of everything.
<user0> Neither could I.  It was the first thing that was on the news right after I woke up.
<user1> Sometimes you think people will be around forever, their aura is just so...legendary.
<user0> Yea, I try not to think about that though because then it makes me sad.
<user0> That sounds amazing! How long does it take to make the beans? Do you have to soak them? 
<user1> I had to soak them for 3 hours.  I think that's what makes that meal so satisfying - the wait!
<user0> I can smell the beans and sausage as we speak.. I always find after cooking I'm never hungry. Maybe that's because I snacked the entire time I was cooking.
<user1> I do the same thing!
<user1> Oh no.  In those cases, it's either the best news or the worst news.
<user0> Yeah, it really is. Due to a technicality custody is reverting to their father.
<user1> I'm sorry to hear that.  Unfortunately, I know that same feeling all too well.
<user1> Woo hoo! That is awesome! Congrats! When will you find out/
<user0> I should know something by tomorrow morning.  Hopefully they tell me right away.
<user1> I hope so too! I'll be sure to keep my fingers crossed for you! Good luck!
<user1> Good think you're prepared 👍
<user0> I think I am.  I tried to do as much in advance as I could.
<user1> Hopefullybeveryday goes well.
<user1> Oh no!  That's such a shame.  Did you go to the principal?
<user0> Yes, and will again because it didn't help. I try to cheer her up with hugs, goofy moments, and whatever else I can think of.
<user1> I'm so sorry!  I hope it gets better for her.  Middle school is no picnic, that's for sure.
<user1> Oh no! That's horrible. Please tell me you didn't. 
<user0> I did not. I left there quickly. It was not something I would ever want to do.
<user1> Awww, that is awesome! I am so proud of you! 
<user1> that is so sad i hope your pet gets better
<user0> She did get better eventually.  During that time I tried to tend to her as much as I could.
<user1> that is so sweet, i think that is why she got better, your caring ways
<user1> Do you like cats? Kittens are the best!
<user0> I love cats, I have one of my own. I haven't been around a kitten in forever so it's a real treat. I also don't have to sleep with the little brat at night either so it's especially great.
<user1> Yes I love cats as well I have one orange one and 4 dogs that get along pretty well all together
<user1> Congrats!  How long have you been playing the cello?
<user0> I have been playing the cello for 5 years.
<user1> How did you place in the competition?
<user1> Oh dear that's embarrassing! I hope you didn't hurt yourself. 
<user0> Just my pride
<user1> Oh ha! I guess that's painful!
<user1> I am sorry. Breakups are the worst. Did he just not want to give up overtime or he worked 70hours always?
<user0> He claims that he kept getting raises and felt obligated to work even harder. So he just kept working more and more and I rarely got to spend time with him and he was always tired.
<user1> That's rough but you deserve someone who is willing or wants to make the time for you. Never settle for less than what you are willing to settle for.
<user1> Why did yall break up?
<user0> The straw that broke the camels back is that he broke a promise that he would leave his job if they were over working him too much. He decided he didn't want to leave after all and wants to keep working 70+ hour weeks every week.
<user1> That doesnt leave much time for yalls relationship
<user1> Oh darn I hate when that happens! I've experienced the same thing in the past once.
<user0> Yeah it was pretty terrible. I had to throw out a TON of food, and to add insult to injure I had to go eat out tonight.
<user1> Yep not always a terrible time to eat out at least.
<user1> How did they do?
<user0> Awesome. I usually have a hard time letting anyone watch my child but he had a great time with her.
<user1> How old's your child?
<user0> 5
<user1> Just barely older than my son. I can definitely understand that.
<user1> what happened why were their so many dead fish?
<user0> I don't know, that's what I would like to know! The best I can imagine is that the water quality dropped, and they died. I imagine it was pollution. 
<user1> I hope they are not using the lake for drinking water .
<user1> Good luck! I'm sure it will be fine.
<user0> I just don't want to embarrass myself or my team. I'm so scared i'm going to make a fool of myself. 
<user1> You're too hard on yourself. Everyone messes up sometimes, even the greats.
<user1> Yikes that's no good. How many stitches did you have to get?
<user0> I had to get 2 stitches in one of the holes and 1 stitch and all the other holes. He was a big dog, a little over 50 pounds.
<user1> What happened to the dog afterwards?
<user1> That's quite the win! What was the bet?
<user0> I made a bet that he would not lose 20 pounds in 3.5 months. I was hoping that he would win the bet, but on the bright side I got a switch :) Win-win for me.
<user1> Oh! Gotcha! I've never played the switch but I heard it's an exciting console!
<user1> Oh cool, where does your friend live? Is it an exciting location?
<user0> Yes, I mean I promised her I would  and some things came up but I know I gotta stick to my word and make this happen.
<user1> Oh man, don't bail on your trip. Try and get those thing that came taken care of this week. You don't want to disappoint her.
<user0> Oh I know I can't. She had lots of plans for us.
<user0> Oh no, I bet your parents were freaking out.
<user1> Yeah I guess they were, they made sure to spank me and ground me for 2 weeks. I was also told that I was a terrible influence on my 9 year old cousin, even though I was 7 and it was his idea. 
<user0> Oh that sucks getting blamed for it when it was their fault.
<user0> Do you get much use out of it, or is it just collection dust?
<user1> Kind of just dust. It meant a lot to her that I have it so I just don't think I can let it go.
<user0> I guess you can hang on to it, or maybe there's someone else you both know who can show it some proper lovin'.
<user0> well dang! that is very impressive! 
<user1> Yeah I know, I'm really amazed and proud of him. To be honest as proud as I am I can't help but to be a little jealous too lol.
<user0> Understandable, i bet the had good budgeting skills and a nice job.
<user0> Oh no!! That is terrible, do you know what happened? 
<user1> My younger brothers went in my room and messed with all my things. I am so angry about it
<user0> Oh no, I am sure they meant no harm, they always say that they are more curious when they are young. 
<user0> It will pass in time, even though it feels awful right now.
<user1> I hope so, I'm tired of feeling so miserable. I just wish I had someone here with me right now. 
<user0> Aw I'm sorry. I remember feeling like that and it was horrible.
<user0> Oh that's great! 9 years together is a long time. You sound happy, I'm glad.
<user1> Yes I love a good day of relaxation and family time :)
<user0> What did y'all do? Did you do anything special that evening? 
<user1> Yes, dinner :)
<user1> Oh, I know exactly what you mean. It's not the same as going as a kid.
<user0> The enclosures all just seemed so tiny and it felt like none of the animals were able to have any privacy if they wanted it. 
<user1> Yeah, it's no wonder these animals go crazy on humans sometimes.
<user1> Wow! what did you write about?
<user0> I wrote about social security reform. Kinda boring stuff lol but it'll be fun to visit all the sites in DC
<user1> Nice, well I hope you have a nice trip!
<user1> Congrats! That's exciting. Is the new place far from your current home?
<user0> Yes, a new state. I am just imagining all the fun things and new things we can do.
<user1> Wow, thats really big! I hope you have a stress free move. I know it can be a little stressful, but you seem very excited!
<user1> Wow, really? Did you have any feelings for him? 
<user0> No, the whole thing was really weird and kind of embarrassing really. He sat in the desk in front and would turn around and basically ask me to kiss him in front of the whole class. I only knew him from that class. I usually would just smash my binder in his face instead.
<user1> Hahaha, that is so cute, I am sure he loved that you teased him like that! I bet your classmates also had a good laugh! 
<user1> Wow! What field are you going to be working in?
<user0> Statistics. I am going to help a real estate company build models to predict house values
<user1> Dang! I hope you make lots of money!
<user1> Wow! Congrats to her, and I am sorry that you didn't get the prize. What did she win? 
<user0> A weekend trip to Gatlinburg. I would of loved that.
<user1> Wow that is a great prize! Is she able to take anyone with her or is it just a ticket for one person? 
<user0> She is but she's taking her husband :)
<user0> Wow, were you at a festival?
<user1> Yes I was. I thought it was pretty intense to watch
<user0> I have seen that before. I have no idea how they can do that.
<user0> o That sounds exciting. Moving or spring cleaning?
<user1> Moving, not sure when yet but I like to be  ahead of the game. I hate being rushed.
<user0> Ya last time I moved I was packing for about 6 months. It's smarter to do it a little at a time and get things purged and organized. 
<user0> Oh no that is terrible, I can not believe that they would drive off without leaving any contact information! How bad was the accident? 
<user1> Huge dent, I can't believe someone could do that and drive off.
<user0> Wow, that is terrible. I hope that you are able to catch them or find surveillance videos of who did it, because most malls do have cameras in the parking lots.
<user0> Aww were you excited when you picked her up?
<user1> Oh man, I sure was. And she was so excited to get out of that box.
<user0> I bet! What kind of dog is she?
<user0> Uh oh, be careful about that, you don't want him becoming dependent on you for handouts. 
<user1> Yeah I don't do that often, but i am certain he will be able to pay me back this time
<user0> Well that's good. I hope it works out for both of you, maybe you could give him some budgeting tips. 
<user0> Oh my god, you should have reported her.
<user1> I definitely stepped in and made sure this man knew he didn't deserve that. Just makes me so mad to share a country with people like that.
<user0> I am really appalled at people these days.
<user0> Where to?
<user1> Not sure yet, waiting to find all of that out. I hate waiting though.
<user0> Me too. Well I hope it is to somewhere that you like.
<user0> I'm sorry to hear that.  Hopefully something similar comes along sooner than later.
<user1> I really hope so. I was really wanting that job.
<user0> Just remember to keep your head up and don't give up!
<user0> I do hope they stopped the car at least ! That sounds disgusting, but its better than throwing up in the car right ?
<user1> Yes they were at a stop light but I was so grossed out after seeing that.
<user0> I can imagine when something unexpected like that happens. I do hope they are ok now :) Sorry you had to witness that !
<user0> New adventures! I want to go west.
<user1> I don't know where I want to go, just want to know where they are sending us :)
<user0> I bet you are nervous.
<user0> Oh no. I bet they are going to charge you for a new one.
<user1> Yeah. I feel pretty bad about it. 
<user0> Maybe they will understand.
<user0> Aww. I had to put mine down last month. I miss her.
<user1> I'm sorry to hear that. What kind of dog was she?
<user0> Border collie. She was great!
<user0> What kind of job did you get?
<user1> I got a job in statistics
<user0> What do you do as a statistic
<user0> How do you think it will go? Are you confident?
<user1> I think I will do really well. I feel prepared for it.
<user0> What subject is it?
<user0> Uh oh. What happened?
<user1> He got drunk and took it for a joyride. It didn't end well.
<user0> That is horrible! I hope he was okay.
<user0> well that's good to hear I guess. what do you do?
<user1> I work in public relations. I create campaigns for companies.
<user0> what's your most successful campaign so far?
<user1> I recently did a very successful one for a medical company.
<user0> I always need convincing to take my yucky medicine
<user0> that's amazing! what kind of job is it?
<user1> It's a statistical analyst job.
<user0> i'm glad your interview went well, and i really hope you get that call soon!
<user0> you can always make new friends, and talk to your old friends at the same time!
<user1> That's very true. It'll just take some time.
<user0> yeah but you never know , you may make life changing friendships so be patient!
<user0> You gotta stick with what you know sometimes.
<user1> Yes, why try something new when what you have been using has worked so well. 
<user0> That's right. There's so sense in deviating. 
<user1> I have to show some brand loyalty! 
<user1> I feel you there, I have a ton of stuff to do, but I can't get any of it done in this rain. 
<user0> It sucks. Maybe it'll be dry this weekend.
<user1> I really hope so, I am not sure how much longer I can let my yard grow before it gets too wild. 
<user1> oh I am so sorry. That must be fresh on your heart, may he rest in peace.
<user0> It is just so sad to have my loyal companion taken away like that. 
<user1> I can only imagine. I am so sorry. What was his name?
<user0> His name was Han Solo, I am a huge Star Wars fan. My wife thought it was a dorky name, but I loved it. 
<user0> That is great to be prepared. Where do you live?
<user1> South Alabama, near the Gulf.
<user0> Oh yeah, you definitely need to be prepared. Do you think you will get a hurricane?
<user0> Wow, see enjoyment.
<user1> She is such a blessing to me and spoils me so much. 
<user0> You are so lucky. Some men pray for that kind of wife
<user1> Yeah, I try to treat her the best I can, can't lose someone that amazing. 
<user1> What kind of illness occurs if food is cross contaminated? I'm so sorry this happens to you.
<user0> If it's mild, just stomach pains for a few days.  If I were to say, eat a bun that was supposed to be gluten free and it was full gluten, my joints also inflame.  So you see it can affect more than just my stomach!
<user1> You suffer from it more severely than most people I know, this can be devastating to people. 
<user0> Inflammation is the devil.  I'm just glad I found out how to manage it to improve my quality of life.
<user0> Wow that is weird.  I love Diet Coke.  What was wrong with it?
<user1> I was concerned they were the wrong drink order, we lined them up and talked to the server and together figured out the syrup bag must be going empty!
<user0> Nothing worse than a bad soda! lol.  I like the new Freestyle machines, it's always just right.
<user0> aww. I understand you. That feeling is priceless.
<user1> It definitely triggers some emotions!  Then I'm torn between keeping it a little longer or finally purging.
<user0> It's alright to feel such sentiments buddy :)
<user0> Yum!!! I love pancakes. Is it your favorite food too?
<user1> One of my favorite breakfast foods. She also made some thick sliced bacon. She treats me so well.
<user0> That is great you have a sweet wife! 
<user1> For sure, no other woman I would rather have. 
<user0> It is so great to hear about a happy couple :)
<user1> How can I complain when she gets up early to make me such a great meal!
<user0> I bet she is a great cook!
<user0> That sounds exciting! Is he good at keeping secrets?
<user1> He lets things slip once in a while, but this is a pretty big secret so I have confidence in him.
<user0> Fingers crossed for you!  I'm sure it will be fine.  Are you nervous?
<user0> Being a business owner is hard. I'm sure she is grateful for your help.
<user1> RIght? Even if I can't directly affect her business, I can help keep her spirits up to weather the storm!
<user0> Yes, mental and emotional support is the best kind of support.
<user0> What kind of car is it? 
<user1> Subaru Brat, best car ever made. Its like a car and a t ruck all in one. 
<user0> ooh nice! just start to SAVE, SAVE,SAVE where ever you can and you will get there.
<user1> I know, it would look perfect in front of my double wide mobile home! There is a used one on the corner for $350. But that will take me months to save up. 
<user0> Time goes by so fast. You'll see. 
<user1> Yeah, or I could buy more scratch offs at the gas station and hit it big. 
<user0> LOL, well there is always luck!
<user0> I remember those potty training days!!!    I bet you were so embarrassed.
<user1> It was not one of our best moments. Luckily, she was wearing and long dress and I had extra diapers so we could remedy the situation.
<user0> THank goodness you had extra supplies on hand.   My son was the hardest one out of my 3 kids to potty train.   I feel your pain!!
<user0> Oh, did you give it to him yet?
<user1> No, not yet. But, I can't wait to! He's going to have so much fun with it.
<user0> That's so cool. I'm sure he will love it! Where did you get it?
<user0> I love vacations I hope you and him have a good time.
<user1> I hope so too. I have wanted to go on a cruise for so long. I'm happy were are able to go this year.
<user0> What cruise line are you using did they give you a good discount.
<user1> We are going with a few friends, so they booked it and we got a discount because they are returning customers.
<user1> Oh my goodness! What happened?
<user0> He had fallen and bruised his ribs. I had to take him to the hospital.
<user1> Is he okay now?
<user1> Oh, I know what you mean. I have felt that way. Best thing to do is pray about it and don't be hard on yourself.
<user0> Yes, I prayed about it multiple times, and by the last night, I was able to feel the Spirit move and I was able to praise and worship too. It felt amazing and it carried over into both services on Sunday too.
<user1> That's amazing! I'm so happy your prayers were answered. God knows your heart.
<user0> Thank you. He is all knowing and I'm just so thankful that he cares about me.
<user0> I've never done that but i know plenty of people who do that. Its normal every know and again but don't turn it into a daily habit!
<user1> Yeah but I feel bad afterwards. I like to make peanut butter and nutella sandwiches with chocolate chip cookies.
<user0> Damn that sounds good, honestly its fine every know and again. we all have a sweet tooth.
<user0> Aw, yay!  How old is he?
<user1> He's 6. It was so much fun to watch him open his presents.
<user0> I love that age!  My niece just turned six and she seems so grown up!
<user0> Oh thats awesome, im sure you were excited to help
<user1> I was very excite to help. I miss playing very much, so being able to play with my daughters and show of my skills a little was great.
<user0> thats great, sounds like a fun time. And you got to share time with your daughters which is awesome.
<user0> Oh that sucks, have you experienced the symptoms?
<user1> Yeah, I was blind in my right eye, and my left arm was numb.
<user0> Oh damn thats terrible, I hope it didn't affect your life too much.
<user0> That sucks, hopefully its just something minor. You're a good person for taking care of her
<user1> Yes.  She has been vomiting and having diarhea a lot
<user0> Oh, that sounds bad, probably a stomach virus. those suck!
<user1> Yes.  It has just happened on and off for months.
<user1> Thats great, perfect time to unwind and relax, and earn money!
<user0> Yes.  My cat is relaxing and always sleeping
<user1> Awesome, sometimes they can get annoying always running around and nagging you.
<user1> How did it go?
<user0> I am not sure yet.  I was very nervous
<user1> I'd have been nervous too.  When will you find out?
<user0> Next week I think
<user0> Oh, I would love time away like that! How did you enjoy it?
<user1> It was fantastic.  I found it so restful and peaceful just to get away from it all for a while.
<user0> That sounds wonderful! My body is craving something like this. Thanks for the inspiration!
<user0> Oh no, did they do something embarrasing?
<user1> Heh, well they projectile vomited all over my carpet, it was gross. 
<user0> That's absolutely disgusting!
<user0> Did the two of you have fun?
<user1> Yeah we did. She can ride up and down the ramps much better than I expected her to.
<user0> That's awesome. My son has a skateboard but can barely stand up on it.
<user0> I am sorry that you are out of work.  Have you had any job interviews? It is good that your father is able to help you during this time.
<user1> No, I am filing for disability. Theres no way I can ever repay him
<user0> Well, I am glad you will hopefully get some disability income.  It sounds like your dad isn't the type who expects to be repayed.  He sounds like a great parent.
<user0> Did everything work out ok? How did you like them?
<user1> They seem ok. I just hate having to meet new doctors.
<user0> Oh, me too. I don't even like to sit in the waiting room.
<user0> Interesting, are you feeling OK having less bonding time?
<user1> Yeah, it's just too quiet lol.
<user0> I see, I imagine time will start to fly once you take up a new hobby, or school ends for the day.
<user0> That's not very fun. I hate traveling like that.
<user1> Same. I wish I had just stayed at home instead of spending all that time on the road.
<user0> At least you got to see your family for a little bit.
<user1> That is true, I guess there is that to be thankful for.
<user1> Ew, that's always the worst. What were you getting?
<user0> Just some random food stuffs. It wouldn't have been so bad but there was only one cashier.
<user1> That's always the case! So annoying. I love the self checkout options. I wish more places had that.
<user1> Oh no! I am sorry to hear of your loss. Are you taking it ok?
<user0> I'm ok. It just hit me hard seeing all those sad people.
<user1> Yeah, funerals are really sad but they can make one appreciate life so much more.
<user1> Wow i'd be jealous
<user0> I am!  I would love to go myself.
<user1> Same. I have a chance in a few years to go with the family but not 100%.
<user1> I bet it is! I love getting together with friends, especially if it has been a while...which it seems to be the older I get.
<user0> Same. And all these guys live in different places now so it's harder and harder to get everyone together.
<user1> I bet it would be tough.  Was there a special occasion that brought you all together?
<user0> No. We've had a group text going for several years so we just all decided it had been too long.
<user1> Thats so awesome! I hope you all had a ton of fun!
<user1> Hahaha, yes we women don't want to get the men angry. But clothes are so expensive these days. We just want to look good for our men.
<user0> I know I know. I just wish she could tell me up front. I get more irritated finding out she lied about it.
<user1>  I guess you can just tell her like you told me just now. Maybe she won't be afraid to tell you next time....... well maybe, lol.
<user0> Oh, I've tried...
<user0> Yikes, that doesnt happen too often in today's culture.  Did you say anything?
<user1> No kidding! I don't see how those kind of people are still around. No. It had already escalated by the time I saw it. We figured it was best to just keep moving.
<user0> That might be for the best.  Were they arguing about her color or something else?
<user1> No. She just thought the other woman wasnt doing her job. Classic sense of entitlement.
<user0> Thats really annoying. It would be great if people would just let other people be.
<user0> I'm sorry you don't get to see her much. I don't see mine often either. I'm sure it did make you sad.
<user1> We just dont live super close so it always makes it harder.
<user0> Yeah, I understand that. I live about 45 minutes from mine and everyone is so busy all the time. Maybe you will be able to see her soon.
<user0> Great! Are you home all day or do you just get them off to school and then head to work yourself?
<user1> I'm home with my toddler, so I drop them off and pick them up. The school is exactly 7 minutes away. I'm glad my shopping in advance paid off.
<user0> For sure! I bet it was nice to have the hosue a little more quiet too.
<user0> Oh that must have been torture! Is everything alright?
<user1> Yes fortunately everything turned out ok. But it was nerve wracking waiting on the answer.
<user0> I can imagine. Glad you are ok though! :)
<user0> Oh no! that's no bueno. Usually the person that wants the least deserves the most. Thats sad
<user1> It really is. The worst part is that they had arguments in front of him, while he was sick, about who should get what. I wish they would have spent that time just loving and comforting him. That's what my husband and I tried to do.
<user0> Oh that's awful and borderline abusive
<user1> Yes, the whole situation made me mad then and mad now. There is nothing I can do though except pray about it.
<user1> ah, you must have great memories than
<user0> The memories are awesome and I miss playing.But I wouldn't trade the life I live now to go back,
<user1> you know today's events are tomorrow's memories
<user1> Cool! What kind of fish do you expect to catch there?
<user0> Blue catfish, they get so huge. I have a secret recipe for stink bait that works well!
<user1> Yum! Invite me over for some fish dinner sometime, won't you?
<user0> Oh I will, fried catfish is so amazing. Especially beer battered!
<user0> That sounds like fun!  Is it with friends?
<user1> Well with some locals at the local brewpub
<user0> So cool, I hope it goes well
<user1> Yes I think I will do well even though I just learned last week how to play!
<user1> That is 
<user0> I have to make sure the house is clean and that everything is in order before they arrive, nerve wracking!
<user1> That is so nice when family visits. It is so much fun! But yeah, it is a lot of work for sure. 
<user1> Oh, Happy early Birthday! What is it that you are hoping for?
<user0> Thank you, I am hoping for a new camera. It is about time to upgrade. 
<user1> Nice! I hope you get it! Cameras are such a wonderful tool to have these days and there are so many cool options to choose from.
<user0> Thanks, I really enjoy getting out and photographing nature. 
<user0> oh jeez! what a mess.
<user1> I know, it is going to take me all evening to clean up!
<user0> I like dogs but thats why i dont have one lol
<user1> He is usually good, but this time his naughtiness got to him. 
<user1> Excellent! Stay hydrated!
<user0> Oh I will, I am ready for whatever the elements throw at me!
<user1> Sounds like fun!
<user0> It will be a blast, I just love roughing it in the outdoors!
<user0> Wow, that sounds quite disturbing. Was someone breaking in?
<user1> No, it turns out the power had went out for a minute and it was the sound of the printer calibrating. 
<user0> I'm glad everything turned out okay!
<user0> Yeah flooding is a real problems these days. The weather is crazy! Hopefully you and your house will stay nice and dry.
<user1> I know, it really starts too pool up by our house. It is getting kind of scary!
<user0> I would be scared too. I hope everything will be ok for you. Fingers crossed.
<user1> Yeah, really don't want to deal with a flooded home! Would not be good for my family. 
<user1> you sort of gamble on store bought cakes, did you take it back?
<user0> No, I ended up just suffering through it and eating it. 
<user1> you are a lot bravery than I, I do't think i could it eat
<user0> Yeah, I am afraid to return things. The clerks kind of scare me. 
<user0> Do you feel any less nervous?  Job interviews are always nerve-wracking 
<user1> Yea, it made me feel better about myself and my chances, or maybe i just like spending money
<user0> Either way, as long as you feel a little bit better it was worth it.  I'm sure you'll do great!
<user0> Oh yeah! I love chocolate anything! But grandmas cooking is always the best of all!
<user1> Nothing beats cookies made by grandma. Except for the oatmeal ones. Too healthy haha. 
<user0> Not me! haha I love them all!
<user1> Only if it has raisins to sweeten them up!
<user1> that must be a cute picture
<user0> It is!  In it, she's just standing with a huge smile on her face and a Hello Kitty backpack.
<user1> so young and ready to conquer the world
<user1> What video games are the two of you playing?
<user0> Minecraft and asphalt racing are two of them, It's amazing to watch a child learn and grow their intelligence. 
<user1> It's always amazing how quickly kids pick up on new skills.
<user1> You must really love that dip to have that much of a reaction to the loss of it.
<user0> I do!  I've loved that particular brand for years - to me it's the best out there.  But I guess there's quite a few people out there besides me that have a real love for it!
<user1> I would assume so, since there has to be someone out there who robbed you of your oniony gold!
<user0> Oniony gold!  That's a very apt description!
<user0> Congrats! is it a good promotion?
<user1> It is!  I'll actually be the manager of the entire office, and not just the one section I was in!
<user0> Wow that is super exciting. Not many people get that opportunity. You must have worked hard 
<user1> I try to.  But I'm glad all the effort is being recognized!
<user1> Wow, that's really exciting! Good for you, you must be nervous. 
<user0> On the one hand, I am but on the other hand I have to relax knowing I did everything I could do and worked as hard as I could.  It's kinda out of my hands now.
<user1> That's great, what kind of work are you in?
<user0> I work for a medical supply company.
<user1> Well I really hope you get it. You're right, you did what you could. 
<user1> That's horrible news!  I don't understand how people can be so cruel sometimes.
<user0> I have a hard enough time understanding man's inhumanity towards their fellow man, but towards animals who can't do much to defend themselves?  I hope they put those people *under* the jail!
<user1> I know in some places, the penalty for hurting an animal can be tougher than that for hurting your kids.  Nothing makes sense sometimes. 
<user0> Where I live, they're only now starting to toughen up the animal cruelty laws.  Even so, they lag far behind a lot of other states.
<user0> Was that a good day for you?
<user1> So good, genuinely had my faith restored in the national team and everyone was having a good time larking about in good weather!
<user0> That's amazing! Sounds like a beauty day! Are you English?
<user0> Oh, but I bet you appreciated it! Summer can get long. 
<user1> It can.  But we had fun!  Visited lots of relatives, cooked lots of stuff, goofed off and watched more anime than is probably humanly possible...a part of me is enjoying the quiet but on the other hand, I miss having my kids around to do stuff with.
<user0> Oh, that does sound like a fun summer. I read recently that we only get 18 summers with our kids- make them count. 
<user1> Yep - and I have two left with the older one.  They do grow up so fast!
<user0> It's good to stop and appreciate teh moment sometimes. 
<user0> Oh no, I can imagine so! Was it gunky?
<user1> Yes indeed, there was even a frog under there! So bizarre! 
<user0> Oh goodness, glad you got through is safe lol
<user0> Oh, that's not right. I have a rescue dog, she had a litter of puppies at a puppy mill before she was a year. 
<user1> Wow!  It makes me sad how people can be so cruel to animals that don't have the ability to fight back.  The rescue shelters here have been working overtime to get things straightened out at that farm.
<user0> I could chat with you all day! We have a lot in common- I feel the same way. Keep chatting? Poor rescue animals. 
<user1> Yeah.  But I'm glad at least here we have enough agencies [and people volunteering their time] that hopefully, those animals can find good care and good homes.
<user0> That's great! So sad for those poor animals. 
<user1> And in my opinion, the bond for those people was nowhere near high enough - they should have had to stay in jail!
<user0> They should- they say people who hurt animals will hurt people too. 
<user0> That sounds awesome, I'm glad he did well. 
<user1> I am, too!  I'm glad he's doing something he loves.  At this point, I'm just waiting on the text to see which team he made it onto.
<user0> I hope he gets the team he wants. 
<user0> You must be relieved! You excited for free time?
<user1> Yes!  I can go back to having ice cream for breakfast!  I can watch Law and Order all I want to without the, "Mom, you always watch this!" comment!
<user0> That sounds seriously like a dream. I cannot wait until mine are old enough to start school.
<user1> How old are they?
<user0> 4 and 1. I have a bit to go haha.
<user1> Enjoy them now!  Mine are 17, 15, and 10 and too cool for *everything*.  LOL
<user1> Awww that will be a boring week. Sorry to hear that. Maybe you'll be productive!
<user0> On the one hand, I hope so but on the other hand, I'll get bored because there's nothing to break up the day.  Just straight...ugh!  XD
<user1> I hope it flies by! 
<user1> Was the owner not around? Did the dog cause any harm?
<user0> He was growling at me and looked like he wanted to bite me, the neighbor finally came out and called him home. was intense. 
<user1> Sounds scary! Dogs are very loyal creatures but can cause a lot of harm
<user1> That is very heartbreaking. How did you find the kitten?
<user0> She was under my house, crying.  Her mother had apparently abandoned her.  I called my friend who said she was dehydrated and we did what we could, but her motor functions quit and she passed away in her sleep.
<user1> Very sad to hear. You have a good heart and are very caring, that is something to atleast be proud of!
<user0> And that kitten knew she was loved.  It ended sad, but I take comfort in those things.
<user0> Kids pick those things up quickly.  And it'll help with her hand-eye coordination, reading - all sorts of things!  
<user1> Yea, i was pretty proud of her, especially since things are more complicated now than when i was a kid. 
<user0> Yeah.  Back when the only buttons on a controller were Start, Select, A and B!
<user0> Oh no! Hopefully you are able to get it sorted out. It's hard to keep up with all the fees for kids schooling.
<user1> I keep all my receipts - I learned that lesson her 9th grade year.  I just hate having to make the trip over to the high school because it's in the opposite direction of where I do everything else!
<user0> Sounds like a headache, i know the feeling. I got a letter saying i had a few days to purchase a purple shirt from my daughters school. Good luck!
<user0> That would be rough.  Hopefully youre in a better spot now!  Thats awesome you had family to help you out too!
<user1> Yea i'm much better now, thanks to my mom. Attorneys make a killing on these types of things.
<user0> I bet they do! I mean they do go to school for a while and study hard, plus the schools arent cheap but they still dont have to charge as much as they do!
<user0> i would love some quiet time to myself, consider yourself lucky!
<user1> hah, i hear ya. I just got so used to all the commotion i suppose. 
<user0> i have a husband and three kids, its always loud in my house
<user0> Oh no! How did you guys get caught?
<user1> My mom noticed the charge and found a the missing check from her checkbook, i'll never forget the look of dissapointment on her face!
<user0> I bet, did you both get in a lot of trouble?
<user1> Oh yea. grounded for a long time. 
<user1> What movie was it?  Is it currently in theaters?
<user0> It was the new Jurassic World
<user1> Thats too bad! I was hoping that one was going to be good!
<user1> Oh my gosh! I would be furious as well. 
<user0> He's such a worm. I can't stand it.
<user1> I am sorry that happened. Don't do him any favors.
<user1> Yeah, you need peace and quiet to be able to work.
<user0> I love my kid but she is non stop with trying to show me the latest my little pony video, gonna pull my hair out.
<user1> My son keeps trying to show me Youtube videos so I completely understand
<user1> That is normal that just means that the other person is special 
<user0> Yeah, I really think she might be the one. I hope I don't screw it up. 
<user1> Well i will keep my finger crossed for you!
<user0> Thank you, I am looking forward to taking her to a nice place to eat!
<user0> Yeah i can imagine but a little worm wont hurt ya
<user1> Yeah, but not what I want to bite into when I am trying to enjoy my apple. 
<user0> I understand but atleast it was not poisonous 
<user1> That is true, I should be thankful for that. 
<user1> I live in bear country.
<user0> They really startled me, the female did not seem happy to see me.
<user1> I bet I would have been scared
<user0> Yeah, thankfully I was able to get away. It took a while for me to catch my breath. 
<user0> Awwww. that is so sweet! Details. Boy, girl, breed. 
<user1> He is a male australian shepherd. His name is charlie, he is super cute!
<user0> Awwwww. He sounds super cute! Have lots of fun with him. 
<user1> Will do! He is super cuddly and loves to follow me around!
<user1> oopsy. I hope it was worth it. 
<user0> It might not be when my wife returns and sees it gone. I look super guilty right now.
<user1> LOL! Can  you run out and get another pie before she gets home?
<user0> I could, I might have to buy her some of her favorite chocolate. 
<user0> That sounds terrifying, so glad you did not step on it
<user1> Me too, that would of wrecked my day. It was so close! It haunts my thoughts even now. 
<user0> I can imagine I would have nightmares about that 
<user1> It might take me a little while to get over my fear and go back to the park. 
<user0> And be watchful when you do!
<user1> For sure, wouldn't want to relive that experience
<user1> Congratulations. Thats always a plus.
<user0> It was a really nice bonus too, they were impressed with the quality of work I have done this year.
<user1> Good for you!
<user0> Now I will have to work even harder and try to earn a larger one next year.
<user0> If the movie is worth it you will never miss them.
<user1> I hope so, but I am really missing them right now. I didn't want to go alone. 
<user0> I understand. Its tough these days.
<user1> It is hard to find reliable friends. No one seems to show up anymore. 
<user1> I love butterflies because of the colors. What color was the butterfly?
<user0> The butterfly was yellow. It was a tiger swallowtail. One of my favorites!
<user1> Yellow butterflies are beautiful. Photography can capture some great images a lot of times.
<user1> Oh, my dog did that, too! I don't know how they think it's a tasty morsel...so gross!!
<user0> Yeah, it's nasty. I wouldn't let her lick my face for a while after that.
<user1> I was just going to say the same thing! I'm like "Stay away!" 
<user1> I love cats.
<user0> I usually love mine, but not when it is keeping me from sleeping
<user1> I agree absolutely
<user1> Congratulations. I hope you get it?
<user0> Me too. I'm feeling pretty nervous about it
<user1> Just relax. If its meant to be it will be.
<user1> That must have been scary..
<user0> Yes it was. I was so afraid we'd crash
<user1> I bet
<user1> How long did he think he had won?
<user0> Only a few minutes.
<user1> That was funny I bet.
<user1> Oh wow, did you give him the money?
<user0> I didn't have any. He came into the house and stole some stuff
<user1> That would be so scary, I am glad you are safe!
<user1> I'm so sorry to hear that. How long had your cat been with you?
<user0> I had him for 17 years, he lived a full and happy life, but I was not ready for him to go.
<user1> It's always hard to go through that. That's why I'm wary of having any pets
<user0> But they make your life so much enjoyable while they are around!
<user0> Does he like to sing?
<user1> He's kind of shy about it. He had to get really drunk to perform karaoke
<user0> I bet he sings in the shower everyday.
<user0> You must have worked hard for that! I'm sure it's great and you'll pass with a flying color!
<user1> I worked many long hours. It was stressful but I'm happy to have done well
<user0> Yeah, such a relief to get a huge project done. You must feel proud!
<user0> That must be really irritating. Is she doing it deliberately?
<user1> She does it more because she likes it than to bug me. It's going to be stuck in my head for weeks
<user0> Haha - maybe you'll learn to love it! There must be something good about it, if your sister has any taste.
<user0> I've never been abroad before, but I'm going to spend two weeks in France next month!
<user1> That is great! What will you be doing there? 
<user0> I am going to visit a few cities and tourist attractions.
<user0> Oh no, did they get angry? 
<user1> No, I think she was just a little shocked by it. I felt so bad.
<user0> Okay, I am glad that they were not angry. and I am sure they knew it was unintentional so don't feel too guilty about it. :) 
<user0> Wow you are very trusting, I do not think I would allow a friend to borrow my car. Is it legal for him to drive with just a permit? 
<user1> I was in the car with him. He just wanted to practice driving and he didn't have his own car.
<user0> Oh okay I see, I thought you actually lent him your car and let him drive around town with it by himself! 
<user0> That's a big decision! What are your choices?
<user1> I was thinking about graphic design. Or, I was going to do something practical like Nursing.
<user0> If you want my advice - choose something you're going to enjoy. I personally couldn't be a nurse - too messy!
<user1> I guess you are right. I really like sketching and painting. I can use my creativity side.
<user1> I hoep you reach your goal. It must be tiring.
<user0> Well at first I was a little discouraged because I wasn't making that much. Things have picked up recently though, and I feel I will be able to help him a good bit so I'm feeling better about it.
<user1> Don't give up. Things may not be great one day but they always pick up eventually.
<user1> that stinks were you guys going school clothes shopping?
<user0> Yes. We were able to go about a week later, but the closer it got to school starting back I started to stress. Everything is good now though. 
<user1> That's good, school shopping is always stressful for me
<user1> okey no problem
<user0> I don't want to have problems. This is why I check in with him.
<user1> For mine too. That was also i said.
<user1> I understand completely. One has to live within one's budget. It can be hard though.
<user0> I like go out but I have to really make sure that I don't spend too much. I sometimes like to leave a tip if possible.
<user1> It's only normal to want to live within one's means. Too bad you can't leave a tip every time.
<user1> Wow ! Thats quite unfortunate!
<user0> Yes, it is. They are all being really selfish and childish. My husband is staying out of it, but I can tell that he is getting fed up with it.
<user1> Well handle it wisely
<user1> It sounds like a stressful day. You have to just live in the present so, you will not be too stress out.
<user0> Yeah, I'm ready to get everything done so I can relax. I can't start on the errands until I drop the kids at school though.
<user1> When that is over then you can do you. We have to make time for ourselves.
<user1> I'm very sorry for your loss. Thinking about and remember all of your good memories with her may help.
<user0> It is a blessing and curse. When I am having problems I think about what she would say to me.
<user1> That's a good way to remember her and keep her close to your heart.
<user0> Yes, it is. I know that time heals.
<user1> Yes, it does. 
<user1> That can't be easy. How old are your children? Sometimes I wish we could keep our kids small forever!
<user0> I have 23, 20, 17 and 14. They are doing stuff that I question but I don't want them to not tell me stuff.
<user1> Yeah you want them to learn, but it's definitely hard to see them doing things that you might not agree with. 
<user1> Wow that's really scary! Labor is a really terrifying thing, especially when something like that happens. Did everything turn out okay?
<user0> Yes, everything turned out fine. She is a healthy and happy three year old. It was the scariest day of my life though.
<user1> I can imagine. When I was in the hospital with my 3 year old they lost all his vitals as well. Kids like to keep us on our toes from the start!
<user0> Yes, they do. I ope your boy is all good now.
<user0> What platform do you play it on? PC or PS4?
<user1> PC all the way. I've been grinding devotion points all week.
<user0> PC is the way to go for gaming. That sounds like an awesome type of game. Is it multiplayer?
<user0> That's so cute. How old is she?
<user1> It's not cute, and she's nine. By old flowers I mean, it's a green, stagnant slush with mold growing on top.
<user0> Oh mine. That is not cute.
<user0> That's no good. Did you go to the doctor?
<user1> Yes I did. It was so hot outside and I did not have much to drink.
<user0> Got to make sure you take care of your self. It's scary when your heat sensitive.
<user0> It will be okay. We sometimes do things that we regret.
<user1> I fell down, and apparently said some embarrassing things. 
<user0> You have to forgive ourselves. We don't need others validation.
<user0> Will you be able to spend more time with her?
<user1> Yes, I will. She has been under a lot of stress.
<user0> I can imagine, but it's good that her hard work is about to pay off.
<user0> What'd MS?
<user1> Its a disease that attacks the nervous system. It was really scary to find out I had it. I just went blind in my right eye one day. Two days and several test later I found out I had MS.
<user0> Well ,I pray you get through it
<user0> How do you feel about that ?
<user1> I feel really sad because I felt she should have told me.
<user0> Hopefully she re considers you should talk to her about it
<user0> That is risky, what do you plan to do
<user1> Well, nothing. I'm sure that she will be a responsible driver.
<user0> Okey if she is no cause for alarm
<user0> Good. You sound confident. When is it?
<user1> It is tonight. I studied really hard.
<user0> I'm sure you'll do great then!
<user0> Oh how sweet, high school days is always fun
<user1> Yes, it had me feeling nostalgic about the times when I was young. 
<user0> Yes it does happen
<user0> am sorry to hear that, may he rest in peace
<user1> Thank you. I was crushed, and it left me with questions about my own mortality.
<user0> I hope you getting better now
<user0> Oh no! I'm sorry. Is she going to be ok?
<user1> Yes, but bhe bruised her wrist, and had a concussion. I wish that I was there for her when it happened.
<user0> Oh man. Don't feel guilty accidents happen. Hopefully she recovers quickly.
<user0> Thats great what is your favorite meal?
<user1> It was a skirt steak with avocados. I was very satisfied.
<user0> That sounds so good i love steaks
<user0> It can been nerve-wracking to start a new job. But I'm sure you did well, right?
<user1> I did, but I find it hard to trust people. Especially at work.
<user0> It's wise to be careful but suspecting people all the time may not be healthy. You need to build a good relationship with your new co-workers.
<user0> I know exactly how you feel. I have a crazy addiction to soda.  I don't think I can quit!
<user1> It just makes me feel bad, that no matter how many times I try, I still give in to the temptation.
<user0> Maybe try to slowly quit? Like just drink one less a day
<user1> Yeah, I think that's what I will have to do. Thanks for the advice.
<user1> When will you find out?
<user0> I still need wait another week.
<user1> Oh the wait is terrible.  What type of job?
<user0> A drafter.
<user0> Oh no! That is not good! Hopefully you were able to get them out. 
<user1> Yeah, all the toys are out. But, they got some explaining to do after school.
<user0> LOL! I'm sure. Don't be too rough on them.
<user0> Why couldn't you sleep?
<user1> Combination of stress and new meds I think. Maybe I can get back to my old scheduled soon.
<user0> I hope so! Why are you stressed?
<user0> Oh, that sounds uncomfortable. How did you play it?
<user1> I was a little upset, but it wasn't my business. I let it go.
<user0> I respect that, I think it shows character and honor. I'm hoping something rewarding comes your way.
<user0> Oh geez, thats not good.  Was he bothering anyone?
<user1> No, but he seemed a little unpredictable, so I used the other door.
<user0> I dont blame you.  I probably would have done the same thing.
<user0> I remember that feeling with my daughter, it is indescribable.
<user1> Yes!! I can't think of any thing else that produces feelings like that.
<user0> There is nothing to compare it to. I wish I hadn't been waking from anesthesia in that moment so I could have been more awake. 
<user0> Oh no! It happens to the best of us :) Have you talked to her about it when you remembered?
<user1> Absolutely! I called her the next day and made sure to visit her. :)
<user0> Awww I'm sure she completely understood and really appreciated you reaching out and going to visit her!
<user1> She did. :) It ended up being a good visit anyway!
<user1> Oh, how cool! Dd you and your dad play together?
<user0> No, just me. But, I am going to go play this weekend at a place up the road. It's been years since I've played.
<user1> That's great. It'll be wonderful to relive those happy moments in the present maybe with your family.
<user1> Wow, that is scary. Were you nervous?
<user0> Absolutely! I've always been scared of heights, but I'm so glad I made myself.
<user1> It sounds like a great experience!
<user1> How did you feel when he gave it away? 
<user0> I was very upset. I was only like nine at the time so I took it really hard.
<user1> Yeah I would have been too. As a nine year old kid that's hard to deal with. 
<user1> Ouch! Was it a serious fall?
<user0> No, only my pride was injured.
<user1> That's a relatively quick recovery, fortunately. 
<user1> Oh my.. that must have been very sad. I can't even imagine how you must have felt. 
<user0> Yeah, she passed more than five years ago and I had forgotten all about it. It brought back so many memories though!
<user1> I'm so sorry.! But I'm really glad you've got those pleasant memories and the memento to hold on to so you can remember her fondly. 
<user1> Wow that's great, you must have put a lot of work into your yard.
<user0> I did, mowed it three times a week and watered it twice a day. All the hard work really paid off. 
<user1> Cool, I guess the grass is actually greener in your yard now!
<user0> It is, it really stands out from all the brown grass in my neighbors yards.
<user0> Ooh nice. That does sound like alot of fun. Do you guys play any sport while your there? 
<user1> We often throw around a frisbee for a little bit, but we never get too intense with any sports. 
<user0> Cool. Well enjoy, I hope the weather hold up.
<user1> Me too, there has been a lot of rain lately. It should be fun hanging out with old friends!
<user0> Yeah, I haven't seen my friends in forever. We don't even live in the same state anymore.
<user0> I understand that feeling. I've had trouble letting go of those kind of cravings too. Has your diet been going well otherwise?
<user1> Otherwise it's been pretty good- I've managed to lose 12 pounds! Just wish I could let the sugar cravings go.
<user0> Wow, congratulations! Sugar is one of the hardest things to kick, I don't have the knack for it either, but still you're making great progress!
<user0> Oh no!  It always seems like things get lost when you move doesn't it?  Is there anyway you can go back and see if its at your old place?
<user1> I've actually checked and went through all the boxes too. Here's hoping it turns up one day though!
<user0> It will probably be where you least expect it!
<user0> Oh wow.  How did she do?
<user1> She did great. She's pretty good about looking out for cars.
<user0> That's awesome!  That's great exercise! 
<user0> Oh, no! That's so terrible!
<user1> It was. They wanted to blame my daughter but it was their fault.
<user0> I'm so sorry that happened! I'm glad she's okay, though.
<user0> That is a great sister. I'm sorry you were feeling down
<user1> Yeah it was really sweet of her and made me feel so much better!
<user0> I am glad you are feeling better now
<user0> That must've been scary! Did you freak out?
<user1> I didn't, but I was really nervous for a little while. My wife didn't handle it quite as well.
<user0> Oh no. I'm sorry to hear that. At least you both survived the flight. 
<user1> For sure. And it was a great trip.
<user1> Oh I bet you were pretty upset. Did you guys reschedule?
<user0> We did and I made sure to not screw that one up!
<user1> Haha good! I'm glad that one went well.
<user0> Me too. Who knows what would have happened to me if I did it twice.
<user0> It's always nice to visit home. Did your parents enjoy your visit?
<user1> They loved having me around again! Our ten year old dog wouldn't leave my side.
<user0> Ha ha! I bet. Dogs are the best. I bet he missed you just as much as they did.
<user0> What makes you want to get softer wheels? Are those harder to skateboard on?
<user1> No, they make rough pavement feel smoother. I think I'll just keep the ones I have for now though. Just have to deal with having a rough ride.
<user0> I didn't know that about softer wheels! Maybe in the future you can change to those.
<user0> Oh neat!  How did the little one handle it?
<user1> It did not go well at all! She pooped all over the carpet and she never has accidents at home.
<user0> Oh no!  Poor baby must have been really stressed out. 
<user1> Yeah, I think it might've been too much on her at once. I was pretty embarrassed.
<user1> Oh no!  Hopefully its just the flu.  What did they say?
<user0> It was just the flu. I got her some medicine, brought her home, and made tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwiches.
<user1> That's good!  I hope she gets to feeling better soon.  The flu is no fun.
<user1> Congratulations! I bet she is excited and hopefully you are excited for her. 
<user0> Absolutely! The whole family is flying out, we can barely contain ourselves.
<user1> Oooo!!! That is so awesome! Will you be in her wedding party?
<user1> I love kitten, but I can't have one where I live. I bet it is so cute
<user0> Oh, she is absolutely adorable! I'm so envious, I haven't been able to adopt one yet.
<user1> Do you plan on getting one
<user1> oh man. i hate that. we've had some pretty nasty storms come through Austin in the last few months and luckily i've managed to be in some random parking garage out shopping or eating when they've rolled through.
<user0> Nice! We have a garage, but my wife takes up what little room isnt filled with junk with her car. Mine wouldnt fit anyway unless I cleared it out.
<user1> lol. well that's no good. cleaning garages bites. 
<user1> i guess in your field of work you would run across terms and methods which are unfamiliar
<user0> That is true. I usually can keep up, but this guy is on another level. 
<user1> you'll find some like that, not much you can do
<user1> How long did it take you to get your promotion?
<user0> I've been working there for a couple years now. I'm feeling pretty good about my chances! Haven't heard back yet.
<user1> I bet that your bosses will give you the long over promotion. I will keep my fingers crossed for you. Good luck!
<user1> That's wonderful! Do you have a charity in mind yet?
<user0> Yes, it is my local animal shelter. They will be there to cheer me on! 
<user1> I bet it will feel amazing to have them cheering you on! I have a feeling you'll do great in your race.
<user1> That's wonderful! Where are you guys going to go?
<user0> It was just a trip to the west coast. There was a handful of things she's always wanted to see/do. So we did all of them.
<user1> I'm glad you guys had a good time. Are you planning another trip?
<user0> Not yet. We try to take one big trip a year if possible. We just got back from that one, so we will start plotting out next year a little later I would imagine.
<user0> Where is it that you go to go home? 
<user1> I grew up in Alabama. It is not far from Florida but still I get so thrill when I can go back to see family and friends.
<user0> That's awesome. I love going back to my hometown to visit as well. It's nice to see family you don't see every day.
<user0> wow. like, very first? or just the start of the year?
<user1> Very first. I was so nervous till he got off the bus.
<user0> how did he like it? how did you do?
<user0> Oh boy!!   WHat is the test over?    
<user1> It's a Japanese language test for college. I feel pretty good about it though, been going over and over it every night.
<user0> Japanese language seems like it would be heard to learn.  Good luck on your test, Im sure you will do fine.
<user0> great, i hope you get the job.
<user1> Thank you. I wrote down a list of questions and key points beforehand.
<user0> so you were really prepared. 
<user0> That's cool, good movies have a way of tapping into those feelings.
<user1> Yes. It's almost like a time machine. Fond memories.
<user0> Sometimes it almost makes me want to go back somehow. But it's also important to move forward.
<user0> oh that is so wrong. How are you handling it?
<user1> Not very well. It makes me so angry. So I go work out to relieve the stress.
<user0> that's good you do that, I would be very frustrated too. That's really unfair. Can you pursue legal charges?
<user0> Oh I bet that was fun. What kind of dog do you have?
<user1> I missed her while she was gone. We have a mixed breed rescue pup.
<user0> My husband was gone all weekend buying us a new puppy, so I understand feeling lonely! 
<user0> Ugh, I bet that is really frustrating. Is it making it difficult to do your job?
<user1> Sometimes. It doesn't stop me from doing things, just slows me down and takes longer than it should to do the things I need to do.
<user0> That makes for long days at work. I hope they can fix it for you soon.
<user1> Me too!
<user1> Omg, I bet they come home so spoiled.
<user0> Yeah they do! Some times I wish I got to go visit grandma's like they do lol.
<user1> Yeah, what the heck I don't remember my mom being so nice when I was a kid! lol
<user1> That's sad to hear. What's his prognosis?
<user0> He's doing about as well as he can be. Very healthy, but without some new discoveries he will likely have a shortened lifespan.
<user1> Hopefully medical technology will catch up to where it needs to be for him. 
<user1> Oh no! I used to be a financial advisor so I'm sure that was frustrating. I hope you didn't lose too much money!
<user0> Not too much. I only put in what I could afford to lose.
<user1> As much as I hate they didn't go up in price for you, I'm so happy that you didn't overdo it.
<user1> Oh yuck! I'm sorry that that happened. What kind of dog is he? Is he sick?
<user0> Thanks. I dont think so. He has seemed fine otherwise. I've watched him on our security cam today and he seems fine. He is a mutt from a local shelter.
<user1> Hopefully it was just a bad day for him and he won't do it again! I have a couple rescue mutts as well. 
<user0> Yeah. I love that goofy animal.  Hope he's ok
<user0> That's great! Do you get a chance to learn new languages often?
<user1> Well I have the opportunity, but rarely have the time to really devote to it.
<user0> My ex programs for insurance companies and they all use the same, ancient language for their statistics. She hasn't had to learn anything new for decades.
<user1> Yeah i get that. I work for a startup so things change pretty rapidly around here.
<user1> holy moly thats great i cant ever walk normal
<user0> Yeah it took a lot of practice.
<user1> oh i bet
<user1> That is wonderful! So you will be on a vacation? Will you be going alone? 
<user0> No I am going with my wife and her family. But we all get along great so it should be fun.
<user1> You will be having fun in the sun. Nothing like a day at beach.
<user0> Amen. It is much needed. Ready for some sun and a drink with an umbrella.
<user1> Yea, once I vacationed on a Caribbean island, Lovely beaches, food and drinks.
<user1> Oh man! how long did it take to get your stuff back?
<user0> The whole vacation! I was so upset! I didn't have anything to wear for the duration.
<user1> Oh wow, that can sure put a damper on things.
<user1> oh wow thats fancy
<user0> Yeah i really did not see it coming at all.
<user1> i bet a shocker indeed i like apples
<user1> Nice! What did you guys get to eat?
<user0> We just went to a local taco place. It was a good conversation.
<user1> That's good that it was a profitable  conversation! Do you guys talk often?
<user0> It was more about just some personal life stuff. Not too much really.
<user0> Ooh, very nice suprize!
<user1> Absolutely. I certainly won't say no to that.
<user0> Keep up the good work, whatever your doing.
<user0> Oh dear. I am so sorry to hear. It is possible for you to get a second job?
<user1> I may have to if that happens. We are making it now, but if the car goes it will be pretty tough.
<user0> i can just imagine. I wish There was something that I could do to help.
<user1> It is ok. We are probably too proud to take help anyway. We will make it.
<user0> I pray and hope that something works out and that the good old faithful car will not bite the dust.
<user0> That is always a fun thing to do! I hope the memories were all good!
<user1> Absolutely! I remember having so much fun with them dressing them up. My sister and I would play for hours.
<user0> That's awesome! Did you show them to your sister after you found them?
<user0> Oh no! What happened to your laptop? if you get a new one which one are you looking at?
<user1> My daughter tripped on the cord and it smashed on the ground, not sure if it can be saved. I was pretty angry.
<user0> Ouch, What a pain that is! I can imagine, i would be the exact same in that situation.
<user0> Oh man that sucks. I'm so sorry because you could have slept in lol
<user1> I know, but the extra day of work was nice. Especially since I wasn't expecting it.
<user0> See there's always a bright side. You got a surprise day off from work!!!
<user1> It was wonderful. I ended up being twice as productive since I got up early.
<user0> That's awesome. Days off are the best!!
<user0> hey that's cool it's a new opportunity, what are you gonna do?
<user1> It's a job they opened up for graphic design! I'm super excited to get started and learn more from them.
<user0> hey that's really good I'm proud of you!!!!
<user0> That sounds like fun! My son does basketball. I bet he looks tough in his helmet and football gear. 
<user1> He thinks he does.  All I can think of is a bunch of Tiny Titans in helmets running around like chicks in a barnyard.  *chuckle*
<user0> Ha! They'
<user0> Thats awesome!  Have you been scheduled for an interview yet?
<user1> I was, I go in next Tuesday. I am pretty excited for them to give me the job.
<user0> I would be too!  I hope everything goes well with it!
<user1> Me too, we shall see. Now the waiting begins!
<user1> That's excellent! Is it a done deal yet?
<user0> No, but I have the necessary experience, and I'm optimistic that it will work out.
<user1> Cool! Good luck and think positive. 
<user1> Oh no. Poor baby must've been embarrassed. Did he cheer up?
<user0> He did, the clerk walked over, told him it was ok and gave him a treat.
<user1> That was really sweet of them. Glad he got a treat to cheer him up.
<user1> I've done one of those before. They are pretty cool. Do you think you will get the job?
<user0> I'm not sure. It was a little awkward and stressful.
<user1> I'm sorry to hear that. I'll pray for you if that's okay and  then maybe you will get it, but if not, maybe something even better will come along.
<user0> Sure, that's ok. And thank you.
<user1> Great. And you're very welcome. I enjoy praying for other people.
<user1> Sorry to hear that. There are no alternatives? 
<user0> Maybe, I haven't been back because I can't afford to go right now. I've just been dealing with the pain.
<user1> I can relate. I don't have healthcare at the moment.
<user0> It suck.Hopefully we can both get coverage soon.
<user0> Yay!! That is great news! He must be so happy he made it!
<user1> He is!  Especially since last year's team won the Opening Day Tournament and then won the Regular Season title!
<user0> Wow! What a great team to be on!
<user1> Yeah!  We had a group of really talented kids, and some very good [and patient] coahes!
<user1> That is amazing. She is a very smart girl.
<user0> Yes, I thought that was pretty good for a three year old. When I asked her about it she said they were playing school. Haha.
<user1> You must be proud of her. That is a lucky dog, a bark for each count. Haha.
<user0> I'm very proud of her.
<user1> Indeed you are I am proud of her as well.
<user1> Oh god I miss my dreamcast, I bet you were so happy when you got it.
<user0> Yep, i've never looked forward to something so much in my life. I still have the dreamcast as well. 
<user1> That's great I have pretty much all of the ones I had in my childhood, even the Atari.
<user1> Anything you need!! I'm here for you!
<user0> I'm 29 years old and I woke up to find that I'd wet the bed last night. I'm...not even sure how. I didn't drink a whole lot before bed or anything.
<user1> Don't sweat it, it happened to me in my mid 20's also. Couldn't even tell ya how or why, just that it did.
<user0> Should I see a therapist or anything? Is this indicative of some deep-seated problem that I'm not aware of?
<user1> LOL I don't think so. I think you'll be fine, maybe you were just extra tired.
<user1> Lol! I don't think i would trust that concoction if i were you.
<user0> Listen, my Uncle Jeb wouldn't do me dirty like that. You may call it """snake oil""" but I call it the miracle cure this world needs. After all, it worked.
<user1> Well then. Kudos to uncle Jeb!
<user1> I am so sorry to hear. I have a cat that I love very much. How is the cat doing now?
<user0> She's fine now! They found out it was something minor after x-rays. I was so relieved.
<user1> I am glad that she is much better.
<user1> that is very scary, how did you get home
<user0> My brother had to pick me up. He had to pull up behind me on the curb. It felt dangerous!
<user1> that is dangerous, glad that both of your are okay
<user1> Okay, well if you have it then you would have to see a doctor.
<user0> I saw one, and he said if I gave him $25,000 he would clear me for flight, but I don't have that kind of money just lying around. It's a real bummer. Now I just have to do super boring NASA desk work like tracking comets. Lame.
<user1> Now that is interesting, I wish you the best of luck.
<user1> Oh really? Are you afraid of missing out on something?
<user0> I don't know.  I just see stuff in the grocery store and think I like that food and buy it because it is on sale.  Even if I already have it!
<user1> Well it is good to have extra food on hand these days. You never know what major event can happen.
<user1> Oh my! Is she ok, and was it while surfing?
<user0> She's fine now. I spent a month in the hospital with her, then was with her every day for three months while she was in rehab. She was out spreading sacrificial lamb's blood in the water on a fishing trip. Gotta love her.
<user1> Did you recover the leg? And I once almost got my finger bit off by a snapping turtle, it wasn't a pleasant experience so I couldn't imagine hers. You are great for staying there.
<user0> It was swallowed whole, unfortunately. I just hope the shark seasoned it properly. I won't stand for underprepared human thigh meat. Gordon Ramsay wouldn't have it, and neither will I.
<user0> How could you? Oh dear now you would have to apologise
<user1> I called her right up and we rescheduled! I felt so bad though.
<user0> I am glad that you were able to reschedule
<user0> I am sure that was an interesting conversation.  What did your friend think?
<user1> They think someone needs to take his phone away
<user0> Lol   I think that even the people who like him would agree with that
<user0> That must have really been a wonderful surprise!
<user1> It was nice to find them all and think back to those simpler times
<user0> Yeah childhood ends way too fast it's great when we have a chance to reflect on them.
<user0> Nice, the windy city! Had you been before?
<user1> I had! I love chicago.  The flight is nice and short too, though I wasn't feeling well.
<user0> Ive never been but would love to go one day! Ah no what was wrong?
<user1> I think my electrolytes were off, I actually fainted on the plane and they made a whole to-do about it.
<user1> Aww, that is nice. Where did you study abroad?
<user0> I studied in Venice Italy and travelled all over Europe
<user1> Wow, how exciting! I also traveled Europe and Italy many years ago. I loved it!! Wish I could just move there. :)
<user1> Wow that's incredible. What was her anme?
<user0> Rita May. She used to mess with me by popping it out and showing me her empty eye socket just to get a laugh while she got drunk off of bourbon. Those were such good times.
<user1> Haha thats really funny. I bet she was a special person.
<user1> I am too! What are your plans?
<user0> Well In September, Universal Studios starts their Halloween Horror Nights events, after dark!  It's so much fun I can't wait to grab tickets.
<user1> I've been to Universal and everything else around there, but sadly never during halloween, I've always wanted to.
<user1> That's rare these days, I was with mine for 7
<user0> Nice. I wasn't rewarded though. They laid me off.
<user1> I hope you at least got a severance package!
<user1> Was it a bad one? And did she find out?
<user0> I was about school. And I eventually confessed.
<user1> Sometimes the lies get so heavy you just crack. Good for you though.
<user1> I know how hard that can be. Is it working out?
<user0> Yes. I was very happy to be gainfully employed.
<user1> It does take a lot of stress off of you.
<user1> I hope you are ok, what happened?
<user0> They were running from the police. It was nerve rattling.
<user1> I can believe so , Hope you get justice, and a paycheck!
<user1> That's always fun! Did you get anything cool?
<user0> They got me the new shoes I've been wanting. I was so elated and had such a good time!
<user1> YAY! I think shoes are a great gift.
<user1> Nice, how did it go? Was the guy nice?
<user0> Yes, really smart and easy to talk to.
<user1> That's great! Did you get the job?
<user0> I don't know yet.
<user0> That sucks. Do you know what caused the outage?
<user1> Someone crashed into the power line I think. It was so quiet and felt pretty spooky.
<user0> You don't realize how dependent we are on electricity until the lights go out.
<user0> Oh nice! That seems more likely than winning the state lottery. That would be so cool if you won!
<user1> Yes.  They were $100 but they only sell 500 tickets.  And the money raised goes to breast cancer research
<user0> That sounds like a really nice program. Where can I buy some tickets?!
<user1> jumpfortherose.com
<user1> Were they a close friend? And did you pay them with pizza?
<user0> Yes, and I paid them with beer. I was thankful because I had a toe injury.
<user1> I had a shoulder injury when i last moved, except I had to pay movers and pretend they were my friends for a day.
<user1> Sorry to hear that. What would you do if you won it?
<user0> I would have bought a new car and a house perhaps.  But I lost :-(
<user1> It is good to dream. Dreams can come true. :)
<user0> Yes.  Maybe next time I will win!
<user0> Oh , was it good? I've considered it.
<user1> It is good, but I sometimes wonder if I'm trading real life for a fantasy world.
<user0> Only if you are choosing that, over real tangible moments with friends or outside people.
<user0> That would take a miracle , or have some major money backing it.
<user1> Yes.  The Republicans just don't seem to care about our country any more and I am so mad that Putin owns Trump
<user0> Take some small steps and vote in other things for people with the right values, not just pandering to the ignorant.
<user0> Im sorry to hear that, how long did you have him?
<user1> For 4 years. I'm bummed.
<user0> Yeah that is a long time for a fish, do you have plans to get another one
<user1> Not yet.
<user1> What happened? 
<user0> The receptionist ignored me, and my interviewer was not prepared.
<user1> I hate when that happens, They expect us to be on point every time, yet they can't bother. I usually decline anything after.
<user1> oh no! Did you lose a lot of work?
<user0> I did. I hadn't saved, and I forgot to set up autosave. It was very frustrating.
<user1> I can relate. I have lost whole essays for the same reason. I had to call in sick for school because of it.
<user1> im a browns fan i feel that pain
<user0> I hate when teams choke. It makes me sick.
<user1> yea me too it sucks
<user1> You should probably go to the doctor about that
<user0> yeah I am going to see what it seems like tomorrow - not sure if something got in it that scratched it or what
<user1> You could have a tear on your eye. You really should get it checked out 
<user0> Yeah I will if it does not get better quickly
<user0> I bet that was fun, who did you go see?
<user1> I didn't catch his name, but he pulled a rabbit out of his hat. Classic trick, but I'll never forget it!
<user0> Magic is such a cool thing. That suspension of belief.
<user0> oh that's wonderful! Is it a job that you would enjoy?
<user1> Yes. It seems like a great opportunity.
<user0> that's great! I hope you do well and get the job. good luck!
<user0> That is good, what are you going to do to celebrate
<user1> I had a few drinks. I felt good.
<user0> that is always good, have one for me!
<user0> Aww, that was sweet of her. Does she do that often for you?
<user1> Yes, she's always helping me out! I am so thankful for her she's an amazing mother.
<user0> That's wonderful. It's nice to have someone in life who cares for your well being.
<user0> Oh wow. How far away did you move??
<user1> Out of state. I'm by myself now, so it's pretty quiet! I miss them a lot.
<user0> Awww! I know they miss you, too. I hope you're finding some fun with living on your own too!
<user0> I feel you. Last week, I spend 1000 dollars to fix my daughter's teeth. Dentists ask a lot of money now a days.
<user1> Yes they do. My aunt paid half of the cost for us and didn't has for any of it back because she knew we needed the help.
<user0> Ohh well that's good for you. These kind people always help in difficult times.
<user0> sounds good so far
<user1> It was! My family was happy and together. Chatting and watching tv. Everything just felt right.
<user0> thats a great feeling
<user0> Ohh He is so hardworking. You are very lucky.
<user1> Yeah, he does work hard. Even thought my children were with me and we kept our usual routines, I was miserable when he was gone. I would cry after he left every Sunday. Luckily now, he has a job where he is home everyday by supper time.
<user0> Ohh good for you. You two are made for each other!
<user1> We really are, he brings out the best in me.
<user1> oh thats great
<user0> Yeah it was so giving of them to leave it to me for so long and helped me a ton!
<user1> thats always super
<user1> I bet that gave you some good feeelings
<user0> Oh for sure. Good feelings, but I also miss her so much.
<user1> Yeah I bet. but atleast you have the memorys
<user1> O no! Can you fix it?
<user0> No, it's completely demolished! I'm feeling pretty annoyed.
<user1> Well it is not hard to build a mailbox im sure you can do it
<user1> now thats some super news
<user0> It is! It's a really big deal and I couldn't be happier for her.
<user1> thats great
<user1> what did they do?
<user0> He got us a trip to Hawaii! I couldn't believe it, I am so elated!
<user1> That is awesome! I bet your happy about that
<user1> Oh my gosh! How many did you adopt?!
<user0> Well it was only supposed to be her, but we found out she was pregnant! She popped out a whole litter of adorable.
<user1> Oh, I see! What a lovely surprise though. What did you do with her litter?
<user1> Yeah it is hard to leave our animals behind
<user0> It is very hard! The only one who I'd let do it was my sister and she did an amazing job.
<user1> That is nice of her!
<user1> Aww that's so cute! Did he enjoy it?
<user0> It's hard to tell! He refused to leave my side the entire time and just watched the other dogs play.
<user1> Poor guy was just nervous, I'm sure the more you take him the more he will venture away from you and have some fun!
<user1> Well hopefully he is understanding, if he is anything like my brother nothing a cold 6 pack won't fix.
<user0> Ha ha, he was a little miffed. He got over it though when I stopped and got him ice cream on the way back though! I felt like such a jerk.
<user1> All is well that ends well, especially with family they gotta give ya do overs.
<user1> That is a great idea! how is it so far?
<user0> I start next week! I was super hesitant at first, but I'm so glad I'm making myself do it.
<user1> Yeah you will improve yourself and feel good about it
<user1> thats great
<user0> Yeah, it really made me think of them and old times.
<user1> i bet it did
<user1> That's good, did you have to wait there or were you able to go home?
<user0> I was able to go home, but I realize now that I didn't even have to
<user1> Haha that;s rare when it comes to mechanics.
<user1> im sorry, thats awful. its a shame his parents arent being more supportive
<user0> They aren't being supportive at all, but that's not surprising, that don't support him very well in anything. I just wish I could make it better for him, but I can't
<user1> im sure he appreciates having you around though
<user1> That was really nice of them. I bet you're appreciative.
<user0> Yes I am, they are great
<user1> I'm sure you'll do a favor for them in the future.
<user1> Yikes! That is terrible! What a awful thing to do! I am glad he finally got busted! Wow, for years, huh?
<user0> Yes, it just makes me sick to my stomach. You think you know someone but the whole time they are stealing you blind. I don't get some people
<user1> Yeah, me either. Hopefully they regret what they did and are able to learn something from this.
<user1> I enjoyed highschool, too.
<user0> That's great. College was also fun
<user1> College was pretty laid back for me, I did a lot of online classes.
<user1> I am sorry for your loss. I hope you can find comfort during this difficult time.
<user0> Thank you, that means a lot. I will see her again
<user1> You will, and that is what gives us the strength to face tomorrow!
<user1> Happens to everybody. My girlfriend, who is the smartest person I know, has had to make 5 duplicates of her car keys because she's locked herself out so much. She's so forgetful because she's so efficient and on top of everything else important, that sometimes she misses the small things. Maybe that's true in your case, too!
<user0> That's pretty funny, and makes me feel better. This is the first time I've lost my keys so I hope to keep it that way!
<user1> I've heard some people place theirs in a bowl near the front door as soon as they come home, or they stick it in the fridge with their lunch.. silly things to make sure they can keep it together.
<user1> Wow. That must be a very special friend. I net you were surprised.
<user0> Yeah I sure was, he seems to like this one much better than the last one he had over. He couldn't wait for that first guy to leave.
<user1> Oh dear. Maybe he is a loner and doesn't like friends.
<user1> oh that's just a recipe for disaster 100% of the time.
<user0> Yeah I figured it was, so I just played dumb and let my supervisor know. My supervisor has always been good to me.
<user1> mine has too. i think you did the right thing by not getting involved.
<user1> Hm, who might that be? 
<user0> My buddy Stefan. He used it to print hundreds of bootleg concert posters. We sold them and netted $2000 a piece!
<user1> Thats neat. You must trust him a lot given his track record of making money!
<user1> Oh my goodness!  That's amazing!  Congratulations! Was it your first gold medal race?
<user0> Yes! It was my first victory. All my hard work is paying off
<user1> That is awesome! It is for running?
<user1> That sounds exciting and scary.  What was the surprise?
<user0> They had decided to pool their money together and get me one big present together. It was a flying lesson at the local airport. 
<user1> That is so awesome.  Did you have fun? and more important, are you a pilot now?
<user1> That's cool, did it bring back some good memories? 
<user0> Yeah, it did. I really miss the 90s. Everything seemed a lot simpler in those days
<user1> I love the 90's also, best decade in my opinion!
<user1> Oh no, did you get hurt?
<user0> Yes, the horse took off running and I got thrown into a metal fence. My mother then proceeded to yell and me and make fun of me for trusting her. She told me that I should never trust anyone not even my own parents, it was really embarrassing to get yelled at in from my friend. Afterwards my ribs hurt for 2 months.   
<user1> Yikes, I'm sorry to hear that.  That sounds horrifying!
<user1> So what did you do?
<user0> We went, but it was still pretty terrible because I felt completely uncomfortable and was bent over the whole time ready to catch myself.
<user1> Well, I bet your friend had a good time with you being there. Sometimes we have to make sacrefices for those we care about.
<user1> I'm sorry. My wife could sympathize with you since I'm gone a lot on business as well. 
<user0> Yes, its hard but I try to remember he does it for our family! I have been trying to adapt to enjoying alone time.
<user1> I'm sorry you feel lonely.  My wife says she ofens feels the same way.  I know your husband misses you awfully while he's away.  I love having chats with my wife every day when I'm gone.
<user1> Just be confident and you will do great!
<user0> I will try. I'm a pretty anxious person in general so it's hard
<user1> You got this! 
<user1> Ah, yeah moving can be hectic! Are you moving somewhere you want to be?
<user0> To my husband hometown so it'll be new for me but he is excited to be back near family.
<user1> That's a positive at least, good luck on the move!
<user1> Oh no!!! Did you see what happened to the dog?!
<user0> It was pretty tramatic, I still see the dog getting hit in my head and the sound. No, I was on my way to work, I couldn't stop :(
<user1> That's so sad! What on earth is a dog doing around a highway?! That just breaks my heart.. 
<user1> I can understand the anxiety. Its a whole new different experience for first timers!
<user0> Definitely! I get lightheaded when I see my own blood, and my pain threshold was low at the time. It turned out great though, and now I have several!
<user1> Same thing happens to me. I sometimes faint at the sight of a needle! Its good that your experience went well! Now you wont be nervous anymore. 
<user1> Aww! That is so cute! Has he done something special this week that made him extra sweet?
<user0> He knew I had a rough day today so he brought home my favourite wine and Taco Bell! It's the little things :)
<user1> That is so sweet of him. Its definitely the little things. 
<user1> Good! What's been going on?
<user0> I got a promotion at work that I wasn't expecting! 
<user1> Woo! Congrats on that! That's always a nice surprise. What do you do?
<user1> Yeah exactly!  Music is awesome.  
<user0> Who can deny it? My dad passed away 2 years ago. Sometimes I put on his old records and imagine what it would have been like to hang out with him in the 70s.
<user1> Yeah he sounds amazing.  Sorry for your loss friend :(
<user1> Never too old or too manly to snuggle a stuffed animal. My mom said I used to carry this blanket with me when I was a toddler, everywhere I went. I wish I still had it. If I did, I'd consider using it again, or at the very least passing it down to my own kid. What's the harm, you know? If something gives you comfort and doesn't bother anyone else, there should be no shame.
<user0> Awe yeah thanks. He's pretty soft even though he some derpy eye that point in opposite directions. Brings me a lot of comfort and reminds me that someone cares.
<user1> Well, if I were you, I'd keep it up, whether or not my spouse laughed at me, or a new girlfriend/boyfriend, whatever. It's not childish to me. Life is stressful enough. Let us snuggle what we want.
<user1> Aw! That's horrible, I'm sorry to hear that.
<user0> He did not live. I've never felt so sad before.
<user1> That's so sad, I don't even know what to say!
<user1> Oh no! That is really creepy, why is he in your backyard?
<user0> Turns out he was the cable guy fixing a wire. Still mad he didn't ask permisson first. 
<user1> Yeah, that's illegal I think, they need to at least knock or ring the door bell!
<user1> I am so sorry to hear that. It can't be easy for you and your family.
<user0> My siblings and I are managing, and have found some peace. My mother is a different story. It was just so sudden and unexpected.
<user1> No doubt it will take time to process. I wish your family the best. Stay strong my friend.
<user1> What shows are your favorite? That must be nice.
<user0> I like It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. I'm rewatching it for the third time
<user1> Must be nice, got any nice snacks?
<user1> Good choice. You're health is more important than some grad degree. 
<user0> That is what I was thinking at the time, but I've been having a really tough time finding a job where I can advance into a higher position. I always seem to get positions with no mobility.
<user1> I think nowadays employers just want experience. So it should be easier once you have that. 
<user1> Ah, I hate when that happens! How embarrassed were you?
<user0> It was pretty humiliating. I fell flat on my face.
<user1> Sorry to hear that. Hopefully you're not seriously hurt! 
<user1> You're sweet, what kind of soup did you make him?
<user0> I made chicken noodle soup. 
<user1> I love chicken noodle, he must be so grateful.
<user1> I bet that was a little embarrassing.
<user0> After I figured out what I did, I sure was. Ate at my cube ever since I don't even want to make eye contact with anyone.
<user1> I am sure it was not as bad as you think. 
<user1> Wow! What kind of meeting is it?
<user0> It's a meeting presenting a new product to the board. Big stuff and big money for the company.
<user1> Dang! I hope you have successful meeting then!
<user1> Oh no, was it romantic texts?
<user0> It was definitely a bit flirty. I think he misses being with her
<user1> That's sad. I hope you are OK.
<user1> That must be weird to talk to your ex still.
<user0> We actually get along really well and are much better friends than a couple. I guess I still just get a littler territorial, i think he does too. 
<user1> You must have feelings for him that are lingering.
<user1> Nice! It feels good to be confident. When do they come out?
<user0> On Monday. I'm going to treat myself if I did well
<user1> As you should. You must have good teachers too!
<user1> why? what happened to it? is it okay?
<user0> No, I had to put it down. It ate a poisonous plant. He should not have been outside.
<user1> that sounds terrible, i hope you didn't cry alot.
<user0> I cried a bit, but kept it together for my little girl because she had let him out.
<user0> Oh yeah?  Do you know someone that lives there?
<user1> Not really, I take my daughter to see them, so many of them have no visitors at all.
<user0> Yeah.  That's awesome that you do that though.  Makes for some special moments with your daughter and teaches her stuff.
<user1> She likes to bake, so we take them what she makes :)
<user0> That sounds cool!  I bet she cooks good!
<user1> She is pretty good for an eleven year old, better than I was.
<user0> haha same here!  
<user0> I am so happy for you that you have someone you can trust so completely.
<user1> Yes, I sure do! There aren't many people you can feel that way with and I am so grateful!
<user0> Hopefully she knows how much this means to you.
<user0> DID HE GET ACCEPTED? I HOPE SO
<user1> He did! He's in his 3rd year, going to be an Aerospace Engineer, so we are very proud of him.
<user0> OMG that's amazing, good on him! you must be so proud
<user0> oh wow, how did your mother handle this, how did you handle it . i can only imagine the pain.
<user1> It didn't really seem to sink in for my mother for awhile, she was in denial. But, it was so hard when it did. I went into a depression for awhile, as she was my only sibling and we were very close.
<user0> that is really painful, i hope everything becomes better soon.
<user0> where did he go study at? i can imagine how hard that could be. but it's good to see him following his dreams\
<user1> He went to the University of Alabama in Huntsville. It's focused on science, engineering, etc. He's going to be an Aerospace Engineer. It's great to see him go for his dreams!
<user0> aerospace engineer that sounds very interesting. hopefully he will stay focused and reach his goals.
<user0> aww that's amazing, i am going on vacation next week and i can't wait
<user1> That's great! I'm sure you earned it, just like we do. It's so good to get some time away from the hustle and bustle of life!
<user0> i know! i am sure you were able to recharge your batteries 
<user0> Do you have any special welcome-back events planned?
<user1> I am going to cook a special meal and see if he wants to go out, just us two. I know he will like that.
<user0> That sounds great. Does he travel often?
<user0> How exciting! I hope everything goes as planned!
<user1> Thanks! We've been married almost 23 years but I try to keep things fun and spend time together.
<user0> Sounds like you have a good relationship. I hope when I get married it turns out just as good.
<user0> aww. im sure you must feel proud of him
<user1> Yes, very. But, time sure has flown by with him growing up. I can just see his little blonde head when he was 5 and just starting school!
<user0> that sounds so cute
<user0> that is good news. its always good when what you learn helps you get ahead
<user1> Yes, thank you! I had worked very hard through the years, and I felt that I earned it, and would do well at it.
<user0> i hope you do well and excell
<user0> An adult did this? 
<user1> Yes, and she had two children of her own, similar in age. Her son also weighed more than mine! She did it because my son rode his bike through the corner of her yard as rode around the circle, that made her mad! Can you believe that??
<user0> I dont get people sometimes. Who does that that sort of thing.
<user0> Aww, they grow up so fast!!  How did she do?
<user1> It turns out she loves and and I was a mess for 8 hours for nothing. 
<user0> haha, I'm sorry you were so upset for nothing!  But it's so great that she loves school.  I hope she loves learning her whole life.
<user0> What went wrong?
<user1> I forgot everything. I guess I was so excited about the wedding, I totally failed at packing this time. Oh well, it was still fun.
<user0> That is all that matters, its about the love.
<user0> I understand. Did you told your friend?
<user1> I didn't....only because of her situation. She had custody of her very ill and handicapped infant grandson, she wasn't working so depended on him financially and she was very much in love with him. She already suspected he was with other women, and stayed.....
<user0> Wow, it is terrible.
<user0> Did you go see who it was?
<user1> No, I ignored them and they finally went away. I was just about to call the police before they left though. I hope that doesn't happen again.
<user0> No that's scary stuff.
<user0> That is great. What is it fun?
<user1> It was so much fun and such a happy night. I'm trying to embrace my age now and not ignore it any more
<user0> That is always difficult.
<user0> I am single and never been married. I assume arguments are part of marriage.
<user1> Yes, that's true. I tend to be a bit more verbal on my end and say things I regret later. 
<user0> Im bad at giving advice especially to people I dont know. Im the opposite. Im too mellow. And that sometimes gets me in trouble.
<user0> In some ways that is a bit funny but it certainly can be a scary time to come home alone to an empty dark house.
<user1> Yes, and I live out in the country so I wouldn't get a quick response time from emergency vehicles. But, luckily, it turned out to be my shadow!
<user0> I hope you aren't still scared of your shadow?
<user0> I don't think you should feel too bad about missing one day!  It sounds like you're generous regularly.  I get it though.
<user1> Well, homeless people aren't common in my area, so that's why I felt a bit bad about it. 
<user0> It's hard to see people and not be able to help.  You seem really giving!
<user0> Children are a beautiful thing for us parents. What a great memory you have of that. 
<user1> Yes, I have two children and I feel so blessed to have them. I lucked out and got a boy and girl, both healthy, smart and wonderful.
<user0> Thats perfect, a boy and a girl thats what most people want. congrats. 
<user0> In what do you believe?
<user1> Just that all people should be given an equal chance in life and that no one type of person is better than another, just because of their religion or skin color, or where they come from.
<user0> That is great. In what do your colleagues believe?
<user1> They believed that people of their religion where better than everyone else and were going to heaven, while the rest of us are left at the gate! That's one of their beliefs anyway. I don't agree with that, but chose to keep my mouth shut!
<user1> What car did you buy?
<user0> Just a Honda Civic. People drive crazy around here. I don't want to have another car accident like the last one.
<user1> Jeez. Where do you live? I dont remember any state Ive been to with bad drivers.
<user1> Good luck! My sister-in-law has been with weight watchers for a while now. She loves the camaraderie and how everyone encourages each other.
<user0> It has really helped to have their support. I am so grateful for them
<user1> You'll reach your goal. You just have to make small adjustments which'll sustain you throughout your life. How many meetings do you attend?
<user1> That test seems so hard. I probably couldn't even pass it. How did you do?
<user0> I passed! Turns out you only had to answer three questions correctly. But they have 50 to choose from so you have to study the lot!
<user1> I didn't know that. Congratulations. That's so awesome.
<user0> Thank you. My poor husband had to sit every single night and test me. He's American and he didn't think he could pass!
<user0> That must have been nice. I keep cards too.
<user1> It was so nice. I'm terrible about throwing cards out. I feel, if someone's taken the time to write, I should preserve it. Does that sound silly?
<user0> Of course not. There is so much paper in this house. I keep cards, photos, school projects. Everything. We arent here forever
<user1> That's very true. My Dad kept everything too. When he passed we had quite a task sorting through things. I think my brother's still at it!
<user0> I found lots of things to pass down when my grandmother passed. I think they passed down their hoarding to us lol
<user1> I believe you are right! My family are going to go nuts when they see what they've got to deal with, lol.
<user0> Lol. Me too!!
<user0> Why was it slippery
<user1> It had been raining , so I ran across the parking lot in to the store. I slid about 3 feet.
<user0> Oh no, were you okay
<user1> I was fine, just felt like every one was looking at me.
<user1> Oh no. Why are you keeping the secret?
<user0> I don't want to out her to her husband, usually the only thing that happens is they drop the friend.
<user1> Oh it sounds like you are in a difficult situation. I hope you can get out of the middle of it!
<user0> Thanks, I am just going to avoid them until it plays iteself out.
<user0> Oh I am sorry. Did you get any part?
<user1> I did, and it is a good one, just not the one that I wanted. I didn't want the lead or anything.
<user0> I am glad you got a good part. I am sure it is a let down to not get what you were hoping for though.
<user1> It is, my friend got it, or I wouldn't think about it so much. Thanks for the kind words though.
<user1> That is wonderful, I imagine she is very excited.
<user0> She is!  At first, though, she was very nervous.  I told her we could start off slow - her dad lives 1 mile from me down a quiet road, so we started driving back and forth between the two houses.
<user1> Okay i see well, take your time she will be getting her liscense soon
<user0> Hopefully by the first of the year.  We've worked up to driving to the dollar store 5 miles away.  She's still a little nervous but she's getting better and more confident the more we practice.
<user1> She just needs to get her confidence and I am sure you are a great teacher.
<user0> I do what I can where I can.  Can't wait for our hard work to pay off and she gets her license!
<user1> It will definitely paid off and I am rooting for her.
<user1> That can be overwhelming. Are you going to be cleaning all day then?
<user0> I'm going to try to.  If worst comes to worse, I'll just toss everything in my back bedroom, shiny up the floors and hope for the best!  *chuckle*
<user1> I'm sure you will get it done!
<user1> Thats neat. Do you guys make a lot of money?
<user0> We did and he was so precise with who got what and made sure he sent me my share quickly. He's such a neat brother in so many regards. I always know he'll be there for anyone who needs help.
<user1> I wish my siblings were like that. We should be more supportive and close like that
<user0> We weren't always close. When we were kids we were always fighting. It wasn't until we got older that we got closer. We're best of friends now.
<user1> I am jealous lol
<user0> Don't be! There are many, many types of relationships and I don't think ours is necessarily typical. It's just the way it is :)
<user1> I will work on it with my family. 
<user1> Wow!  It sounds like your kid is quite smart and gifted!  You must be really proud of him!
<user0> I am quite proud, thank you! I also have a teenage daughter that is very smart and an amazing artist, (which I don't know where she gets that talent). They really impress me with amazing they are!
<user1> Man, that is amazing that both your kids are so talented.  I hope my little ones are like that.  Congrats on your great parenting!
<user1> Are you able to learn the route first before you have to take it for your job or are they kind of just throwing you into it?
<user0> I got the assignment yesterday, and I told myself that I'd go drive around it today and tomorrow.  My boss is supposed to ride along with me the first week, and then after that I'll be on my own.
<user1> Well hopefully you're able to familiarize yourself quickly. Good luck!
<user1> Thats sad. Have you been to Scotand since?
<user0> Only for funerals, unfortunately. Both my parents have since died. Unpleasant fact of life, I'm afraid.
<user1> Im sorry to hear that. Were you born there?
<user0> Yes I was. I didn't come to the US until I was in my 30s. Didn't expect my Grandma to pass the minute I got here, but she was 96, so it shouldn't have been such a surprise!
<user1> 96! Wow. Thats a full life!
<user0> She was as fit as a flea too. She tripped and broke her hip and got a bad infection in the hospital. That's what she died of!
<user1> Wow. She probably couldve kept going for years if it wasnt for that.
<user1> Excellent! Are you enjoying it?
<user0> I am! I bought Halo and am ready to ride.
<user1> Sick. I hope it's as fun as it looks!
<user1> I am glad that she is living close to you. That must make you feel special. My mom is dead so I understand how you feel.
<user0> I'm sorry to hear that, I know it's so hard to lose a parent. I think we take them for granted when we are younger, but I am blessed she's still here.
<user1> I am happy that your mom is still around. Cherish the days that you spend together.
<user1> are they typically bad or something?
<user0> The live upstairs and constantly thump around, screeching into their cellphones. And then there's the video games...
<user1> Oh that makes sense, well enjoy the peace and quiet!
<user0> Oh I am, believe me I am. The world seems like a calm, serene place where everything is just right!
<user0> Thats awesome. What did you guys do?
<user1> We ended up hanging out and recording some audio. He is a voice actor
<user0> that sounds fun!
<user0> Poor thing! What did you do?   Did you take it home with you?
<user1> We actually did, and ended up adopting him. He was still so young he needed formula, but now he is thriving!
<user0> eww,  that is great you took such great care of him.  
<user0> That 's nice of you.  Did you keep it as a pet
<user1> I did not, I was little but I think I put it back into a tree
<user0> Cool.  Some birds shouldn't be in captivity.  What kind of bird was it
<user0> That is a nerve-racking experience. But I'm betting you did graduate and did just fine!
<user1> Yep, had to take a class online over the summer but it worked out
<user0> Congratulations! Waiting for results can be very stressful - everything's out of your hands and all you can do is wait.
<user0> I'm sure she understands, just tell the truth!
<user1> I just feel so embarrassed - she never forgets my birthday. And my husband was away and didn't remind me :( 
<user0> Yeah, I'd be pretty scared too, but it's better to be upfront about it to get it off your chest
<user1> You're right. She's a very forgiving person and I've never forgotten before. It's on St. Paddy's day for heavens sake - how could I forget???
<user1> Oh boy. Did you not get the memo that you were supposed to be wearing a dress?
<user0> I thought that it was a pajama party haha, never worn a dress before, maybe that's the secret
<user1> Everyone looks good in a dress. Just make sure to shave first.
<user1> Oh man, I did too.  I still do every once in a while but only when I'm having trouble sleeping.  Does one stand out from the rest that you remember vividly?
<user0> Yeah, it was like I was tied to a chair and a huge thing was staring at me, pretty weird
<user1> Creepy! I once had a dream of a Lion laying at the end of my bad. It was scary but also comforting.  I feel like I could've touched it. Glad you're free of those dreams now.
<user1> So you probably felt pretty guilty huh. Did you return what you stole?
<user0> No, I was scared to get charged, but I stopped after that
<user1> Glad to hear you stopped with your wayward habits before the Po Po caught up with you!
<user1> I've always liked the idea of meditation, but I feel like it'd be hard. My mind is always racing!
<user0> Yeah, thankfully there's an app for that - Headspace (no I am not sponsored)
<user1> Awesome, I'll check that out! I hear all sorts of great things about meditation.
<user1> Me too, do you have any special plans?
<user0> I want to go see the Harry Potter land at Universal, the kids will love it.
<user1> How fun! yes I am sure they will have  a great time!
<user0> They love the films, plus getting to ride Hogwarts Express, score!
<user0> Is it for college?
<user1> Law School, I'm pretty sure I got in to my first choice, but you never know.
<user0> Well good luck, I hope you get in!
<user1> Thank you, fingers are crossed.
<user1> I love cooking! What types of things do you like to cook?
<user0> I'm vegetarian and cook all sorts of different cuisines - Indian, Italian, American. The only cuisine I'm not good at is Chinese. How about you?
<user1> I am also a vegetarian and I love cooking Italian food.
<user0> Have you heard of Mark Bittman's book How to Cook Everything Vegetarian? That's the book I'm waiting impatiently for!
<user0> Those are so much fun. Was everyone hype?
<user1> Yee yee, it landed on this little ledge that was super high up.
<user0> Tight. Probably wont be able to do that again!
<user0> Oh my gosh, so tiny. I'm hoping since he was released from the hospital he is doing well now?
<user1> He is doing well, thank you. And we are so thankful everything is ok. It was touch and go for awhile
<user0> I can imagine. I'm glad to hear he's better! Life is such a gift.
<user0> That is really nice that you guys have that trust.
<user1> I hope to make her my wife some day!
<user0> That is an awesome goal! Good luck!
<user0> I hope it didn't mess up your clothes. I'm sure it was a mistake.
<user1> It was indeed a mistake. My clothes are fine now.
<user0> I'm glad it didn't mess anything up and that your relationship with your sister is still in tact.
<user0> Oh no. I rent also so I know your pain. My last landlord was awful.  How did your landlord react?
<user1> He decided to start caring and doing his part.
<user0> Oh good, glad he did that instead of just coming down on your for not paying.  Glad it worked out for you.
<user0> Lucky you did that in time!
<user1> Right, I caught it just as it happened and brought it to the shop, didn't cost as much as I thought it would either.
<user0> Sounds like it worked out great for you!
<user0> Wow! You should do something back for her!
<user1> I think I am getting her a gift soon!
<user0> Nice, I am jealous of your friendship!
<user0> Was it something important that you took ?
<user1> It was some Pokemon cards!
<user0> I see, did they ever find out it was you ?
<user0> That is awful, I am sorry to hear that.  Is he doing better now?
<user1> Yes, he has made a full recovery! It's been a journey
<user0> I'm so glad he is better.  Is the whole family doing alright?  I know that can be really hard on people.
<user0> Life was easier back then, Hopefully you still love life?
<user1> I do, but maybe not with he same flare as before
<user0> Nostalgia can stir emotions. You'll find something to love about life again.
<user0> Oh, no!  What happened?  Did she just get loose?  
<user1> Yes they both just wandered off when the door was open!
<user0> Thankfully, they are both okay.  Dogs or cars, or anything for that matter could get them!
<user0> What?
<user1> I recently got an A on my paper. I feel great.
<user0> Congrats! I bet that feels great!
<user0> That is embarrassing. I would hate to have that happen.
<user1> Yeah, we all have a good laugh about it now
<user0> That is the best way to handle those situations.
<user0> Ouch! I can relate. What made you decide to drink a whole gallon in a day?
<user1> I wanted to see how hard it would be, turns out my stomach was JUST big enough
<user0> Haha! I hope you experience no seriously ill effects!
<user0> Sheesh that is brutal, did you smack him?
<user1> No, but I don't think he is my friend any more
<user0> I don't blame you, that is low.
<user0> Me neither, I hate it when they just wont leave you alone
<user1> Right, it kind of feels like they're insecure with their abilities while trying to make me feel bad at the same time
<user0> Yes! I feel the same
<user0> Always try to brush your teeth at least twice a day, it helps
<user1> Yeah that's what my dentist says, I'll try
<user0> If you don't take care of your teeth then you will have a bad time later in life
<user0> That is bizarre, have you had this seen about?
<user1> I think it's from dreams that I'm not able to recall
<user0> That is odd, are you afraid when you wake up?
<user0> You sound a lot like my husband. He is really into going to the gym. Life isnt right if he doesnt get gym time.
<user1> Yeah, it's fun to see how much you can conquer yourself, and it's nice to be able to see how you're changing
<user0> I agree. Its pretty cool to see the changes. I never really got into going to the gym though. 
<user0> I have been skydiving, too! It was a fun experience.
<user1> It was excellent. I feel so alive!
<user0> I lost my hearing for a few hours after though, but other than that it was a wonderful experience.
<user0> That is great, did something recently happen?
<user1> I recently finished a new album I have been working on!
<user0> Awesome! What type of music?
<user0> What possibilities do you speak of?
<user1> Being able to learn basically anything with the internet for one
<user0> That sounds pretty exciting.
<user0> I've never been much for meditating. I'm glad you enjoy it.
<user1> For sure, my mind is pretty energetic
<user0> What got you into meditation?
<user0> I think that's a good idea so you aren't always dependent on others to have fun and just enjoy time to yourself.
<user1> True, and I've felt that way before, but sometimes like a wave of those kinds of feelings hits like I'm not worthy enough and stuff like that, but it's all good
<user0> Meditation on goals and positive ideas during some of that alone time can be so uplifting and refocuses you.
<user0> I used to struggle with the same problem, it can be overwhelming
<user1> Right, but things always seem to turn out for the best anyway
<user0> I agree!!
<user0> Grats.  How long have you been working out for?
<user1> around 9 months, been pretty slow to make progress but overall it's been solid
<user0> Keep your diet clean and you'll keep improving.
<user0> That sounds nice. Hopefully it isn't too hot for you.
<user1> I hope not. I'm in Florida so it might get bad
<user0> Are you going to be sleeping in a tent?
<user0> That's just so sad. House fires are terrifying to me.
<user1> Yeah, it was built a long time ago, some kind of electrical fire
<user0> The wiring was probably old and not up to code anymore.
<user0> did it go flat?
<user1> It did not, got it replaced when I dropped it off, pretty lucky
<user0> that is very fortunate!
<user0> That is really nice of you!  Is the cat OK now?
<user1> Yeah, everything turned out fine in the end
<user0> That's good.  If not for you, who knows what could have happened.  You must be a very caring individual.
<user0> I think that is a lovely thing
<user1> It's like if I don't get that sorted out I won't be able to live a fulfilling life
<user0> If its important, you will figure it out
<user0> Yea, its a good idea to take time for yourself when you can
<user1> Right, it's like I can't focus or relax
<user0> I think relaxing is very important
<user0> Yeah as a child it's hard to see other kids with a bunch of friends when you don't have that many.
<user1> Yeah, I just had trouble socializing is all
<user0> Well, I hope you got over that issue and ended up making lots of friends yourself.
<user0> Oh man! thats impressive, those baths are rough.
<user1> Yeah, my bath wasn't deep enough, so I didn't get covered all the way!
<user0> That's good. But still! You must be pretty tough!
<user0> Are you taking protein?
<user1> I'm taking everything, honey, raw garlic, yogurt, EVERYTHING!
<user0> That is good, hopefully it helps!
<user0> I agree, were you recently screwed by one?
<user1> Yeah, it's like they live to manipulate people for money
<user0> Yep its disgusting
<user0> That is sweet of you, kids are cute
<user1> They are but when I finally got it open it sprayed me from my waste all the way to my hair! 
<user0> Oh that is not good, I hope you were able to clean it up easily...
<user0> Wow I haven't thought of them in years.  Sometimes it is good to have bands you can always go back to
<user1> Haha, I didn't grow up with them but it's like discovering a gold mine that no one else seems to listen to
<user0> True.  I have favorite bands to that I consider to be musical comfort food
<user0> Nice! Are you getting a car soon too?
<user1> Yeah, that was a while ago, cars are great in a lot of situationsz!
<user0> Definitely, especially when you get really hungry at night. I love a good drive thru
<user0> That is awful. I've had it happen to me once before.
<user1> Yes it's been hell, they charged over 15 thousand dollars on it. I hope my identity is fine besides the card.
<user0> I sure hope so, too! It is a lot of work to get it sorted out. 
<user0> Yeah... that seems like a hard gig, especially in today's day and age, where everyone's so wary, and especially since there's not often people at home during the day. You have to have good people skills to do that job, though. So, you at least probably have that going for you.
<user1> I realized that it was unethical in the end!
<user0> Ah.. yeah, I'm sorry you had to run into that kind of problem. It's hard doing a job you don't agree with the ethics of. There's really no way to fake it sometimes. But at least you were able to realize that and stand by your morals.
<user0> Is he going out drinking?
<user1> Yes, I'm exhausted. My daughter is teething so she hasn't been sleeping well.
<user0> That is such a tough time, my son is teething as well
<user0> Well I am not a religious person but I will have to say it urks me when I am surronded my religious people that is trying to push their belief on me. Then seeing them feel people heads with stuff that they can not prove is there irritates me also
<user1> Exactly, I feel that getting people to believe irrational things is the same as giving them a brain virus, it'll slowly erode their ability to think rationally.
<user0> Lol. exactly how I feel
<user0> Oh, thats not unusual. You must try to relax. Is it an important presentation?
<user1> Kind of, but I have prepared a lot so I'm sure it'll go good! I work in the human resource department for a big company and we are trying to find new ways to retain good employes.
<user0> I see, I hope it goes well for you. Remember to breathe! 
<user0> That is a scary situation. People do not care anymore.
<user1> Right, there's too many people to say that it wouldn't happen
<user0> You are so right! 
<user0> That is awesome, what degree are you working towards?
<user1> Healthcare administration, only 6 months left! I get so antsy waiting to see the final grades, it drives me crazy 
<user0> I can imagine, waiting sucks!
<user0> That's kind of odd. I probably would have tried to take a swing just out of pure instinct. What was the reason they wanted to wake you up?
<user1> I don't know, I didn't answer, pretended I was asleep
<user0> Hahaha.. that's kind of goofy in a way. Yeah, sometimes nothing good can come of people trying to get your attention randomly in the middle of the night. That's probably the wisest choice. I probably wouldn't be able to act that good enough to pull it off.
<user0> Ouch!  What did you take?
<user1> A computer keyboard from my school
<user0> Was it an awesome keyboard worth getting in trouble for?
<user0> Congrats! Thats so exciting do You fel ok?
<user1> Yes, a bit nervous because my first birth was hard, but I know I'm ready and have everything we need for the baby! 
<user0> YAY! good job! He/she is going to be beautiful
<user0> I still think it is, i always get so excited
<user1> Yeah, it's like there's nothing to worry about
<user0> yep thats one of the things that make it so nice
<user0> Oh wow that is weird. Did you say anything to him?
<user1> I was like what the hell, and then he said sorry and walked out
<user0> Yeesh, how awkward is that.
<user0> Were you able to take the plate id?
<user1> No, I didn't see it someone reported it to customer service and they paged me. I wish they would have left a note! People have so decency sometimes!
<user0> I understand. Sorry to hear about that.
<user0> Oh nice. What kind of candy was it?
<user1> This sour s'ghetti candy by HARIBRO. I use to eat this all the time as a child.
<user0> Oh yeah I think I have tried that one! I love anything by Haribro! 
<user0> Glad to hear it. I hate hearing about children having tragic childhoods and not being able to just simply be a kid. But at least she'll have a good perspective and appreciate life more.
<user1> Thank you, Defenitly! She is still young and most likely won't remember this either! 
<user0> Even if she does, it will help make her a well-rounded, relatable person. Usually these things help ground kids and give them character. But maybe you're right, if she moves on from it quickly, that's great too!
<user0> What had he made in the world?
<user1> He had created one giant hole and filled it up with water, super cool
<user0> That's super cool, I played a few years back but eventually quit.
<user0> I am really sorry to hear that.  I hope everything is alright.
<user1> Yes, his work told him he couldn't go after they already approved the time off. Guess next month is going to be busy at his work :(
<user0> Well, that is just terrible.  I hate it when companies jerk you around like that.  I hope you will be able to reschedule it, although I know that wouldn't make up for the frustration.
<user0> that is a great way to look at it
<user1> Glad you think so as well!
<user0> Yeah more people should look at life like you do
<user0> did you call the exterminator?
<user1> Not yet since it's the weekend. We live in Texas so they are common but still gross! I'm glad I haven't see any in my house.
<user0> I live in Texas to so i know those feels
