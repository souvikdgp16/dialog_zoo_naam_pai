<user1> Well, this isn't going to make me sound like the manliest individual ever, but I think I need to tell it to someone. A few weeks ago, I was driving home from work. It was late. i was tired. So I wasn't my usual self. I was singing along to some song when all of a sudden I glanced up and saw two eyes looking back at me, and at the time I didn't know whos eyes they were so I was scared to death. I slammed on my breaks, in the middle of the road, jumped out, and was ready to run... I mean fight whoever was in my back seat. Long story short, I saw my own reflection in the mirror.

As it turns out, this chimney guy fabricates a type of gutter for chimneys to keep the water from running down the rock.  For $300 he made and installed the "gutter" on site, and I have had NO leaks!

<user1> A bunch of fruit flies appeared in my apartment out of nowhere the other day. I think it's because of some old veggies in my fridge. Totally gross. __eou__ <user0> Oh man, those things are awful and reproduce like crazy.  We left our house for a week and came back to tons of them everywhere! The best trick is putting a little apple cider vinegar in a jar, a drop of dish soap on top of that and cover it with cling wrap and put holes in it.  They will gravitate toward it and you'll catch a bunch! Just keep changing it every few days.

Its been hard for our daughter __eou__ <user0> I think it might actually be harder to watch our kids go through that kind of loss than to actually go through it ourselves.  Our pup was our daughter's dog and she was sick prior to passing, so we knew it was coming.  Still doesn't really help though.  We ended up adopting a pup from the shelter that had lost her human mom - it was meant to me - my daughter lost her pup and this pup had lost her mom.  It's helped, something to think about at least.
