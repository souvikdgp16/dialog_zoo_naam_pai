<user1> Are you fine now?
<user0> Yeah,i'm doing alright now, but with minor injuries.
<user1> Cool :) Is your car damaged a lot?
<user0> The car was badly damaged,i veered outside the road and hit a tree trunk. next thing is insurance follow up.
<user0> That's funny, hope he didn't give you a heart attack.
<user1> I may have let out a scream that will have him question my manhood for the rest of our lives, lol. 
<user0> I would probably scream also.
<user0> Wow! That sounds amazing. Where are you going? 
<user1> Traveling to South Africa then to Ghana. Also my first time visiting Africa
<user0> You are going to love it I am sure. Safe Travels! 
<user0> Thats horrible, hope he is ok.
<user1> yeah, he had just drank a bottle, and I was moving him around like an airplane. In retrospect. I deserved it.
<user0> I see, glad he is ok.
<user0> Hi, how are you?
<user1> Im doing great i just wanted to tell you a short story about a time i helped an elderly lady.  She was struggling to carry her bags from a trip she had took.  I helped her carry them to her door ! Pretty good feeling when you help others 
<user0> That was kind of you, I am sure they appreciated that!
<user0> My last vacation went horribly wrongQ!
<user1> All I thought about was being at home again and being able to relive those moments.
<user0> Yes I love to reminice
<user0> Im sorry to hear that. I have never had a dog. What was your experience of the dog?
<user1> The dog was there with my throughout my life. He saw me through boyfriends and friends.
<user0> I am really sorry to hear that. What was the dogs name?
<user0> Hello How are you and what is your story chat about today? 
<user1> I locked my keys in my car about a week ago. It was 95 degrees outside and I was at the store getting groceries.
<user0> OMG wow.... i hope you got it open quick! 
<user1> luckily there are police who patrol around the mall on the other end of the parking lot. one of them got it open for me
<user1> Hi, a few months ago, my mother found some stray dogs that were starving, so she told us about them. Of course, we brought the poor babies to our house, a mother dog and her two puppies. My heart went out to them, as their ribs were showing, but they were still so loving and sweet.
<user0> Oh no im so sorry to hear that :/ Thats good that you took them in 
<user1> Yes, I really felt so much sympathy for them and we all really liked them. We already had several pets, so I wasn't going to keep them, but I wanted to help them get better and find them a good home. We did for all of them, with the puppies being able to stay together.
<user1> That is really nice to see... I bet it made you feel good! So sweet. 
<user0> yeah it made me feel great :)
<user1> Nice to still see that behavior in todays world. :)
<user1> Thats sweet that you remember that, how old were you? 
<user0> I was around 10 years old I think, it was quite a long time ago for me now haha!
<user1> I wont make you reveal your age! lol :p 
<user0> Hah appreciated, have you ever received a fun gift?
<user0> That's wonderful. How long have you guys been dating?
<user1> We have been together for close to 5 months now, so not very long haha!
<user0> Time flies by pretty fast. Could be together 10 years from now!
<user1> I hope so haha, are you dating anyone?
<user1> congratualtions. what do you do?
<user0> I work in I.T. for the provincial government in Canada :)
<user1> oh wow. we're practically neighbors.
<user1> How big was the deck?
<user0> I think its probably about 20 feet by 25 feet? I'm bad at guessing that kind of stuff hah
<user1> Wow that is big.
<user1> What is scary about what she is doing? I'm not quite understanding what you mean.
<user0> Well, when shes dealing with her own personal issues she tends to kind of just vanish, I haven't talked to her in a few days and it's making me worry.
<user1> Oh wow, I can see why you're worrying. You should really talk to her about all this if she comes around soon.
<user1> Thats great. Did you create the script?
<user0> Yeah, had to google a bit of it but it worked out well.
<user1> I love google. It is my favorite search engine.
<user1> Thats wonderful news! Its such a nasty disease! How long has he been clear? 
<user0> About 2 years now.
<user1> Well I hope he has 100 more years to go! :) 
<user1> Have you tried to call her?
<user0> I have, but she's going through a rough time and likes to seclude herself.
<user1> Maybe give her space.
<user1> What birthstone is it.
<user0> It is amethyst.
<user1> What birthstone is it?
<user1> I love to play Madden.
<user0> Do you play Madden often?
<user1> Yes, every day.
<user1> Where is she?
<user0> She's in the same city as me, but she's going through a hard time and has decided to seclude herself so I can't reach her.
<user1> Just give her space.
<user1> Thats great.
<user0> Yes, she picks up on things that I didn't even think she knew about.
<user1> Did you teach her?
<user1> Did you stay and ride it out? I bet it was quite a thing to see!
<user0> Yes, I've been surfing for ever. Only three of us in the water. 
<user1> That must be so much fun. I have never surfed but love to be on a boat. 
<user0> You are never to old to start. I'm teaching my mate and he is 70 I think. Hopefully I have a boat soon.'
<user1> Wow I hope I am fit enough at 70 to surf!
<user1> Wow, 4 children my first is on the way and I'm freaking out. You must have great friends.  
<user0> That is so exciting, congratulations! We moved 17 hours away from family, so having a great group of friends is really important to us. 
<user1> Thank You. That is our next step we are moving from NYC to Miami after the baby. How can we find friends like yours? 
<user0> Get involved in something. Church, a social club for interests you are in. I don't recommend parent groups, for some reason they get really nasty. Just find a way to connect with people. Having children is so much harder without a support system!
<user1> I see what you mean about a parents group. I joined a dads group in facebook and it's full of people who complain non stop about  being an adult. 
<user1> That sounds fun, I was never any good at painting
<user0> I am not either, but they had an instructor to follow along to! :)
<user1> That probably helps a good deal!
<user1> I wish I had a rubber bumper to ram those people with!
<user0> After the Apocalypse I'll just ran them off the road. To make things worse he was in a Horse and Buggy. 
<user1> That is terrible, he could have hurt the horse!
<user0> That's what me the most mad. It's like he did not care at all. 
<user0> Nice, congratulations. How are you liking the new job itself?
<user1> It's pretty good so far, I think I'm gonna like it for the long haul!
<user0> Awesome, I hope the job goes great for you!
<user0> Thats sad, hopefully the new cat got to live a long and full life with you
<user1> Well, we had a funny twist. The same day we brought the new kitten home, or old cat showed up. We kind of thought maybe he was hanging out close to home and was mad that we replaced him.
<user0> Haha thats crazy, I hope they became best friends, I love cats.
<user0> I can imagine! That extra set of hands -- and a person you can *trust* -- that's the best!
<user1> Yes, the kids really missed her when she left. It took us a while to get back to the normal around here.
<user0> Does she live far away? It sounds like maybe visits aren't too frequent.
<user0> An hour? Damn for somewhere as meh as Denny's that really isn't worth it.
<user1> Its really not, the foods not worth that long of a wait.
<user0> I haven't been there in so long for that exact reason.
<user0> Oh really? What happened that made you look bad?
<user1> I went to the bathroom real fast before we went into the dining room. I tucked my dress into my panty hose and didn't even notice. I walked past everyone with my underwear showing. I'm sure I'll laugh about it... someday. 
<user0> Oof yea that seems like it might take a few years or 10 before you can laugh at it but at least its over.
<user0> That's awesome! My experience was quite opposite as I sat waiting in the dentist chair for a 2 1/2 hour procedure!
<user1> That sounds unpleasant, did you get in afterwards?
<user0> Yes! I'm actually glad it's over :) So, how long did it take you to fix the computer problem?
<user0> Yeah, that is pretty annoying to have happen.
<user1> I called them and did not hold back. 
<user0> Good man! That is your money and they just wanna snatch from you.
<user1> I was going to go down and go nuts but my wife stopped me. 
<user1> It sounds like you're happy for her, which is commendable given you didn't get hired. Were you very disappointed?
<user0> I was kind of envious that she got the job and I didn't because it seemed like I was more qualified than she was.
<user1> That's always tough. It's so hard to tell what other factors come into play in situations like that. Are you happy where you're currently at, or still looking?
<user1> I'm so sorry about that. It sounds like you're doing your best to be supportive.
<user0> Thanks, I am definitely trying to be as supportive as I can, she's my world.
<user1> She's very lucky to have you. I wish you guys the best!
<user1> I am very nostalgic too, that must be a fun time!
<user0> Yes, until you realize that it was 20 years since you played there, and you start feeling old
<user1> That is true, but it is part of life, but it is cool to see things again, regain perspective
<user1> I'm sure it did! It's not easy to have to adapt to another person's habits.
<user0> I know. It caused some tension the first week or so. I had to take a deep breath, and realize its just things, and it was just me being reluctant to change. 
<user1> Yes, sometimes we have to learn to let go of the little things so we can appreciate the more important things. It sounds like you have done a great job!
<user1> I believe you are really sad although it's a fact of life
<user0> Yes. You get to see them change and grow. It makes it all worth it. 
<user1> True, and the good thing is that when the kids grow, they provide moral support to parents.
<user1> Maybe she did and remembered last minute. You should ask her!
<user0> She remembered but was trying to draw it out to make me think that she had forgot. I should have known because I made her wait until 10 pm on her birthday.
<user1> Next year I would just forget her birthday all together!
<user1> Is he a stay at home father, or does he just not want to work?
<user0> He's 20 he just wants to party and sleep.
<user1> I am sorry to hear that. Maybe as he gets older he will get his priorities in order and see how hard you work.
<user0> Doubtful, he's a punk!
<user0> Must of been pretty surprised, Also great to have friends like that.
<user1> It really was! They even had my favorite kind of cake, chocolate mousse from my favorite bakery! 
<user0> That must of just made everything even better!
<user1> Right?! I mean who doesn't love cake. But that's not even the best part. on the counter, there was a HUGE pile of presents calling my name. 
<user1> That is a great news. You surely have done a great job.
<user0> Best Ever. I didn't have a clue I was going to get it. I just walked in and boom got a raise.
<user1> You are very lucky
<user0> Your not kidding and to think I was going to quit. 
<user0> No I haven't actually, I recently just canceled my netflix service! I have been thinking about resubscribing though. 
<user1> Why did you cancel your subscription? If you ever re-subscribe i would definetly recommend checking out "within"!
<user0> I could not find the content that was best suited for me personally to consider it worthy at the time, but if I do I will definitely check it out!
<user0> Was the color of red that different to show on the red carpet?
<user1> Very! It was a dark maroon stain. 
<user0> Oh! wow that must of been pretty obvious then.
<user0> Argh! That's tough! Have you been able to come from a place of authentic apology? It can be easy to be defensive in those situations, which of course only makes it worse!
<user1> I'm still working on it. she has has not given me much of a chance. 
<user0> What's your approach? Does humor ever work....? You know, like wearing a dunce cap while holding a huge bouquet of flowers? Or going John Cusack and holding a boombox overhead, playing "your" song?
<user1> I used diamond earrings. 
<user1> You should not be so insecure like that.
<user0> Its not about insecurity! 
<user1> What is about them? Do you think he is better than you?
<user1> yes, several times.The place is magical.
<user0> I'm actually going for the first time in my adult life this fall! I'm really excited!
<user1> Well, you are about to have the fun of your life, but gamble responsible.
<user1> Why. Did you started dating recently or something
<user0> No we'd been dating a very long time but he was never the traditional kind. Never wanted an official ceremony but after meeting me i guess it all changed!
<user1> The most important thing is what you want.
<user1> Really?? are you famous then? What is your name?
<user0> Yes, you can google me.
<user1> Are you still competing on a professional level?
<user0> Nope, I've got a family now to support so I surf less and work more. But I've still got killer moves. 
<user0> NOT THE TACOS!!!! Seriously, I can understand how frustrating that is. Especially when you have the taste for something.....then gone!
<user1> It's not like I could back in. I waited in line 20 minutes and had been looking forward to them all day. I had to skip lunch due to work being busy. I'm still mad.
<user0> Even worse. I'm so sorry. What did you do instead?
<user1> A bowl of dry cereal. 
<user0> Laughing *and* crying for you! Next time!
<user1> Text time I'm going to treat those sweet fatty taco's like the baby of Jesus. I get heated up just thinking of it.
<user0> I wish I could emoticon this whole thing.....a string of cry-laughing. I wish I could treat you to lunch there!
<user0> I have not! I used to run a lot for soccer practices. Have you?
<user1> I have not either! My best friend recently recovered from a broken leg and just completed her first full marathon, it was inspirational!
<user0> That's great for her. 
<user0> hahaha thats funny why are you still afraid of the dark?
<user1> I am not scared of the dark. I am just scared of the things in the dark. And the ironic thing is, I don't even believe in the supernatural, so I am scared of the dark to just be scared of it, I think. 
<user0> OOO so you think something else is hiding in the dark and that's why your scared?
<user1> Nope. I am just scared that in case there is the supernatural. It makes sense in my head;however, when I am saying it out loud, it doesnt, lol
<user1> That's probably the best thing to do before you go to work for a place. Were you happy with your results?
<user0> I was!  It ended up securing me the job because the company itself is small so the CEO and interviewer were really impressed..
<user1> Sometimes it's the extra step someone is willing to do that will make it. Good for you!
<user0> Thank you!  I really enjoy this position a lot so I am happy it turned out well.
<user0> I feel the same way when I'm away from my cat.  Does he have to travel a lot for work?
<user1> Sometimes he does.  Lately there hasn't been any local work so he has had to go out of state and its just too far to come back.
<user0> Maybe one day if you have the time, you can pay him a surprise visit.
<user1> That is a good idea! I'll have to sneak his work schedule and give it a try.
<user1> That is good. Where you running late
<user0> I was running late and so did the bus.
<user1> That sucks. I hate when I am running late I always feel behind
<user1> I don't think you should feel bad, you didn't know!
<user0> Yeah but he just seemed so disappointed when he came home for lunch.
<user1> I'm sure he will be okay. Maybe you can make it up to him.
<user0> I should probably just buy him another pizza soon.
<user1> Sounds like a good idea.
<user1> Aw. Children will make us do things we NEVER thought we would (or could) do! 
<user0> Yes! I start swimming lessons next week. I have went 32 years without knowing how to swim, and that one visit changed all that. 
<user1> That is SO exciting! Congratulations! You are a fabulous role model for your son.
<user1> Oh that's so sweet. My grandmother is a great person too and I'm glad to know her.
<user0> She was a lovely lady indeed!  I miss our time together a lot especially when I hear the music she used to listen to.
<user1> I think it's great that you have such positive memories of her, that way she'll always be there in some form.
<user1> Yes, I love to visit the zoo!  
<user0> I recently went back to Michigan and got visit my old town and even the High school I had such great times back then.
<user1> What were some of your favorite things to do back in highschool?
<user0> I played Football all 4 years, used to Skateboard in the parking lot and hang out in the auto shop. The good old days.
<user0> That is wonderful!. It is always nice to have at least one good parent.
<user1> Well my dad too but my mum was so much more, even when I was naughty she was still there.
<user0> My mom was pretty awesome too! I'm glad you had a good one as well.
<user0> That is bad. Are you still afraid a lot?
<user1> I am, everytime I see a dog, I begin to run the other direction instantly
<user0> You need to fight your fear
<user0> wow that's very sad!  I am really sorry!
<user1> No, it's not sad. I really like to be alone, as i'm an introvert. I need my space.
<user0> Well I guess if that is something you enjoy.  I can't say that I have alot of friends.  Mostly my friends are family 
<user1> Well in that case, I have a few friends. Outside of family, I don't. 
<user1> Yes I do actually, I was almost in an accident because of rain at night once. 
<user0> That's so scary! I am always on edge in those cases. I hydroplaned really bad last time.
<user1> I'm glad you were okay and nothing bad happened. 
<user0> Thank you. I've never been in a traffic accident. Thank goodness for that.
<user0> Oh that was so nice of them! I bet you were relieved!
<user1> I was, it saved me a lot of problems
<user0> I bet, losing your phone causes all kinds of stress!
<user0> Okay that's good to know. Hopefully you pass the test and I hope you studied. 
<user1> Oh I did, I have been doing it for weeks!
<user0> Very nice man. Let me know your exam results when they're released! 
<user0> Oh no! I'll bet that made you feel terrible!
<user1> I definitely did not feel appreciated
<user0> I can see why not! I'm so sorry that happened to you.
<user0> That is hilarious. I bet.
<user1> I was so awkward and quiet in school, how about yourself?
<user0> Oh my just the opposite LOL
<user1> So you were outgoing and popular, huh?
<user1> Oh wow! Congratulations! That is wonderful.
<user0> Thanks I'm stressed, excited and hopeful for the future. Do you have kids?
<user1> I do not yet but hope to one day. I think you will be a great parent! 
<user0> Thank you. We have been trying for a year. 
<user0> wow yes it is 
<user1> I couldn't believe it. Just the day before we were crushing cheese steaks.
<user0> He probably stored that up for his energy for the race
<user1> I guess, I;m sure he eat again after that. He loves food. If he can do it I know I can run one.
<user1> Haha oh wow, how was that for them
<user0> she did well actually, i was impressed with how well she managed to do despite lack of sleep!
<user1> Thats great, im glad she did well
<user1> I hate it when that happens! were you ok?
<user0> I made it out ok, just so irritating
<user1> I always wonder what goes through peoples heads when that happens.
<user1> That sounds nice! DId you have fun
<user0> It was great, felt refreshing to be around them
<user1> I'm glad you enjoyed yourself, it is important to make time for family.
<user1> I'm sorry to hear you're having to deal with that
<user0> Yeah, it can get annoying at times. I just stir clear of him when he is around. 
<user1> Sounds like the best thing to do honestly
<user1> you will survive, and you have something to look forward to
<user0> exactly, it's keeping me going since i'm not feeling to good today!
<user1> i hope your work day goes by fast
<user1> Oh wow that is so scary.  I can't believe he asked someone so young to do that.
<user0> Well, he was 17 at the time, so in his defense, he just was being a "dumb teenager". My parents never let me go with him again after that though. 
<user1> I really hope you didn't have any lasting effects from the injury?
<user1> Wow! I'm sorry to hear that. Do you think you will get an A this time?
<user0>  I do actually! 
<user1> Congratulations! Studying can be hard, but sometimes it's about technique rather than time spent. Are you doing anything different this time?
<user1> Oh no! I'm so sorry! I hate when that happens!
<user0> Yes, I have a staff of 30 and I think each one saw me at some point in the day. I have Khaki's on. I had to tape and staple the hole. 
<user1> Ugh! That's the worst! Too bad you couldn't run home and change!
<user0> That would have been nice. But home is an hour each way. 
<user0> Oh that sounds so scary!
<user1> It was very scary, i'm terrified of spiders. What are you afraid of?
<user0> I hate snakes! They are like little evil creatures.
<user0> Don't even tlak about diets.I miss the times i was young and could eat all i wanted
<user1> yea but those times are behind us. Tonight for dinner was a Kale salad. It was gross but I've gotten a dish or rocky road with my name on it later. I do feel bad for lying to her but I need it.
<user0> Ugh.So boring.What wrong with being fat.At least they are all happy.
<user1> I think I'm average. I'm 5'11" 190. It could be worse. I still exercise a lot. Perhaps I need to enjoy the ice cream more and try to feel less guilty.  
<user1> Yes, I have an Associate's in Nursing.
<user0> Wow that's great you must enjoy helping others! 
<user1> Yes, it's been a great career.  How exciting for you to be about yours.  Congratulations!
<user1> Holy smokes! Let me guess, better for the environment?
<user0> yes but in the end it's still paper and still going to the same place. I dream of the day I can enjoy Angel Soft or Charmin again.
<user1> You poor soul! I'm all for saving the planet, but you have to draw the line somewhere. I hope you get some relief!
<user0> I'm going to have to start waiting until I go to work to use the potty.
<user0> But that is an awesome grade!  You should be so proud!!!
<user1> Thank you, I am definitely proud! When was your last exam?
<user0> Oh, it's been years since I've taken an exam!  Perhaps the last one was a para-pro exam to help out in the local schools when my kids were younger - but they didn't even give me the grade - it was a pass/fail type exam (the horror of not knowing the grade though!!)
<user0> I love the Autobahn.
<user1> I've been faster in my old Audi but this little car is a 4 cylinder and still super fast.
<user0> Yes I use to own an Audio.
<user1> Awesome, it's time to buy another.
<user1> I have never done that, good job.
<user0> That's it was a bucket list item and the hardest thing I have ever done but now I want to do it again.
<user1> You should. When is the next one.
<user0> This fall. I'm need to train more. It was a 26 mile running race, 10 mile swim and the rest on bikes. So much fun!
<user0> Oh wow thats cool.
<user1> Yes, he's been gone 10 years but I still think of him daily. It's strange how someone can make such an impact on someone for so long. 
<user0> Thats good you still think of him.
<user1> Yes, he was my hero and still is I guess. 
<user1> Thats cool. Was it hard?
<user0> Some of it was. I had to learn the name, attachment point, and action of every muscle in the body. There are over 800. 
<user1> Wow that is a lot.
<user1> What do you get from your mom?
<user0> Being bothered by uninvited guests
<user1> I don't like uninvited guests either! So annoying!
<user0> Some people think it's ridiculous to have a problem with that, but I adore my privacy and space.
<user0> I love dalmatians.
<user1> She was a great dog! That game felt so so long though. I had to watch her sitting with my parents while I played. 
<user0> How old was she.
<user1> 6 weeks when we got her. 
<user1> Well maybe it is but it could also just be she's spoiled.
<user0> I didn't know her when she was young, so she could be. I think she just likes to be miserable. 
<user1> Does she have like some other issues like mentally?
<user0> I wouldn't be surprised. 
<user0> I have a pair of fuzzy slippers that make me feel pretty cozy and happy in.
<user1> yea, I had that but recently my shoes wore out and they no longer make them. I'm so sad!
<user0> That is the worse, you finally find a brand and fit that perfect and they discontinue making them that is the worst, happens to me all the time.
<user1> Yes, I was angry and sad.
<user0> So did you end up finding a shoe that you could live with and that was close to the ones you had, or have you been unsuccessful?
<user1> nope, I gave up on shoes all together. 
<user1> Wow, did they notice?
<user0> yep, to make it worse I'm the boss. I'm pregnant so I tried to pass it off like the baby was pressing on my bladder. 
<user1> They will forget about it soon.
<user0> The next day someone had put a diaper in my desk.
<user0> I am so sorry to hear that. What did they do to make you feel uncomfortable going there?
<user1> They were a friend and customer of mine in a small business and cheated me out of a large sum of money.
<user0> That's the worst! You think you can trust people, and then they stab you in the back. I don't blame you for not wanting to see them again.
<user0> That is great. That should be good insurance. Are you generaly happy with it?
<user1> Yes, they are covering $4,500 worth of work. I only have to pay $100 total. I can't wait to have good teeth. 
<user0> That is nice. Good luck with the sugery.
<user1> Thanks, I'm a little scared but it will be worth it. Being from the UK bad teeth are in my genes.
<user1> I love Colorado, my favorite state.
<user0> Yes me two. I used to live in Colorado. I have not been up a mountain that big in years, I'm getting the belly butterfly's. 
<user1> I wish I could live there.
<user0> It was a great place to live but very expensive and winter was rough.
<user0> Did you fart?
<user1> It sounded like trumpets were filling the room. He looked like he wanted to puke each and ever time. 
<user0> Did they smell?
<user1> Have you ever drove past a cow farm or garage dump? Yes, well those smell better then I did that night. 
<user1> Did anyone get hurt?
<user0> No, thank goodness. Just a lot of car and property damage in the area. 
<user1> Thats good, as long as no one got hurt.
<user1> No training at all!  Wow, that's pretty impressive.  How far is a marathon?
<user0> 26.2 miles. He walks about 10 miles a day at work so that's some training sorta.
<user1> That's still pretty impressive.  I bet he was proud of himself also!  Does he plan to do it again and will you maybe do it with him?
<user0> He wants to do an Iron Man. 126.2 miles, running, biking and swimming.
<user1> WOW - he certainly is adventurous and determined.  I bet he will do amazing.
<user0> Yes, I'm well impressed with him. 
<user0> Wow you are brave.
<user1> Yes, it was only a fleeting moment but it was there. 
<user0> I bet you drove fast.
<user0> Oh my! That sounds exciting for sure! I couldn't do it, I don't think.
<user1> Yea, until this morning when I called and put down a deposit I did not think I could either.
<user0> Have you ever done anything else so frightening?
<user1> Yes, I love doing something crazy and the feeling I get from it. 
<user0> I would say that you're an adventurous person. Me, I'm more laid back and mellow. Kudos to you and have fun!
<user1> That's i'm so scared but it will be worth it. You only have one life so don't hold back.
<user1> At least you did it. Lance Armstrong did not learn until he was 13.
<user0> Really? I didn't know that. Is there anything that you'd say you were a late bloomer for?
<user1> Love, it took me 12 years with the same person to build up the courage to ask her to marry me. 
<user0> Well congratulations for taking your time, look at it that way.
<user1> yes not if I can just calm the nerves for this skydiving trip.
<user0> Maybe try controlled breathing exercises, I'm sure you'll be fine and want to do it again.
<user1> Hope so. I don't do well with heights.
<user1> Oh, I bet that was very stressful and difficult. I hope you did well on it?
<user0> Yeah because the professor got mad that the book store didn't have the little blue books to write in, so he canceled it and said whatever our current grade was to bump it up a letter grade
<user1> Well, at least you didn't go down in your grade. But, it wasn't right to treat the students like that!
<user1> That is good, how old are you?
<user0> 33 so not super old or super young. Just happy with who I am.
<user1> I am 31 so same generation.
<user0> Have you stopped caring yet? About others opinions? 
<user0> Oh gosh, I am sorry. Did you let the pizza place know? 
<user1> Yes, I called and they laughed at me. Told me it was the new pizza buy and that he must have used old cheese or something. 
<user0> Wow! In that instance, I would prefer them to lie to me than to laugh and be like I knowingly fed you bad food. 
<user1> Yes, for the first 12 hours I just had to lay in the bathroom floor in pain.
<user1> and did you knock it out of the park? 
<user0> Uh, I made a B on it,  so it was a false sense of confidence, lol
<user1> Perhaps be less cocky next time? Either way B's get degree's. 
<user1> Was he okay? I've never heard of that going wrong.
<user0> Yeah, he was fine, but I had read a few horror stories online. I knew I shouldn't, but I did. 
<user1> That's where you went wrong lol. I'm glad he was fine. I would've been scared if it were one of my kids too. Surgery is still surgery.
<user1> Oh, I bet that could be frightening for your dogs. Did you try to complain to them?
<user0> We don't know them well, but if they do it again tonight we probably will. I understand on the 4th and even a couple of days after, but some people have to get up for work. 
<user1> I think they have some leftover fireworks that they don't want to sit on. They should just use them next time.
<user1> it takes a strong and compassionate person to make that kind of decision.
<user0> It was very hard, but she was suffering. Our vet was very helpful and we did ask him if he thought it was too soon. He assured us that it was not. 
<user1> She had a happy life. I'm sure she understands.
<user1> Sounds nice. How long has it been since you've seen her?
<user0> About seven months. Too long. 
<user1> Oh wow. That is a long time. Do you live far apart?
<user0> Yes, about a 17 hour drive. 
<user0> That's awesome! What did they talk about?
<user1> He was a retired FBI agent who talked about his experiences in the field in the 1970's.
<user0> Fascinating! What kind of work do you do?
<user1> I'm a role player that trains law enforcement by acting as victims or suspects.
<user0> Sounds like it was very exciting!
<user1> Yeah he talked about his toughest cases and some funny storties about suspects who incriminated themselves with simple linguistic tricks.
<user1> Me too! I also Iike staying home all day.
<user0> I wonder what will happen this season. I'm expecting it to be really nail biting. 
<user1> I have more time to watch movies and shows on netflix alot. I stay home with my little one year old during the day.
<user1> I hate when that happens!  I look forward to those all day you know!  Did you find out who the culprit was?
<user0> Yes, it was my partner. He owes me big time
<user1> I think that calls for a nice steak dinner out - on his dime!
<user0> Right! He says i'm greedy anyway, but that's besides the point!
<user0> It happens to everyone, are you out of it now?
<user1> yeah but what I did was terrible. I was self employed and I manipulated the system so I received money I was not owed/. My husband helped me out of the jam once I came clean about aht I did.
<user0> Oh well, it was nice to have someone to help you.
<user0> I don't like them at all. I've seen too many videos on the internet where people get injured or they break easily
<user1> Yes, I remember in 2007 a teen was decapitated at Six Flags in Atlanta.
<user0> Yeah that is terrifying. The smaller country fairs are worse. I bet they have no one really checking up on them except the carney folk.
<user1> I just don't think they're safe enough, many rides at the small carnivals are rickety and wobbly.
<user0> yeah, and the people in charge don't get paid enough to always check up and repair them
<user1> I'll just stick to the food and go home. Funnel Cakes and Polish Sausages are my favs.
<user1> I bet you were, I did that to my husband when I was young. I thought it was the solution to relief from abuse.
<user0> I know it was a horrible experience at the time, now I think its the greatest thing to ever happen to me. Sleeping in different beds for 3 years isn't healthy. It took that to wake me up
<user1> I guess that was what you call a temporary situation. Sometimes moving on is required.
<user1> Don't you wish you knew you were living in the good ol days while your going through them
<user0> That's nothing but the truth! What's your favorite era?
<user1> Don't you wish you knew you were living in the good ol days while your going through them
<user0> Do you have a favorite era?
<user1> Probably the mid to late 90s. This is going to be hilarious but my one memory from that era is when I first heard Brittany Spears hit me baby one more time song. It changed my life
<user1> Sure I did! It takes determation to succeed
<user0> I didn't think I woudl have to do that much studying. I figured that came later in college. 
<user1> So if not by studying ,what else?
<user1> That must have hurt a lot.Did you go to the hospital? 
<user0> No, I don't have insurance. Just like when I twisted my ankle on the stairs and fell. It took months to heal, but it healed.
<user1> You are very accident prone.You should get an insurance right away.
<user0> That's hilarious! I can't afford it right now though. I'll just be more careful.
<user0> That is so true. And sometimes that phone call can be a trip of a life time!
<user1> My phone call was my mom telling me my 32 year old had just died of a heart attack while at her house.
<user0> Oh my goodness! Once things settle down I will give you the info about our cruise. It will help you relax like it did me!
<user0> Sounds so exciting. What did he plan?
<user1> We are going to Mexico. I have mixed feelings, but mostly excited!
<user0> When and how? Are you flying or driving? Just because or is it your anniversary?
<user1> It's our 10th anniversary. We are making the drive to FL since we live in Georgia. 
<user1> That's too funny. You know, I'm the exact same way.. I get so nostalgic with my old things. Can never throw them away!
<user0> I know! I am always like I need this notebook that has my 3rd grade handwriting back from the 90s because it will be very useful someday... lol
<user1> Yes, someday... Haha. I love looking back at those kinds of things. It brings back so many good memories. Such a good feeling
<user1> I'm sorry to hear that. Were you two very close?
<user0> Yes, we were. I used to spend my summer vacations with her when my parents were out of town, so it allowed me to get really close with her.
<user1> That's sweet, I had the same experience with my own grandma too. God bless y'all!
<user1> Wow, that must have been challenging for everyone! Was he okay ultimately? Was someone able to help him?
<user0> They couldn't capture him, he jumped the fence by the pool and rolled down a hill. I don't know what happened to him.
<user1> That IS frightening! Hopefully nothing you'll have to deal with again!
<user0> I hope not! I'm not good with crisis situations at all!
<user0> What was the initial talk?
<user1> I should descript how I could feel when am lonely
<user0> So how do you feel when lonely?
<user1> Wow, the situation is always very bad
<user1> Maybe she does not have the hots for you anymore.
<user0> It is funny how you can be going through life thinking everything is great, and then one day you find a nude of another dude that isn't you on your wife's computer. Makes for a wonderful day!
<user1> yes, i understood the first time.
<user0> Oh, sorry, I meant to say Ex-wife. I am so glad she didn't. The years haven't be kind to her, so got out just at the right time, lol
<user0> I know the feeling. Once I fell in high school from a puddle and laughed it off even though I was hurt,
<user1> Even animals get embarrassed, I've seen it in my cats.
<user0> Oh really? I haven't seen that in an animal as of yet. That's pretty interesting.
<user1> Yes, my cat fell from the mantle above the fireplace and looked totally embarrassed.
<user0> Oh dang, talk about a fall! If I were your cat I'd be embarrassed too! Lol
<user0> That is a hilarious intro, thank you for that! So were you worried that your girlfriend found someone else humorous? (And you're very insightful + intelligent if you say yes! Though being both of those things, you have nothing to worry about ;-))
<user1> Well, I most def want to be insightful and intelligent, so I will say YES. I know I had nothing to worry about, but it is crazy how in those instances when you least expect it a ridiculous meme shots into your brain and you start playing "Along Came Polly" sceneros in your head. 
<user0> These references are perfect. And your girlfriend must enjoy you very much. Mazel tov, you crazy kids!
<user0> Is that good or bad? Why the concern?
<user1> I think it is bad
<user0> OK why do you think so?
<user1> Boys are meant to be playing with car toys not dolls.
<user1> Indeed. It makes you feel good when you can help somebody else with their problem
<user0> It also makes me feel bad when i'm unable to help.
<user1> I think if everybody in the world offered a hand of help to one another, we would not have much problem
<user0> That is so true! There is no reason for there to be a problem with famine in the world.
<user0> Well you should try to study more and see what happens
<user1> I did, I can't remember, I either made an A or a B in there.
<user0> Well maybe you should talk about getting a tutor or somethinf
<user0> THAT IS TERRIFYING. Until the end of your story.. then I laughed so hard I cried. But that is so relatable. I've been terrified of my own shadow more than once.
<user1> It seems to happen to me at least once a week. If I watch a scary movie or show then it happens at least every other day until I forget about it, lol
<user0> That's hilarious, But I also feel bad for you. Perhaps there is a way to calm yourself down after you watch a scary movie?
<user1> I have gotten better. I don't have to sleep in my parents bed anymore. Granted, I am 32 now, lol
<user0> Haha hey I would sneak into my parents bed even as a teenager when I was scared, especially during storms.
<user0> I'm supposed to wait for you to start. :) 
<user1> Is my response not good enough?
<user0> You haven't said anything yet other than asking why I hadn't responded. Sorry I'm a little lost as to what I was supposed to respond to?
<user1> Se
<user1> Really?  Where do you live at?
<user0> Alabama. It's winter for about 2 weeks.
<user1> I feel your pain.  I live in Orlando, Florida.  So Im in the same boat.
<user1> That is so annoying.Who he thinks he is???
<user0> I dunno, but I just said "That's great, bro" and left.  Then he follows me to the checkout counter to continue giving me crap about it.
<user1> I would be scared of a guy like that.
<user0> Well I just got incensed with him and told the clerk to do something about him or I'm not shopping there anymore.  He was told to leave.
<user0> Aww... sorry to hear that. I haven't personally seen the show. What hit you the most?
<user1> Oh, it was a movie about a woman who lost her memory, and her husband had to get her to fall back in love with him. At the time, I was like I want that; however, now that I am in a relationship, I am like I don't know about this. I wish she would get amnesia as well
<user0> Sounds like a touching but sad story. Love without two ways interaction is really hard. I can't imagine myself going through relationship like this honestly..
<user0> You mean nostalgic?
<user1> I guess I am nostalgic now.
<user0> What your grand father did to you was very special.
<user1> He read a tract to me. He explained God's love for me with pictures in a way I could understand.
<user1> That is not very considerate or respectful, plus the dog could get hurt if a vehicle were traveling down the street.
<user0> That's what i'm afraid of as well! But the dog seems to only want to use it that way. Do you like your neighbors?
<user1> I live in the country, so I do not have neighbors that live close. 
<user0> How fortunate, my grandparents lived in the country. I would always be scared at night thinking of their scary stories. 
<user1> I sometimes get freaked out, but getting freaked out every now and then is better than having to deal with neighbors. 
<user0> That's true. You can live in peace.
<user1> Yes. Peace is key.
<user1> Uhmmnn! Cut down on the intake 
<user0> I quit. Probably going to need some fillings.
<user1> You need to see a dentist then
<user1> Just all the time.Who does not?
<user0> Yeah right now I dont know how to make a game install on another drive. Do you?
<user1> It depends on the machine you are working on.
<user1> Do you have a tribal tattoo. How does it look like?
<user0> I got it when I was 18. I didn't take care of it, so now it looks like a shady prison tattoo, lol
<user1> That was bad. You can try some tattoo removal tool
<user1> Did you know them well? You must be very trusting.
<user0> A co-worker at work needed some money for a drink, but I didnt have any cash, so I let them have my debit card to go buy them something
<user1> I think I would have just said I didn't have any cash and let that be the end of it.
<user0> Not really. The individual kind of seemed shady as well, but my debit card has a feature that allows me to turn it off
<user0> Sorry! Try harder next time!
<user1> Yeah, i know,i ought to have taken my studies seriously.
<user0> Never late you know!
<user0> That sucks. Are they mad or what?
<user1> Sucks? I don't know about sucks.
<user0> It's kinda annoying to me when people don't call you back.
<user0> Serious? Why are you scared when you are in a wreck?
<user1> I was on an overpass and didn't want to fall off.
<user0> Wow, you really have to be careful dear.
<user0> Yes I have, it feels really bad when it happens.
<user1> Yeah same. Sometimes I can make a fool of myself by trying to act too smart or something like that.
<user0> Yea it can be quite embarrassing to look back on.
<user0> Come on, you do not have to be jealous of your brother
<user1> I can't handle that very well. I need to get my groove and swag on. Damn it!
<user0> You can learnt some skills from your brother. Maybe it will help
<user0> Are you trying to go out and meet some ladies 
<user1> Yeah, i'm so ready to date.I want to meet my person.
<user0> That is the first step. What you have to do next is be at your best behavior always 
<user0> Do you work in the tech industry? You could always take a class.
<user1> That's true. There's a lot of stuff online. No I'm completing college for a natural sciences degree lol.
<user0> There's ton's online, and knowing more about computers can really help any profession.
<user0> I am sure it is something disgusting. Do you have someone do it around you
<user1> Yeah, i close friend of mine likes doing that. she has to stop.
<user0> You can just let him know you are not comfortable with it
<user0> yes the patient is very ill
<user1> It was cool cause her dad died of cancer, so now she is helping sick people.
<user0> oh that is really a bad news i heared
<user0> What is it that you would like to share with me? I am very interested to hear about it!
<user1> I am excited I bought a lottery ticket today and the jackpot is over 20 million 
<user0> Whoa, I hope you win! You never know, it could be your lucky day!
<user1> Yes, you never know I was talking to a co-worker today and she won $2500 last year at this time 
<user1> I know how you feel, I get so scared when exams come up, its so hard sometimes
<user0> Open book exams can be tricky, i have no option but to pass this exam.
<user1> Yea open book make you think you dont need to study but that isnt true at all
<user1> Hi
<user0> i just got my bachelors degree in english with a gap of 3.5
<user1> Cool, I could not do English.
<user0> yea it was really tough but i finally did it. 4 years strong lol 
<user0> yea that does seem like a lot of work could you ever handle it?
<user1> Maybe. Some of them he got from a guy who retired though.
<user0> ooo well that explains a lot. well hopefully he will pass some to you 
<user0> Which work are you talking about. it is always a good feeling to get things done. There a way your brain reward you with good feeling 
<user1> It was just some stuff for a new job. Do you feel happy to complete stuff?
<user0> Oh yes, i do most times. Who does not
<user0> I say think of all the places you always wanted to go and then choose a place you never even considered.
<user1> That is interesting but I usually look for deals so I can go to more places
<user0> Yes deals will allow you to travel more for sure.
<user1> Yes, they also do take me to places I wouldn't think of going until I see the deal 
<user1> Do you think you can win the lottery 
<user0> hahaha no I don't at all but I was just really hoping that it would happen on the off chance.
<user1> Then why do you want to risk your money on such thing. Why not buy yourself a nice shoe instead 
<user0> well thats very true I guess since the ticket is only 2 bucks I figure what the heck 
<user0> I am very glad to hear that. Do you have any children?
<user1> I have three beautiful kids and you?
<user0> I have no kids, but would love to have some at some point!
<user0> yes i do
<user1> What do you feel hopeful about?
<user0> i feel hopeful that i am going to recover from a mental dosirder
<user0> That sounds terrible. Why didn't he come?
<user1> he said he was held up at work and coud not make it
<user0> Ah I see. I don't really talk to my brother much.
<user1> why is that so?
<user1> That seems pleasant. I am currently in my chair working!
<user0> I am getting ready to go to bed I am in my pyjamas 
<user1> I need some good rest, myself. Sleep is so important!
<user0> Yes it is but I always have a hard time getting off the couch to go to bed sometimes I just fall asleep on the couch.
<user0> Awesome!  Thats exciting.  What college are you applying at?
<user1> i'm applying to my local college its called samford 
<user0> Thats awesome!  I wish you the best of luck in your future studies!
<user1> thank you very much i am defintely hoping for the best
<user1> What is so interesting about the series
<user0> Probably mostly the super heroes in it.
<user1> I see. Are you excited about seeing the movie
<user1> congratulations on getting your job we should go celebrate !
<user0> Oh yes we should let's go have some cake and ice cream.
<user1> as long as the cake is funfetti i am more than there 
<user1> Wow, are they going to pay for it?
<user0> yea they are they said since I graduated top of my class that they are going to cover it !
<user1> You have some very nice parents, when I graduated my parents said pay us more rent now. 
<user0> hahaha that is funny but in a very bad way.
<user0> Thats a really good idea, that sounds like it would be hard to sleep though
<user1> Yes, surgery is so scary. But i'm glad it's over.
<user0> Im glad it turned out well or i hope so.
<user0> As it should.  However those things happen to everyone it is a part of life.
<user1> As sad as it may sound,that is the reality which we cant escape.
<user0> Hopefully something better happens when we die and our lives will go on in a better way.
<user0> I'm glad you enjoyed it. Was it a wedding?
<user1> it was a wedding shower
<user0> That's wonderful. I am going to a wedding next week!
<user1> awwwww, thats great. hope you enjoy it
<user1> I understand. I remember when we had to save games to 5 inch floppy disks. They made really strange shuffling sounds and a lot of times didn't even read.
<user0> Those are old from what I understand. This was a while ago?
<user1> Yeah, I had my Commodore 64 and Amiga in the late 80's. Still, the games were great when they worked!
<user1> How wonderful. What sort of dog?
<user0> it is a west highland terrier and he is so cute !
<user1> A fluffy white one? How amazing!
<user0> yea a fluffy white one and the kids love him
<user1> How old is he?
<user1> That sounds amazing! What do you think you're gonna do there?
<user0> Go shopping and eat, I love food and Vegas has some amazing food. 
<user1> I've been one time but I was too young to drink or gamble so it was a little boring. That sounds like a great time though, I'm happy for you!
<user0> Ya I have actually been a few times but it is still fun to go with your friends
<user0> That's unfortunate. Some people just cannot help but act rude.
<user1> yes, and i ended up getting a different taxi, i lost my money
<user0> That's unfortunate. What do you think about Uber?
<user1> it is reliable and efficient, i wish i had taken one that day
<user1> That is a tough thing to deal with but hopefully his first F will also be his last.
<user0> yea he is a smart kid I just think he has been playing too much fortnite.
<user1> Fornite has surely caused many kids grades to drop.
<user1> That was so bad. What kill the diver 
<user0> They said he ran out of oxygen, while uderwater. That was weird since it happened after they located the team.
<user1> It means he miscalculated the time he was to spend under the water. Sorry for him
<user1> Why did u leave your luggage for a stranger
<user0> That was so naive on my part, i had to leave shortly to buy a drink from the shop.
<user1> Wao,its a mistake,
<user1> That's intense. I hope you do as well as possible!
<user0> Thank you me too I have been studying like crazy. 
<user1> Keep up the great work. Pass that exam with flying colors.
<user1> Yeah, sometimes I want to just stop going to work. I hate TPS reports so much!
<user0> Like the ones from Office space? haha
<user1> Yeah, Bill Lumbergh is the worst boss ever. He kept calling me every day when I just wanted to sleep instead of work!
<user1> i love cats, just hold it between your arms, it will be okay
<user0> yea she finally decided to settle down so i think I can type good now.
<user1> thats better, but sorry for the disappointment she had caused
<user1> wow that is amazing I went there back in 2000. You are in for a big treat. Make sure to get french bread.
<user0> yah, french bread is on my list, will definitely do it
<user1> Also the mcdonald's taste way better there than in the US if your looking for good cheap food. 
<user0> i will have every taste for whatever i come across
<user0> You need to be patient. Getting promoted at your work place takes patience and perseverance 
<user1> I have a good chance though it is a very small department 
<user0> Your hopes are high. It means you have a good chance of getting it. And i hope you have the requirement too? 
<user0> Wow! It looks great that you feel achieved
<user1> The most outstanding achievement is when i was able to graduate with my Doctoral degree by the age of 30 years.
<user0> Congrats Doctor!! your parents would have been proud of you
<user0> Sorry to hear that you did not get approved.
<user1> It's ok, a car is another bill for me anyway. I'll keep taking Lyft.
<user0> You are right about that. Owning a car can get expensive.
<user1> What's your dream car?
<user0> My dream car is a Chevy Camaro.
<user1> That's a nice retro car, which year?
<user0> Classic 1975 would be great.
<user0> Do you still have them?
<user1> No, this was as a kid. The dog essentially killed one. Then the other one became more grumpy.
<user0> Do you own any other pets now?
<user0> Wow.  Did you get hurt?  Sounds scary.
<user1> No just the airbags went off and I hit my head and got a few bruises. 
<user0> I am always scared about those airbags!  I am so glad you are ok!
<user1> Thank you very much !
<user1> Oh my goodness, that's horrible. Who was she?
<user0> she was my cousin
<user1> That's horrible, I hope you are okay and are recovering from that.
<user0> i am okay now. may she rest in peace
<user0> No,i don't feel surprise d
<user1> You must be very talented then?
<user0> Yes,i am
<user0> I'm glad too. What made it swell up anyway?
<user1> Maybe not cleaning teeth properly, it was around a wisdom teeth that needs to come out or some work.
<user0> Oh I get that, I had that happen near one of my wisdom teeth too.
<user0> Wow, it was because you were young, that is why
<user1> Back then, I felt like the world owed me something because of my bad childhood.
<user0> It is really nothing, children behave like that sometimes
<user1> You're right, we live and learn. Or at least we should.
<user1> What did you pass?
<user0> My university result, when in school
<user1> That's great! I bet you feel relieved.
<user1> i am so happy for you. I know how it feel when you are stranded 
<user0> yes. i was so relieved, thanks to her
<user1> You can collect her contact and make friend with her
<user0> i did, i will be having lunch with her over the weekend
<user0> I didn't understand you
<user1> I feel extremely terrible i did not invite my best friend to my wedding
<user0> That is bad. How could you forget?
<user0> I only have a couple really good friends who are always there for me. The rest of my friends don't really care about me that much.
<user1> I feel the same way. Maybe it's normal?
<user0> Yeah, we have to watch out for ourselves. At least we won't let us down, lol.
<user0> That's great news to hear. I hope things continue to stay great for you.
<user1> Of course, it is good not to lose yourself when things are difficult
<user0> I agree. I think that difficult times are best navigated with a calm mind.
<user0> I hope it doesn't rain. Where are you going?
<user1> Panama City Beach, FL. I am really looking forward to the beach and resting in my suite.
<user0> That's great. I have been there before. It used to be a Spring Break hotspot.
<user1> Yes it did, I remember that. The saltwater always changes my hair color.
<user1> Oh no! That's not very nice but I guess you can play it off by just acting cool and laughing it off. 
<user0> i did but i feel so embarrassed 
<user1> It's okay it's pretty funny, and it'll be forgotten about so quick anyhow. I know how it feels haha, we all do.
<user0> yah, am over it now. actually the video was deleted
<user0> Oh ,really,that's so brave of him
<user1> Yeah, it might have just been an ROTC thing, but he did some traveling.
<user0> Ok,where did he travel to?
<user0> Yikes!  Schools get really mad about that, as well as it makes the kid worry.
<user1> Yes, she was crying and it made me cry. I felt so irresponsible.
<user0> Don't beat yourself up.  It happens all the time.  I am sure you are a loving parent!
<user1> Yes indeed, I am. She is 17 years old now.
<user1> That is awful. Was anyone else hurt?
<user0> no, just the child, she was trying to cross the road with her dog
<user1> Were there any signs that the driver might have been impared, as opposed to the breaks malfunctioning?
<user0> no, the driver was okay, the problem was with the breaks
<user1> I hope the child recovers from her injuries.
<user1> Oh wow, how did you feel about that? 
<user0> I wasn't sure how it could have happened given how fast they would have been going.
<user1> How fast were they going? 
<user1> Oh how nice, how long are you staying?
<user0> Just for a week.
<user1> That sounds exciting I hope you have a lot of fun!
<user1> That's refreshing to hear, I'm happy for you. I rarely hear that people are satisfied with their partner.
<user1> Wow, what really happened?
<user0> I ended up paying rent and bills ahead 2 months instead. 
<user1> Oh really, that was hectic for you I guess
<user0> It really was, and a missed opportunity to cut my costs.
<user0> You need to calm down and focus so that you can pass the exam
<user1> I am trying to
<user0> Do you get enough sleep. Being sleep deprived can make you lose focus 
<user0> what are you expecting? are you pregnant?
<user1> Nooo, I'm  not  pregnant, was just expecting my birthday gifts
<user0> oh nice well happy birthday
<user0> Were you up when he got home?
<user1> I was right at the door waiting for him,never been that scared.
<user0> I can understand your position. How old is he?
<user0> Is she a model?
<user1> No, she is a medical student, always wanted to be a doctor
<user0> Oh, so what does a "sitting" entail?
<user0> Who are you talking about? What happened?
<user1> Went for a music concert in New York and was expecting to see Beyonce but she didn't show up
<user0> That is bad. I hope you see her in another event.
<user0> Yea I know that feel, outside of a few people I knew nearly know one and avoided lots of people cause no one cared
<user1> Yes, and now that I've added them on Facebook, they still don't interact with me.
<user0> It can be really frustrating, seems like so many people have it good while so many have the short end of the stick
<user1> I know, That's why it's best to find your own happiness.
<user1> Yeah,but very few.
<user0> Why is that the case?
<user1> Most of my friend have had in the past just wanted to benefit from our relationship,it was not genuine.
<user1> That's great. I'm trying to get a girlfriend right now :/
<user0> I wish you luck buddy, most of these girls out here are so fake.
<user1> Yeah they are. It makes me sad too man.
<user1> Did you get a car as a gift? That's exciting.
<user0> yes, my mom bought for me as agift
<user1> That is so nice of her! That's really really generous. 
<user1> I think there must be a reason for that
<user0> I tried to ask but she refused to say anything. I guess she got a better guy
<user1> Oh,thats life,so sorry for that
<user1> What makes you say that?
<user0> I like making people around me happy.
<user1> Do you have  a large network of friends and family?
<user1> Somewhat, ive felt better these past couple months than i usually have
<user0> Me too. I think exercise helps ALOT.
<user1> Yes definitely, makes me feel like im doing soemthing good and helps me get better looking and healthier
<user1> What was bad about it?
<user0> My phone fell off the stairs, so I was expectant of getting a new one
<user1> Did you get a new phone?
<user1> Yes, it is important. What happened?
<user0> Nothing happened on my end, but my mate used to be a horrible cheater.
<user1> That is bad and difficult to live. Sorry to hear that.
<user1> I am so sorry to hear that, that is a real bummer. Were you injured?
<user0> Oh yes, I broke my ankle. It was really painful
<user1> That is absolutely awful! How long did it take for your ankle to heal?
<user1> wow, what did you do to deserve the car?
<user0> Not really, i was picked to be one of their lucky winners.
<user1> thats intresting, you must be very happy now
<user1> You should find something interesting to do.
<user0> like what
<user1> Go hand out with friends or host a night over sleep,that would be fun.
<user1> Who are you waiting for a response from?
<user0> Worker 2
<user1> I don't understand the context of this conversation.
<user1> Wow that's awesome! What kind of car did you get?
<user0> He got me a Honda car
<user1> Great to hear, they're really reliable good cars.
<user1> Oh really? thats sad, why is that?
<user0> I tripped over and fell down,and the students laughed at me.
<user1> oof that sounds quite embarrassing, hopefully it doesnt keep you down too long
<user1> A lot of the time. I'm quite an easily frightened person! Especially by large animals!
<user0> Yeah. I'm more scared of failing I guess
<user1> Have you always had a fear of falling?
<user1> Congratulations. How much did you win?
<user0> about 10 billion dollars, I cant wait to tell everyone and the internet and the world!
<user1> That's a lot of money. Can I have some of that?
<user1> Oh that sounds cool, where to?
<user0> Vermont, Denver, Baltimore, and Prince Edward Island.
<user1> Sounds like a lot of fun, I kinda wish I got to do those too back in high school.
<user1> You don't miss her?
<user0> I've missed her alot, have been calling her to come back home
<user1> I would suggest you go to china and visit her.
<user1> I was supporting England too,  
<user0> So bad, let wait for the finals.
<user1> Who do you think will win the cup
<user1> Yea but id still manage to leave something behind anyway haha.
<user0> For where? I did not, I was fully ready
<user1> Just anywhere like when leaving a friends place or taking stuff on a trip, i somehow manage to forget one small thing occasionally
<user1> What steps have you taken to remedy the situation and make her feel safe?
<user0> i apologized to her but still she wount talk to me
<user1> I think that's for the best. Abuse is never okay.
<user1> Im sorry im not sure i follow.
<user0> My neighbors were really annoying to an extent, so I was ready to face anyone that will be annoying again
<user1> Oh I see, i can imagine that can get really frustrating
<user1> How did that make you feel?
<user0> I felt so annoyed and devastated, because I was already late for the date
<user1> Oh no,trust me if it were me,she would hear me good!
<user1> Wow, but to have children in the house is good
<user0> Every time we add another child it feels great.
<user1> Oh yes...children are blessings, I love them being around me
<user1> Oh wow thats a big accomplishment, congrats.
<user0> i cant wait to start my classes
<user1> I feel the same, college is stressful but its a nice environment.
<user1> Why dont u throw the trash awy?
<user0> I should have.
<user1> Yea,as soon as possible
<user1> I'm so sorry. You feel so helpless when someone you love is ill.
<user0> Yea, I cried and cried... But I believe she will be OK soon
<user1> Oh, I'm so glad to hear that! I hope for her speedy recovery!
<user1> I cry everytime I watch dogs on TV, always makes me sad.
<user0> Like the animal dog?
<user1> Yes, I a, referring to the animal, dog.
<user1> which team are you supporting
<user0> I'm supporting France.
<user1> yeeees. I am alos supporting France. I hope it wins
<user1> Don't you worry,there is always a next time.
<user0> yah, i will go next time
<user1> Try visit Barbados,such an amazing place.
<user1> I'm sorry to hear that. That's an awful way to go.
<user0> Seriously it was heartbreaking because we were best of friends
<user1> Hopefully you're able to move on and be happy.
<user1> That is so annoying. What came up that he had to cancel?
<user0> He was doing something with his parents.
<user1> Did you manage to reschedule? 
<user1> That's really cool. What kind of dance do you do?
<user0> Break dance
<user1> That's awesome I've always wanted to learn.
<user1> Yeah mostly when I'm not expecting something new
<user0> I'm surprised I'm still awake haha.
<user1> Hahaha maybe you slept alot during the day
<user1> yes.my partner is very romantic person.
<user0> You much be very lucky. I need a companion,a girlfriend.
<user1> yes. I Of course you need a girlfriend and the girlfriend  is very lucky.stay blessed.
<user1> You are so welcomed!
<user0> yes.i am very lucky person so thought with you
<user1> Ok,sounds great!
<user1> About what?
<user0> Am surprised may be my response is not good enough.
<user1> You are funny.
<user1> Wow, you are lucky.
<user0> She came tops in her class and last year she read about 80 short story books.
<user1> That is good. Am really happy for her.
<user1> ok hope the sucessful in prayer.
<user0> yah sure
<user1> ok, next
<user1> Oh, wow. Was he stationed there? 
<user0> He just went to stay there with my uncle
<user1> What was it like in Japan, did you ask? 
<user1> Did you find your shoe in the end?
<user0> I later saw it inside my bag that I have already packed
<user1> Oh dear! That's quite a mess! Did you have to pay any fees to rebook the flight?
<user1> No. I feel fine, if a little tired. Do you?
<user0> Yeah me too. I kind of do due to lack of sleep. 
<user1> Are you based in the US? Is it not about 2 am over there?
<user1> Yea my mother has been a huge support to me over the years, how about you?
<user0> I feel that way about my dad. He helps me out a ton on almost everything.
<user1> Yea my dad was really cool but he was also a drunk sadly so he was flip floppy
<user1> What do you mean exactly?
<user0> I was so curious of being alone at home Cox I wanted to see a movie
<user1> Oh cool, well that sounds like a good time.
<user1> I hope you don't have work in the morning. Whenever I can't sleep easily I just give up trying and do something else.
<user0> i cant, i really want ti sleep
<user1> Do you know them we'll enough to ask them to stop?
<user1> Oh about what exactly? Are you talking about family or friend or SO?
<user0> I went out with my friends
<user1> Ah ok, was it fun then?
<user1> Oh yeah, I've been through quite a few sad things before. What about you?
<user0> Yeah some. It's a part of life I guess.
<user1> Definitely, the sad is needed to balance out the good.
<user1> I figure we'll all be there at some point once we get old.
<user0> i dont want to imagine
<user1> My parents worked in them, so I am used to them.
<user1> oooh, sorry about that, what happened
<user0> I was the last person to look after it when people were on vacation for about a week. I feel bad cause for a couple of those days I didn't crack the garage door.
<user1> sorry, i hope you areokay now
<user1> Where you the only one in the house?
<user0> Oh yes, I would have gone out with my best Friend but she went on a holiday
<user1> Wow, that's nice!
<user1> Wow, that's a big mess-up! How did that turn out?
<user0> I got my second best time at the distance after borrowing someone else's shoes.
<user1> Good thing you found someone who had as big of feet as you do!
<user1> Why? What was the unexpected thing that happened?
<user0> That he bought me a watch, not just a watch but gold
<user1> Who bought you this golden watch? Was it a wizard?
<user1> Oh? Is it more of art than purpose in its form? 
<user0> It's more like there were leftover parts and we made do with what we had.
<user1> Oh, I see. A workable shelf then. 
<user1> Hahaha hope you did very well
<user0> Of course, very excellent result
<user1> That's good....  I did well too
<user1> So, did you get it?
<user0> Noo, but hopefully I will get it this week
<user1> That is cool. Definitely you will
<user1> Wow, and you didn't get pulled over?
<user0> No, I had not tried to max it out. But at 95 it pretty much shook and wouldn't go faster.
<user1> Must've been some important meeting!
<user1> I don't know what flogging is.
<user0> Wow, I mean I was disciplined
<user1> Looking up the definition tells me its punishment by being whipped or beaten, so unless you mean you were beaten metaphorically, you shouldn't be "wowing" me.
<user1> Well done, what type of performance was it?
<user0> Dance performance 
<user1> Was it a ballet. I enjoy watching dance performances.
<user1> What did she surprise you with?
<user0> By helping me with my chores, even without me asking
<user1> amazing! Thats really nice
<user1> What do u want to eat?
<user0> Noodles I guess
<user1> Ok,have u prepared it?
<user1> normal is the best way, it helps the mother bond with the child
<user0> Exactly, and it helps the woman heal fast.
<user1> we are adamant to have our baby born normal. I have seen first hand the CS mothers and their closeness (lack of) with their kids
<user1> You think so? 
<user0> Yeah Cox I've been in that situation before
<user1> Well, I've kept quite a few relationships throughout my life. If I actually wanted to look at online profiles, I do it mostly for research or investigative purposes. Other than that, I'm only interested in online chat. 
<user1> Why, what do you have planned?
<user0> Wanted to go see a movie with my girlfriend 
<user1> Sounds like fun!  I hope you find the money to do it.
<user1> Great! you must be well prepared. Are you nervous?
<user0> No actually I was feeling very positive as I had done so much research.  During the interview I was able to answer the questions with ease and my courage just grew and grew.  I left feeling on top of the world as it had gone so well!
<user1> Yes it sounds like you did everything right.  I hope you hear back from them soon about a job offer.
<user0> I just did and I got the job! I think I will be going on for a celebration tonight.
<user0> did you get what you needed?
<user1> Nooo but I got a little
<user0> well that's better than nothing at all :)
<user0> Oh no, I've had a few days like that. Did you laugh it off?
<user1> Not really I was just mortified!! One shoe was plain black and the other had a pink bow on it at the front.  I had to walk about all day while the whole office couldnt stop laughing.  I think by the end of the day though I tried to see the funny side.
<user0> Well good on you for toughing it out. Your the stronger for it.
<user1> lol i dont know about that but I have definitely learnt to always have one last check of what Im wearing before I ever leave the house again!!
<user1> what kin of food was it?
<user0> Pasta food. I felt bad
<user1> I love pasta
<user1> Wow that must feel good
<user0> Very cool, I felt on top of the world
<user1> that is great
<user1> how nice
<user0> Very good one, gold watch
<user1> wow that is very nice
<user1> that sucks. Sometimes it doesn't matter if you're surrounded by people, you can still feel alone
<user0> Yeah most especially when you have no friend around
<user1> the hardest lesson in life is that we're all alone
<user1> Awesome. What type of music was played there?
<user0> Hip pop  mostly,  they invited Beyonce but she didn't show up 
<user1> oh my God. that's so cool. Hope the ticket was not expensive?
<user1> Who came back with a gold medal? 
<user0> My friend, he won the 100 metre sprint carnival.
<user1> Oh, nice. Well, if you work upon on something, anything is possible if you work upon it. 
<user1> Hello friend! May I ask what it that you feel that way about?
<user0> It encourage to be impressed.
<user1> I don't understand what you are talking about. Are you feeling okay today?
<user1> of course, like they say happiness is contagious, if you are happy everything around you stays happy and it will be hard to die young
<user0> Yeah for sure, that's why I always like to be happy 
<user1> Also your home stays blessed because you become a more better partner
<user1> Wow that must be lot of preparation 
<user0> It was, but part of the fun was getting ready!  Sometimes the planning can be just as fun as the event!
<user1> Where is this event going to be
<user1> That's amazing. It's good to give your head a rest so that you will recall all the items easily when you are at the exam center
<user0> Thanks, I think I have learnt everything because redid each past exam paper 10 times.
<user1> I wish you all the best in the Exam
<user1> Thats good, I am not sure if I can ask what happened? 
<user0> I'm glad you did!  I had a tumor removed, and it was NOT cancerous!
<user1> Oh wow, I am glad that you are okay.
<user1> Omg I would have ran faster than forest gump... what did you do? 
<user0> I ran inside and got my husband out of bed. He killed it since we have little kids we didn't want to take a risk that it was poisonous. 
<user1> Im glad no one was hurt! 
<user1> Oh no, I'm sure that was a hard memory to have brought up for you. 
<user0> It was, she was a very special dog. One of the old souls with a heart of gold. I still miss her.
<user1> What was her name? Have you read Rainbow Bridge?
<user0> Yes, It is a beautiful poem! Her name was Skyber. 
<user1> What a beautiful name! Hopefully your memories are more happy than sad now.
<user1> That's great. Teachers are so important.
<user0> It's such a fulfilling job. The test was difficult, but I spent a lot of my free time studying for it.
<user1> I wanted to become a teacher before. I was afraid of how hard it would be.
<user0> It's a lot of work, but if you really put in the effort, it becomes much easier.
<user1> Well congratulations! I hope your students appreciate you as much as they should.
<user1> Oh my goodness, did you go to check what the noise was?
<user0> I did, it turned out to be my cat playing with a play mat the kids left out. 
<user1> I'm glad it wasn't anything serious! It's scary how quick our mind goes to the worst possible scenarios.
<user1> That's really cool of them. You weren't expecting it at all, hu?
<user0> No. I just thought we were going to an early dinner together. 
<user1> Parents can be great sometimes. Did you have a good time?
<user1> What did you find?
<user0> old toys, sports equipment, video games etc
<user1> I love old school video games. What were your favorites?
<user0> chrono trigger was my favorite
<user0> Congratulations. Interviews can be stressful
<user1> True. The interview I had before I got this job went so, so badly. I studied some common questions so I was ready the next time.
<user0> Thats smart. And it worked.
<user0> Nice. What is his name?
<user1> Churro. He's a boxer mix.
<user0> Nice. I like dogs.
<user0> Oh my that sounds so scary! Was everyone ok?
<user1> We were all fine. A bit shaken up, but nobody got hurt thank goodness.
<user0> Do you think you will ever zip line again?
<user1> Oh yes. It was a great experience.
<user1> oh no. What do you do for that?
<user0> We had to leave the restaurant before everyone could order drinks.
<user1> Oh. How old is he?
<user0> He is one and it was sad because I stay at home all day so that was my chance for some interaction.
<user0> Well, I hope you are feeling better. What makes you so nervous? Are you worried your superiors will look down on you leaving early?
<user1> No we are allowed to help each other but I'm worried his code will not pass once the program is done. 
<user0> I'm sure you can get in tomorrow and see how it looks. You can work together to make sure it works!
<user1> I work so. I want to trust him but we have only worked together a few weeks. 
<user1> That is very cool! How much did it cost?
<user0> I did all the work my self but the parts were around 4500 besides the price off the all work I've all ready done to it. I'm trying to build a grocery getter that I can take to the race track.
<user1> Wow, sounds nice! Was it hard to do the work?
<user0> Not really I enjoy working on cars. I work a white collar job so I went off work I like to do something different. 
<user0> Dang, that really stinks. Why did they quit so quickly?
<user1> The  work was to physically hard for them. But I still had big hopes for them. 
<user0> Perhaps you should screen new employees better? Like give them a physical performance test?
<user1> I wish. It's hard to find anyone that is willing to work hard.
<user1> I hope it's nice for you. Do you have any alternate plans?
<user0> We do, but I think my friends want to do the amusement park as well as something else. I don't know if I have money for both.
<user1> Well, that's always a problem for me too, but at least you've got another $1.25 now.
<user1> I think that is wonderful, it's about time more countries and states are making this medicine an option.
<user0> the way it ended up being legalized, IMO, was a complete disgrace, they confiscated some childs weed who was epileptic, and as a result - predictably - he immediately started having seizured without it. Like gee, well done on torturing the kid! Do you think it was right to confiscate it, even though it technically wasnt legal at the time?
<user1> No, but as Mark Twain once said, the law is an ass. 
<user0> what an excellent quote 
<user1> I'm glad they made the right decision eventually though. It's about time!
<user1> The coolest race I saw was late at night on the highway out of town.
<user0> I am a bad driver, otherwise I might like it.
<user1> Yeah, it can be pretty dangerous, but I was young.
<user0> Sometimes I race after the stop light, but that's it.
<user0> I'm sorry to hear that. How long did you have him? 
<user1> I had him for two years. He was my best friend.
<user0> I bet pets are amazing. They're hard to replace once they're a part of the family
<user1> Exactly, I just don't know how I'm going to get over it. I don't want another hamster I want Donatello back.
<user1> Oooh, that's rough. Did you make him mad?
<user0> No, he just doesn't understand the meaning of loyalty.
<user1> Well, I hope you can work things out at least
<user1> Flying has seemingly become terrible these days. What about your trip was so bad?
<user0> It was snowingh really bad and the plane had to land in SC instead of Chicago
<user1> That sounds frustrating and a little scary.  Did you eventually make it to your destination?
<user0> No, I decided to cancel and eventually went home next day.It was the best idea.
<user1> That's too bad.  But better safe than sorry.
<user0> Yea that was the idea. Go back to safety zone. No place like home. Have you traveled much ?
<user1> Not too much.  I used to fly a lot but not anymore.  I stick around home now mostly.
<user1> Well, have you tried reliving that through the Pokemon app that you can interact with?
<user0> No, I need the real thing it just doesn't feel the same.
<user1> Yes, I can understand that.. Sometimes nothing compares.. Have you guys played recently?
<user1> I know how that feels. I bet it was boring and lonely.
<user0> Yeah, it was. I didn't have much to do all that weekend and the apartment was quiet.
<user1> Did you get out and do anything?
<user1> That really is a big change for you! Are you excited to have some more down time?
<user0> I am but also not sure how I feel like him "leaving the nest". 
<user1> Yeah, that feeling will change when you see him coming home with a huge smile on his face!
<user0> I hope so!
<user0> Was it a long flight? Or was there lots of turbulance? 
<user1> It was about 9 hours. A little bit of turbulance. I just have nothing to do on flights.
<user0> Ah, I can't imagine being up in the air that long! Sounds like it was a boring flight too. 
<user1> Well the sights outside were pretty
<user0> I guess that is one positive! 
<user0> Did you study hard?
<user1> Yes, it just baffles me. Maybe next time I shouldn't even study.
<user0> No, you should keep studying.
<user0> That stinks, it's never worth giving up though! What line of work do you prefer?
<user1> Video work. It is very competitive.
<user0> I can definitely believe that.. I hope something opens up for you soon!
<user0> What was so fun?
<user1> Taking my dog to the dog park!
<user0> Oh yeah!!! I love taking my dog too, she gets to get all that dang energy out before I bring her back to our little apartment!
<user1> Yeah, my golden retriever is really happy to meet people. For some reason he doesn't care much for other dogs.
<user1> That sucks, I love dogs.
<user0> Me too. She is a better place now.
<user1> Yes I am sure she it.
<user1> Wow.. That is horrific!  I'm so glad you're okay.. Was anyone else hurt?
<user0> No, by the grace of god. He protects me at all times.
<user1> Awesome. I am so glad to hear that.. Always good to hear the stories were someone gets away!!
<user1> I agree with that! I just had the rain cancel my trip to the beach yesterday! Makes me so mad...
<user0> Yeah, some people like the rain! I don't get how.....
<user1> I mean I like the rain at certain times.. But not when I'm trying to do fun stuff outside!
<user0> At least it's the summer so being in the rain doesn't make you freezing cold! If you're in the northern hemisphere that is.
<user0> That is such a brilliant idea, are you excited about it?
<user1> Yeah, I have more years left.
<user0> That's awesome, you'll thank yourself later down the road for making yourself do it!
<user1> I hope to get a cool job, not sure what industry I want to be in, maybe cars or airplanes.
<user1> Oh wow! I have heard of that happening to lots of people. Did they get arrested?
<user0> Not yet. People these days just don't care. They steal anything they lay their eyes on!
<user1> Yes they do. It has gotten really bad around here with car thefts. It's no wonder are car insurance rates are so high.
<user1> Oh really? What'd ya get?
<user0> Just stuff for dinner. At the checkout, a guy took my receipt!
<user1> Why did he do that?
<user0> I am not sure. He was on his phone though.
<user0> Math is a tough subject. Good for you.
<user1> I know, I feel like I can solve math problems that even Einstein couldn't solve.
<user0> Being good at math will open lots of opportunities for you. Keep at it.
<user0> How exciting that you were able to do that. I hope it was fun.
<user1> It has been a fun summer! I am so tired though.
<user0> It's funny how you need a vacation to recover from vacation.
<user1> Oh yes! I have so many pictures to go through though!
<user1> How'd it go
<user0> It went well, I think I gained confidence by being so prepared
<user1> That's great. Do you present often?
<user1> Oh no, what happened?
<user0> I ended up running back to my place
<user1> Glad you are safe!
<user1> Have you talked to her about it?
<user0> Not yet, she's also been texting other guys as well I think
<user1> That doesn't sound too good. Has she been like this before?
<user1> Was it fun? Interesting? Engaging?
<user0> Yeah, it was fun, and we did so well
<user1> Good! Team based projects can be very hit or miss depending on your team so I'm glad it worked out for you
<user1> Did she give you a reason?
<user0> She fell out of love with me
<user1> Sorry to hear that, i hope you find somebody else in your life.
<user1> Sorry to hear that.Did you lose money?
<user0> I left in the bathroom and was able to get it back
<user1> So, you never actually lost the wallet.
<user1> That sounds amazing! How did it go?
<user0> It was a lot of fun, I had no idea he was planning it
<user1> That's amazing, I have only had one brithday party like that in my life.
<user1> What kind?
<user0> Some action figures I had when I was younger, I felt pretty nostalgic
<user1> I use to have a G.I Joe.
<user1> What were they sick from?
<user0> Flu, I went over and gave him some food and medicine
<user1> That was nice of you.
<user1> I'll bet you were surprised. Were you glad to see them?
<user0> I was very happy to see him, we ended up going out for drinks
<user1> Did you reconnect and promise to keep in touch?
<user1> Was she your girlfriend?
<user0> No, but we did end up going out on a date
<user1> That is great, did you have fun?
<user1> Yeah, thats rough. I hate having to clean up mess that wasn't my fault.
<user0> Yeah, it was pretty gross. A lot of rotten food.
<user1> Yeah, that sounds annoying. Maybe try to scold the dog so they won't do it again?
<user0> I did. He is just a puppy, so hopefully he will grow out of it.
<user0> That sucks. What was his name?
<user1> Barney. He was such a good boy.
<user0> Barney was the name of my hamster.
<user0> I know that feeling. It's nerve racking trying to incorporate everything you learned at the DMV in real time.
<user1> It really is. It's like I can't remember all the rules of the road.
<user0> It's also scary thinking about getting in a car accident the whole time, that would definitely get me nervous.
<user0> My wife, LOVES taylor swift. 
<user1> I actually went to high school with her. I cannot believe she is as famous as she is.
<user0> That is awesome, I went to high school with Brett Favre! Small world.
<user0> I am glad you love her, it must be a nice feeling
<user1> Yes, I just can't see myself being with another woman.
<user0> That is a good thing then
<user0> That wasn't smart.
<user1> I know I promised myself I wasn't going to drink anymore.
<user0> Why did you then?
<user0> Dang.. my old roommate was an engineering student. He always told me how hard it was. What kind of engineering?
<user1> I'm doing mechanical, it's pretty hard but it's interesting. A career in the field would be awesome!
<user0> Yeah, I think once you get in the field, you're set. The jobs seem to pay well. Good luck with that, you sound like you know what you're doing.
<user1> Thanks, I hope I can keep it up, good luck to you as well!
<user1> Oh, the bus? Yeah I bet that was a little embarrassing. Sorry to hear that. I take my car for granted. Maybe you will get one someday.
<user0> I drove my parents' old car for a little, and i definitely took that for granted until it broke down lol. I'm trying to save up, I hope I get one too.
<user1> Well, keep working at it. It's a process. 
<user0> Absolutely. I also enjoy biking around sometimes because its green and gets you some exercise.
<user0> Where has he been?
<user1> I live away from my parents, he lives with them.
<user0> Oh I bet you are excited then! He will be happy too!
<user1> Yup goldens are happy about pretty much anything lol :) Do you have any pets?
<user1> Is there a reason why you didn't tell your boss?
<user0> I just didn't want to be labeled as a snitch, but now I'm having second thoughts.
<user1> Is there a way you could report it anonymously?
<user1> Oh I do too! I like a nice sunny day.
<user0> How has the weather been where you are.
<user1> It's been really rainy. My power just went out awhile ago.
<user0> Oh no, does that happen a lot when it rains near you?
<user1> Yes it makes me pretty upset to be honest.
<user0> Hopefully it doesn't rain this week but the forecast is at least 60% all week!
<user0> My brother used to have a yo-yo! He did a trick called "Around the world" and also one called "The cradle." Know those?
<user1> Yes, my favorite was called "Walk the dog".
<user0> Oh yeah! I remember that! I wasn't good at doing any of them. I mostly just watched him. Good memories.
<user0> Oh man I would have terrified I hate being up so high. He sounds really brave!
<user1> I know, he usually never goes on dangerous rides.
<user0> Did he go on anymore after that?
<user0> Well he's young, so you can't really fault him.
<user1> I didn't really care too much. I had remembered to pack him an extra set of clothes though.
<user0> That's good. You seem like a great parent.
<user0> does it happen often in your part of the country?
<user1> Yes especially in the summer time storms are bad and hurricanes are at a high I hide under my covers lol.
<user0> wow.  i can only imagine
<user0> Thats nuts.
<user1> Whats worse is that I was in the wrong restroom. It was the girls restroom. I just wanted to get out of there as fast as I could.
<user0> Did she scream?
<user0> Did you get to? What happened?
<user1> I went to Sea World for the very first time. We got to feed the dolphins.
<user0> I have never been there! Sounds fun, but I don't support Sea World and the way they treat their animals.
<user0> OH GOSH! I would burn the whole house down. i'm terrified of spiders and bugs
<user1> OMG me too! I hit it with a rolled up news paper and a bunch of baby spiders came out. I had a panic attack and stomped on them.
<user0> i would have a heart attack!
<user0> I know how you feel. Life is too short.
<user1> yes, I try to remind myself that I still have a lot to offer.
<user0> Yes, you do! Just keep living everyday like your last.
<user0> wow, I never did understand why people want to get drunk in the first place. I sure hope he wasn't hurt.
<user1> I wasn't mad at him. I just never knew he was that athletic.
<user0> it does sound like an amzing feat
<user0> ohh that's rough...did you talk to them about it
<user1> No, sometimes I feel like they just don't understand me.
<user0> do they give you any kind of value...or do they just ignore you / put you down 90% of the time?
<user0> Is your relative okay now?
<user1> oh yes, thank you for asking. other family members just got a call and told them everything went ok. Kind of scary when I was sent for.
<user0> It must've have been. Glad they are okay now.
<user0> Congratulations to him! You must be proud.
<user1> I am, every time he succeeds, I succeed. I love my big headed brother.
<user0> He's very lucky to have you.
<user0> oh yeah what happened? 
<user1> I forgot to pick him up as I overslept
<user0> omg is he upset? 
<user0> So did you help him / her
<user1> Yeah, he didn't know of anyone else to turn to for help so I gave him a hand
<user0> That's pretty nice of you
<user0> Wow, thats a nice car
<user1> Yes, I don't know how a clown like him ended up with one before I did.
<user0> It happens sometimes I guess
<user0> Memories.. what state? 
<user1> Can't say, but I was mostly just thinking about the friends I had there growing up
<user0> I understand but memories are always nice. 
<user0> What happened with your car then?
<user1> My car was hit while parked
<user0> Ugh! that stinks! Did you found out who did it?
<user0> I would love that show
<user1> It was a very good show, but the people were so rude. We had to squeeze through a crazy crowd and didn't make it to the bathroom in time.
<user0> Oh well, it happens
<user0> Have you been to the doctor?
<user1> yes i had. he prescribed medicine for curing 
<user0> You will be fine then
<user1> i will take care of my self. thank you so much for your concern. take care of you too.
<user1> Well that is quite the accomplishment. 
<user0> It is certainly much better than I was ever able to do.  I think my scholarship was $500 and I had no merit aide.  He set his academic bar high... I just told him to do his best.
<user1> He sounds like he has a great head on his shoulder. You must have taught him well.
<user1> Oh man, that's so nerve-wracking. Do you think you guys will be a good fit?
<user0> He spent some time laying out his beliefs and his expectations, and I have to say, I agreed with all but one of them.  That's pretty good.  He spent a lot of time watching the rest of us interact with each other, so I think he is trying to feel us out without making judgments yet.
<user1> Then it sounds like at least he has some perspective and ability to know not to overreact. I guess you could say you lucked out, but that may be me speaking too prematurely
<user1> I hope you make it. Thats a big birthday.
<user0> It is day after tomorrow and I am still not certain I can work it out. Sometimes people are very inconsiderate.
<user1> That not good. Maybe she will understand if you just can't make it.
<user1> Wow... That would be one of my worst fears. How did they even manage to do that?
<user0> They had gone to a fair and decided to stop on their way home and walk around. I guess her husband lost track of time. The worst thing is they haven't eaten anything since about noon.
<user1> Wow! Any way they can get out? Did they call someone?
<user1> I know it is hard to start letting go, but it gets easier with time.  Don't worry, you are not alone.
<user0> That's what my own mother says.  In fact, she said my dad had a harder time than she did when I called and said, "Hey, I'm staying the night at so and so's, be back tomorrow."  I guess I will survive!  Hopefully he will choose to spend time here as he hits his 20s!
<user1> Yeah, they always seem to come back!  You just have to love them from afar for  a while.
<user1> That's really sweet. We don't have gas station attendants here. But that's nice that they're that helpful.
<user0> The one I refer to is more like a cashier. He is supposed to stay in a little shack and collect money and turn the pumps on. The lady offered him a tip and he wouldn't take it.
<user1> Ohh, that makes sense. Yeah, then that's really nice of them! And really sweet of her to offer a tip. I guess there's good in the world after all.
<user1> I would absolutely be scared too. Good news or bad, I would be a worried wreck beforehand. Have you gotten it checked out yet?
<user0> I finally went to an ENT doctor in May.  They biopsied it, and that was the most nerve-wracking five days I have ever waited.  It WAS good news, but still had to have removed.
<user1> I'm so glad to hear it was good news, though!
<user1> Thats great of you. Life is VERY unfair but we can go at any minute, so cherish those you love!
<user0> It can be difficult. But I learned early on retaliating helps nothing.
<user1> It doesn't help us no. But you must take care of yourself too- Take some time for yourself when being a caregiver ok!
<user1> Coming back to work could be good after a break.
<user0> A month is a great break to "get away from the daily grind" but believe me, at the end of week one you think oh, I have all the time in the world, and you aren't as productive.
<user1> I understand
<user1> That isn't good.
<user0> I arrived at church just as everyone was leaving. Boy did I feel awkward
<user1> Did anyone help you?
<user1> I wish I could feel that feeling, (unfortunately, I am a man). What did you end up naming your son?
<user0> I named him George, men can have feelings of their sons too. Hopefully one day you will as well.
<user1> I am greatly looking towards starting a family with my wife as well. George is such a nice name.
<user0> Thank you! My husband was excited when I was pregnant, but I don't think he got it until he arrived.
<user0> I have - but not for anything that severe. Are you suffering any side effects of the stroke?
<user1> I am 99% me  The hardest part of the hospitalization was at the end of the day when my last visitor would go home. I am not good at being alone.
<user0> Yup - I know that feeling. And it's always so hard falling asleep in those uncomfortable beds with an IV in your arm.
<user0> That really sucks man. Are you planning on looking for a new one?
<user1> I love my job, it involves my five year old kid and my eighty year old grandma.
<user0> Well, as long as you're doing something you enjoy, that's all that really matters.
<user1> It does! I love being there with my family.
<user1> Have you figured out what's the problem?
<user0> I have not, it seems to do ok except when my son puts his foot on there even though I tell him repeatedly not to do that!
<user1> Sounds like maybe one of the legs on the table is bent? 
<user0> It could be, I just hate when he doesn't listen!
<user0> Yes? thats so cute, but you have to be carefull not to say bad words in fron of them
<user1> I know!  She said the f word!
<user0> OMG, well it is a bad thing but now you can be more polite in front of them, and also when you are not with them!
<user0> Are you keeping it as a souvenir?
<user1> I am, I plan to scrapbook it once I get the pictures back.
<user0> Nice, I do that sometimes with movie tickets if it's a great movie that I enjoed a lot.
<user0> I've been camping a few times - the proximity to others makes me feel stuffy too. Where do you usually go?
<user1> We went by a lake.  I accidentally opened the bathroom door with someone in it!
<user0> Oh wow! I bet the person inside would've pooped his pants, but there was probably none left!
<user0> What happened?? Did you guys went camping or something?
<user1> My grandmother fell ill, and passed away.
<user0> Ho, I am sorry to hear that.
<user0> Too late I already took it. Just kidding, did you find it?
<user1> I did, they left it sitting in the middle of the driveway so it could get run over!
<user0> Oh, that's bad. Was there anything important in it?
<user1> It was some pills for my dog, luckily I found it before it got run over. 
<user1> Wao thats so cool you must so excited, how long has it been?
<user0> about a year. I am on the east coast and they moved out west
<user1> Wao it must be very difficult to be separated from your wife and son, sorry
<user1> Oh yeah? Do you have to do that every game?
<user0> When I have my son with us I do! My husband was shocked when he said he wanted his blanket and I pulled one out of my purse!
<user1> Thats funny. Well at least it sounds like you are always prepared. 
<user1> That's cool. I am not a swinger either.
<user0> Staying with the same guy day in and day out over a long period of time can be tough.
<user1> How did you do it?
<user0> It's a commitment to stay with just one person.
<user0> That makes no sense.
<user1> Exactly!  The roofer told me that since I replaced my roof and the leak was still there, the problem had to be my fireplace chimney.  He said stone chimneys often develop leaks.  As it turns out, this chimney guy fabricates a type of gutter for chimneys to keep the water from running down the rock.  For $300 he made and installed the "gutter" on site, and I have had NO leaks!
<user0> That seems like a good price.
<user0> right now it's freezing in my home lol I just got out of bed after 30 mins of sitting because it's coold
<user1> what? where the hell do you live? what do you mean its freezing? oh my god i am so jealous
<user0> haha i live in virginia where right now the temperture outside is muggy 85 degress just regular ac pumping in my home
<user1> ooooh you have an AC, thats why. I live in europe and AC's...arent a thing at all, only the occasional pharmacy will have an AC
<user0> aw man that must suck how do you huys keep cool through the summer
<user1> we dont, icecream and cold drinks is literally it. 
<user1> I'm sorry, How long has it been?
<user0> Happened in Febuary.
<user1> That's always a tragedy.
<user0> Yea she was 12 yaers old, and had cataracts, so I knew it would happen someday
<user0> That's nerve wracking for sure.  How did it go?
<user1> Well we had dinner and the whole time a was stuttering because her father was asking very personal questions, but I think they liked me.
<user0> It probably went well, despite the common jokes most parents want their child to date someone good so try to look for the best in people.
<user0> Oh nice! How long did you guys stay?
<user1> We went for a week, but did have to come back to town once.
<user0> Oh no, What happened?
<user1> Nothing bad.  We actually purchased a house to pick up and move, and they drove it down the road the week that we were on vacation.
<user1> Oh yea? Where are you guys? In the mountains? Camping?
<user0> We went camping, yes.  We're in the Midwest, so no mountains, unfortunately.  But we were near a lake.
<user1> Lakes are awesome. A body of water around here is pretty far. How long are you guys staying?
<user0> We were out there for a week.
<user0> Did you get anything extra, like a bonus or a trip.
<user1> I think I might get promoted based on the work
<user0> Great. What business is it?
<user0> I can tell where this is going.
<user1> I got completely drenched, it was terrible
<user0> That has never happened to me. Thank god!
<user0> Well does that make you anxious?
<user1> It does, this is my only child and he is going to kindergarten.
<user0> Oh, that would be rough. I've been through that too.
<user1> How did you make it through?
<user1> Are you happy for him?
<user0> Kind of, it's going to be sad since I won't see him again most likely
<user1> But if is a great opportunity for him, you should be happy.
<user1> That's very nice of the friend. What sort of problem was it?
<user0> Computer problem.  It was something I couldn't figure out on my own
<user1> Bah, those newfangled computers. It's nice to have a tech saavy friend.
<user1> Why do you think they do that?
<user0> They don't want to talk on the phone and can get away with it for a while.
<user1> That's not fair and probably very frustrating for you. You need to say something to them.
<user0> I agree, I'm actually up for a new position so if that happens they'll actually have to do work for a change.
<user0> Oh man, I can't even imagine. I lived in Kansas for a while and we had a storm that did a lot of damage. Took out the power all day and stuff. Nature can be so devastating sometimes.
<user1> We aren't too far south of Kansas in Oklahoma. We have had to spend a few evenings in the storm shelter. I guess stuff can be replaced. 
<user0> Jeeeze, yea, it's totally understandable to be afraid. Has it been good there otherwise?
<user1> I love it here, except for the tornadoes and snakes. 
<user0> It's awesome to hear that! I guess no place can ever be perfect though. Here's hoping we both can live long, happy, and fulfilling lives!
<user0> That must be so disappointing. Is there something else you can do to have fun?
<user1> Kiteboard but I left half the gear at home. The surf report said 10 foot waves and it's flat water. Not cool bro, not cool
<user0> Sounds like you really like the water. So what do you do now?
<user1> Go to the surf bar I guess. 
<user1> Wow! I've never been anywhere near there.
<user0> It's a surf trip. They have monster waves. I'm nervous. 
<user1> I've been to the ocean a few times but I've never even seen a surfer. We had a small boogie board.
<user0> Do you live inland? 
<user1> I live in Tennessee
<user0> I've been river surfing in Tennessee. You have some decent white water rivers that offer boating and also surfing.
<user1> Wow. I must have a boring life then, because I have only seen tug boats and barges on the Mississippi.
<user1> Oh no! How come?
<user0> You guess is as good as mine. She's crazy. Today she was stressed. Mind you she is 22 lives at home and has no bills.
<user1> Oh well maybe she has a lot of problems internally. You never know how someone's home life is like.
<user0> She did mention this morning that her doctor said she needs meds or locked up. 
<user1> Aw well it's likely bipolar- I know a phew. They have a hard time even on meds. 
<user0> Yesterday before work she got in a fist fight with her equally crazy mother before work over salted peanuts. 
<user0> I would save some and maybe get something you need/want?
<user1> Don't really need anything but it was a great way to start the day.
<user0> For sure! Any extra money is always good!
<user1> I'm thinking easy come easy go. Maybe do something fun this weekend I'm normally to broke to do.
<user1> Had she done that to you before?
<user0> Right before that I found out she was seeing other people while I was in Iraq.
<user1> What a shame! 
<user0> Yea, it worked out for the best. A few months after that I meet my wife and we have been together for 11 years now. First baby is on the way in December. 
<user1> Congratulations!
<user1> Oh man! I wish work stress would make me lose weight lol. I gain! Are you looking for a new job?
<user0> Yes, that or a new boss. I love my job but my boss is terrible.
<user1> Oh I don't deal with that well. I hope you get a new boss!
<user0> I give it to the end of the year. By that time I'll be slim thanks to all the weight I'll loose and then look for a new job. 
<user0> Wow, what brand
<user1> Bmw 8 series. It's my neighbors kid. 
<user0> That is a nice car
<user1> Yea. I was his age in 2000. I drove a 30 year old rust bucket. 
<user1> Yeah all the time. I get so jealous
<user0> Yea well I lost 25 pounds and now i'm that guy. Happy in my skin. 
<user1> Wow, that is hard to do. Congratulations my dude!
<user0> Thanks. It was rough I love desert but no desert food for 6 months. 
<user0> That sounds awesome!  Is Elbert a fourteener?
<user1> Yes, it's the tallest in Colorado. This will be my 3rd time climbing it. But the first time since I got old and Lazy. 
<user0> Hahaha.  Well, I hope you don't get sick.  Take something salty with you, maybe that will help.  Have fun!
<user1> Last time I arrived and tried to climb it the same day. My head felt like it was going to explode.
<user1> Congratulations. I bet you're happy!
<user0> Yea, time to advance my career now.
<user1> Do you work for a company or on your own?
<user0> I'm self employed but new to the business.
<user1> Cool beans
<user1> Were you able to get it back?
<user0> I was, and I ended up getting enough to pay the deposit and then some.
<user1> That's great! I bet that was a relief.
<user1> Wow, that should have been amazing
<user0> It really was. It also made me want to eat chocolate. 
<user1> Me too, I love chocolate
<user1> I've always been too scared to do a backflip. I always worry I'm going to break my neck or something. Did it take him a long time to get it right?And did he get hurt?
<user0> I think he just took gymnastics classes. He luckily did not get hurt!
<user1> Oh, that makes sense. And I'm glad to hear that. I always worry about that sort of thing. You ever think about trying to do it netx?
<user1> Are you sick?
<user0> Yeah, I have health problems, it's complicated. 
<user1> That sucks, I will pray for you.
<user0> Thank you, I appreciate you being kind. 
<user0> Oh my, that must've been an embarrassing situation!
<user1> It was! I knocked first and no one answered, so I thought it was okay to go in. 
<user0> That's ok, you did the right thing. It probably happens to lots of people.
<user1> Thanks, I'm sure it does haha
<user1> Yes, what about it?
<user0> So i guess I just dropped it, and a very old man, picked it up and gave it back to me
<user1> That was nice of him.
<user1> Tell me all about it.
<user0> Well, it was still dark and too early, but I felt like I had enough sleep.
<user1> I try to always go for extra sleep.
<user1> Wow! 30th is a big milestone birthday! I can imagine that everyone was excited to get to share that with you.
<user0> Thank you! I was glad to share that moment with them.
<user1> Did you feel old after?
<user0> Haha, not really. I feel older now. 
<user0> That had to be relief. So now you won't have to deal with that frustration again.
<user1> Yes indeed, it was frustrating!  I didn't have time to mess with it everytime i had to print something.
<user0> Those keyboard shortcuts can be lifesavers.
<user1> Yes they can. I have become much more productive as a result.
<user1> Thats good. Everyone isnt so fortunate.
<user0> For sure, thank you. Times can change very unexpectedly. 
<user1> Its goof to have support when it does change.
<user0> Definitely, I think we all need to support each other better in this world. 
<user1> Exactly
<user0> Hopefully we can find some kindness in the world and get the support we all need. 
<user1> We would all be better people then
<user1> oh wow. Bet it felt amazing. was it a mistake?
<user0> Thanks! It wasn't a mistake. Just unexpected and pretty neat!
<user1> sounds like a great day. makes you wish it would happen everyday
<user0> I definitely wish that could happen!
<user0> That's so embarrassing! What did you do?
<user1> I picked them up and tried to move to another area!
<user0> Did anyone say anything?
<user1> I don't think so. I seem to do these things quite often.
<user0> Well at least you got away with it this time!
<user1> Haha, I think as long as I put them back, no one minds.
<user1> Really? Why was that?
<user0> I think I felt concerned that the plane would crash or that something else bad might happen. 
<user1> Do you normally feel like that when you fly?
<user0> I do sometimes, but this time it was even more so.
<user0> I can understand that, flying is scary.
<user1> It is. We ended up going through a thunderstorm.
<user0> I'm glad you didn't get hurt.
<user1> Thank you! There was a lot of turbulence, so that was not fun.
<user1> Hey, do you have anything on your mind?
<user0> Yeah! i just received an email from guild wars 2 customer support, I lost my game code so i couldnt recover my account (forgot password), and they sent an email back asking me for the code. its so surprising having to deal with people this stupid, you would think that they would never get hired to begin with
<user1> I agree, incompetent customer support is one of the worst things when dealing with such problems.
<user0> its so surprising though, They were hired to do ONE thing, and then they fail at that one thing, how did you get hired D: online stores have a similar problem with indians - I have nothing against them but the people online stores elect to hire are ones who cant speak english which results in your problem never getting solved cause they dont understand you. 
<user0> oh I am so sorry for your loss.
<user1> Yeah, it was terrible.  Heart wrenching to bury him.
<user0> I bet. You gave him a good long life, that was the best you could do.
<user0> I am sorry it was so stressful
<user1> They had many qualified candidates and it took a full week for them to make their decision.
<user0> Just hope for the best
<user0> ugh thats the worst right.. everyone should have holidays off. 
<user1> It wasn't even a holiday, just on a Saturday during the day because the drive was so long.
<user0> I say skip work next time :p go for it 
<user0> i just love that, my son knows ASL
<user1> That's great! I taught her a few words that were interesting to her so she could tell us what she needed.
<user0> i wish schools would teach kids asl 
<user1> Yeah, me too that would be nice for them to learn.
<user1> she wants to spend time with you
<user0> Well no, she knew we couldn't go out late because of my son's bedtime and scheduled it anyway.
<user1> that was nice of her
<user1> its a beautiful place
<user0> I'm sure it is, but she is very young and still looks for me in the morning.
<user1> in that case i agree then
<user1> Where are you going on vacation?
<user0> We went to New Jersey, so a long way for us. We had a toddler, so I had to make sure I had everything for her.
<user1> That is close for me, but it is a fun time!
<user1> i admire that 
<user0> I just wander, is this normal?
<user1> no its not
<user1> I see, have you tried yoga and meditation? 
<user0> Nope.But have been practicing breathing and muscle relaxation
<user1> Keep a positive mindset and your anxieties will be relieved! 
<user0> I hope so.Thank you for youre support.
<user0> Oh my, you must have very surprised! 
<user1> Yes, I was not expecting it at all. They invited us over to hang out.
<user0> It must have been an enjoyable day. You have nice friends!
<user0> i bet she was so excited!! Did she love her presents?
<user1> Yeah she did, but I guess I was looking forward to it more than she was.
<user0> that was me last christmas lol my son was only 9 months old but i bought so many presents and i was so excited to see his reaction
<user0> Oh no. Why are you worried to lose it?
<user1> I don't have as much work to do as in the past and no one needs help with anything.
<user0> Oh no.. That is a bit scary. I wish the best for you!
<user1> Thanks! I hope more work will come soon. Are you doing well? 
<user0> I am, thank you for asking!
<user0> Oh no, why not?!
<user1> The guy that took my order was rude, but I understand, most people can't control themselves...
<user0> They really can't. It's still no excuse though.
<user0> Oh that sucks...did she explain herself yet
<user1> No, she just completely blew me off. I found out she was out on a date instead and didn't tell me.
<user0> Sounds like you need a new friend or your own car...or both lol
<user0> That's terrible.  Someone should call animal control on them.
<user1> I know, what kind of human being would do that to a poor dog! I'm going to call animal control soon.
<user0> I hope they do something to help that poor puppy.
<user0> what happened ? 
<user1> when i knocked on the door i felt the door was open and i thought as he is in home itself i felt i can go in but suddenly his dog jumped on me
<user0> did he end up biting you?? 
<user1> no he but he pushed me with his legs and body he was so strong
<user1> Oh no, that's terrible!  Are both you and your dog alright now?
<user0> Yes, I took him to the vet and got him the help he needed. The possibility of losing my best friend had me frightened!
<user1> Yes, that would have frightened me too.  I'm glad he's alright now.
<user1> I hope and wish so. In this tough economic climate many are finding it difficult to cope with financial responsibilities
<user0> Yes, and we had a layoff of five months.  I believe in a brighter day, though, so I know it will improve.
<user1> Being optimistic will help you alleviate much of your accumulated stress
<user1> that is literally the worst, the people should have atleast told you to go ahead  first! 
<user0> Oh I know. People just gladly go, but the cashiers should be taught to take the next person in line.
<user1> its really so rude. ugh im sorry 
<user1> I love dogs too what breed do you have ?
<user0> I have a 4 yr old golden do you have any?
<user1> i have a german shepard
<user0> Awesome how old is he/she?
<user0> That's awesome.  What did it take for you to get there
<user1> A lot of years struggling, and finalizing realizing that the struggle is the normal part of it all.  Acceptance and steadfastness led to happiness, I guess.
<user0> Sounds like you've gotten smarter and more observant over the years
<user0> Oh how gross! I don't like possums anyways 
<user1> Yeah me neither lol any wildlife where you live?
<user0> Just lizards and gators. I live in South Florida haha
<user1> Cool I lived there for 2 years, lizards were indeed everwhere.
<user1> I have heard about that game.  I heard there was one guy that makes about $500,000 a month playing it on the streaming service Twitch.  Maybe your son should give it a try.
<user0> I have never heard of Twitch.  That is a lot of money, I could retire!
<user1> Twitch is just a place where people stream themselves playing video games.  I guess a lot of people really love watching good players.  Go ahead and retire now and get him started!
<user1> I'm sorry your friend moved away. Sounds like me when I moved from Indiana to Florida. My friend was upset when I left too.
<user0> He doesn't deserve to live in luxury! He gets to chill on the beaches and I'm stuck out here in the dessert.
<user1> That is your friend, you should be happy for them! 
<user1> Aw I am happy for you! What do you go to school for?
<user0> Engineering its tough but I think its really cool.
<user1> That is great! Good luck to you!
<user0> Thanks, anything you're looking forward to in the near future?
<user0> I bet! I can't imagine what that must be like to see a bran new life.
<user1> It changed my whole outlook on everything.  I have never felt such happiness condensed in such a short period of time/
<user0> That's awesome :) I'm happy for you! Hopefully one day I will get to see that
<user0> Hopefully the things coming out of his mouth are good things, right?
<user1> I wish, he sometimes says curse words.
<user0> Oh.  I recommend correcting that before it gets out of hand.  Good luck!
<user1> Thanks! I was shocked that he picked up on that, my little playback machine!
<user1> What movie were you watching?
<user0> I think it was called Rampage. 
<user1> That is a great movie.
<user1> I do.  It feels great to get out into nature doesn't it?
<user0> Yeah I always enjoy hiking in the mountains or just going to the beach.
<user1> The beach is my most favorite place to go.
<user0> I lived in South Florida for 2 years and the beach got old lol, but once I moved out I appreciated at a bit more.
<user0> That sounds rough, were you able to get accustomed to Texas?
<user1> Yeah, but I had left all my family behind. I didn't know anyone here for quite some time.
<user0> I know what you mean, that happened to me when I left for college a few years ago.
<user0> Wow that is really confident on your end. Are you going to do anything with the girl
<user1> Well that's the attitude you have when you look like Brad Pitt. Maybe take her out to the movies and try to get to second base.
<user0> That sounds exciting. Just make sure she is okay with it all before!
<user0> What was she referring to then?
<user1> She was talking about the rain storms that hit earlier in the week, and asked if we were effected by them. 
<user0> I see.  Do you get a lot of storms in your location?
<user1> Not too much, but when she asked I said we did, but we were talking about two different things.
<user0> I always hate that when you are never on the right wavelength with someone during a conversation
<user0> That movie is a classic! I loved it as a kid!
<user1> Yes, I remember we used to call one of my friends Petrie because he looked exactly like him.
<user0> Hahah! That is awesome!
<user0> get them reported
<user1> I might just do it, thank you.
<user0> You are welcome, if you take your stand they will  behave
<user0> I bet you're both excited and nervous about it! I have two kids of my own and one will be starting in about a year while the other is going to fourth grade.
<user1> I had all these plans when I had my son, they didn't work out but I am wishing that this does!
<user0> I'm sure it will! I hope it all works out for you.
<user1> I hope so as well. I am a few years behind.
<user1> That's always a good thing. It means you should get on great with your neighbors.
<user0> Yes, Just knowing that I'm not alone is such a great feeling.
<user1> Most of my neighbors are good, kind people too, so I know just what you mean.
<user1> Why did you feel anxious?
<user0> i love my job. i eagerly awaited to achieve and go  as long as i want in my life. 
<user1> Hmm.. I'm a little confused.  Why were you anxious?
<user0> i am a workaholic person i want to achieve some more thing in my life. when i go to my work i feel active and energetic. 
<user0> Well that's sweet. How did the policeman react?
<user1> He was so nice, he even volunteered to set up a meeting with the mayor and my son!
<user0> Oh wow! That's awesome! Your son sounds like he has a bright future!
<user1> He was so excited! My husband and I were happy the police officer was so nice.
<user1> I've done that before. Getting over that initial fear is really hard. But it's fun once you do!
<user0> I know, but since it was my first time I didn't know how to act. My mind started to go blank and I started to sweat profusely. 
<user1> I understand completely. It's that initial anxiety. It's a scary thing to do!
<user1> I bet you are pretty anxious and excited at the same time.
<user0> Yeah, she would be able to see the kids, and she hardly ever comes to visit.
<user1> its always nice when grandmas come visit.
<user1> Oh wow, that sounds like it might be cool but I don't know what that looks like, what is the 900?
<user0> It's when you turn a skateboard 900 degrees while spinning in the air. It's very hard to do, so you can imagine the look on my face when I saw my brother do it.
<user1> Yea, how old is your brother?
<user1> I love camping, and understand why a hammock is your favorite. They're so comfortable!
<user0> They are, I love to read a good book while hanging out in the hammock!
<user1> That sounds amazing, as long as you're not reading scary books about the woods!
<user0> I wouldn't do that! Just a good book, where I didn't have to think much!
<user1> I agree. Camping and hammocks are for relaxing and letting the mind be free. 
<user1> I've actually never gone there. What's it like?
<user0> It's pretty awesome! Lots to do for adults as well. I tend to go to Epcot quite often with my annual pass. We live right down the street. 
<user1> That's good to hear. I do plan on taking my kids in the future!
<user0> Absolutely do! Memories of going to Disney with my parents were some of my fondest. 
<user0> Do you live in Flordia? I have family down there and was really worried about them. 
<user1> Yes, I live in Orlando so I was lucky that it was central, but we were out of power for a few days. 
<user0> That was lucky. Losing power is bad, but at least that was it. Scary situation. 
<user0> What will happen if the secret is told?
<user1> Not much, I just value my privacy. Do you have secrets that you tell your friends?
<user0> Of course, I only tell them the best ones though!
<user0> Oh no, was she upset at you or about something else?
<user1> About something else and I wanted to talk to her and make her feel better.
<user0> Well that's really kind of you to help her like that. She's lucky to have you!
<user0> Ugh, people can be so rude. Was he able to go to the bathroom?
<user1> He was not, there were just too many people standing around not moving.
<user0> That's awful!! So what did you end up doing? Did he just have to pop a squat?
<user1> He actually had an accident, because I didn't tell him to just go. Mommy of the year.
<user1> As long as you work hard and stay dedicated, I'm sure it will come!
<user0> I hope so! Hard work and dedication tend to pay off. 
<user1> Absolutely! And if you trust your boss, I'm sure he will do the right thing.
<user1> Thats scary.  Did you have to pull over?
<user0> No we kept driving but the rain was real bad and trucks were swerving.
<user1> I take it you made it out safe beacuse we're here chatting
<user1> That sounds like an awesome Christmas present!  I've actually thought about doing that with my girls now that they are older and not much they really need.  Where are you going?
<user0> We went on the cruise in February. It was a Disney cruise in the Bahamas! What a great experience.
<user1> I've ALWAYS wanted to go on a Disney cruise - it's probably my dream vacation. I'm so jealous!!!
<user1> That's such a great accomplishment and such a relief at the same time. What was your major?
<user0> Communications. It was a little tough but not engineering tough!
<user1> I totally get that. I majored in business but sometimes I wish I majored in engineering. I'm kind of glad I didn't though. It's hard!
<user1> Aww, that is very nice of them. i just had to put mine down a few weeks ago.
<user0> I'm so sorry to hear that. What kind of breed was your dog? 
<user1> Border Collie. Yours?
<user0> Yorkshire Terrier. She was a sweetheart.
<user0> I can imagine! Did you end up having a good flight?
<user1> I did. Luckily no turbulance!
<user0> That's good! Hopefully you had a nice seatmate too!
<user0> Aww, was he scared?
<user1> I don't think so, I think he was just over the day and it was too much for him.
<user0> I can see that. School is a challenging time for a kid.
<user1> I have heard that. Just bummed me out for the day.
<user1> Always good to feel ready for something like that. What subject was it in?
<user0> Engingeering. It was really tough!
<user1> Man, I remember those days. My engineering exams were killer. Did you do well on it?
<user1> Another man's trash is another man's treasure! What things do you save?
<user0> Just different things that I can scrapbook, mementos from my trip. 
<user1> I keep a scrapbook myself! I love collecting stamps. Got any trips planned this year?
<user1> I'm so sorry that happened to you. How did you handle this situation?
<user0> I just pulled them up. it was just embarassing.
<user1> I hope no one saw that, it must've been terrible.
<user1> How are you going to learn! Why are you afraid to go?
<user0> Just nervous about all the people
<user1> It ain't so bad. I'm sure you'll make a few new friends and everything will be just fine.
<user1> Please describe what scared you about the caves.
<user0> Just the darkness.
<user1> That seems like a valid reason to be scared of going into the caves!
<user1> Is there anyway you can move to somewhere more affordable?
<user0> I'm not sure, sometimes I wish I had what the other people around me had.
<user1> I do too but it's natural to get envious of others sometimes, don't put yourself down over it.
<user1> That must be so annoying. I get that sometimes too.
<user0> I feel like people don't care that I have stuff to do.
<user1> I'm sad to hear that, I'm sure there is someone who cars.
<user1> That's good to hear that you care for your son so much. I am sure he will be quite an intelligent child going to the best of the best.
<user0> I hope so, it really helps to get your village when you have kids.
<user1> Yeah, my village helped with my son's preschool tuition as well. Strength in numbers and good neighbors!
<user1> Oh yuck! Where did that happen?
<user0> At Fazolis. It was so gross.
<user1> During dinner? ACK!
<user1> Can you tell me about your recent experience?
<user0> i couldnt believe it when i heard they are making even more new star wars movies
<user1> Yeah, I love Star Wars. I was sad when Han Solo died. He was my favorite character!
<user0> i agree it was very sad. i dont know what they will do with the new films
<user0> That would make me sad, did you let him go? 
<user1> Yeah, I mean I didn't want to tell him he couldn't. I just don't like being by myself.
<user0> I know how you feel, I'm sorry about that, at least he probably came back pretty quickly.
<user0> I'm sure they will understand. You can always have another dinner, that's the beauty of life!
<user1> That is true. Good way to look at things!
<user0> Where did you end up going?
<user0> Oh no, have you look at other options?
<user1> I have and tried negotiating with my old work. I have an interview next week with another company so I hope that goes well!
<user0> I really hope you get it!
<user0> Oh no. Did you flip him off?
<user1> No, I remained calm, but I was very mad!
<user0> That was probably for the best anyway. People who drive like that are the worst, though.
<user0> Wow, that's super annoying! I understand wanting to get things done early, but that's not very respectful to neighbors.
<user1> nope, it was very frustrating, he lives next door too
<user0> Have you talked to him about it?
<user1> yes i did, he hasnt done it since
<user1> are you getting laid off?
<user0> Yes, unfortunately. We are having a huge company layoff and being a remote employee didn't help my case. 
<user1> im sorry, i hope you're able to find an even better job immediately
<user1> Do you live in Florida?
<user0> I do, in Orlando. I feel lucky to have had no damage to my home and been in a central location, but the storm was awful and we had no power for 4 days.
<user1> Wow, that sounds terrifying. You are very lucky to have made it out without any property damage though.
<user1> Thats amazing, you must be a good person
<user0> It's nice to be able to pay for fun things that our budget doesn't allow us to normally do.
<user1> How many kids do you have?
<user1> Sometimes i like to not have other people asking things of me. Alone can be good.
<user0> it was just boring because i had so much work to get done
<user1> Well at least you didn't have a lot of people under foot to slow you down. So I hope the sacrifice of being bored was worth it.
<user1> I am so sorry to hear that!
<user0> My husband had to ask off for a different day without much notice!
<user1> That is the worst. At least you and your husband got something worked out for your son's first day at school! 
<user1>  A walk down memory lane.
<user0> Yeah, it makes me miss being at home and around my family.
<user1> Oh I bet! It's always good to cherish those memories.
<user1> oh that can be annoying, did you tell him anything?
<user0> I just gave him a look. The thing is he says I do that instead of waiting til commercial, but then he goes and does it to me.
<user1> hahah that's kinda funny. Maybe he just missed you!
<user1> Nice! Where did you go?
<user0> Belize. He did doctor stuff. I didn't do much. But it was cool to see what they were up to.
<user1> Oh, that is really cool! What a great experience, and fun to bond with your dad!
<user1> Was it long?
<user0> about an hour
<user1> That's long, I understand the reason behind you being upset 
<user1> I know how you feel, it's always good to bond with your buddies when you can
<user0> Yeah, I really miss seeing them since they moved.
<user1> Thank God you will be able to tell them in person about how much you miss them
<user1> Oh yea, I can relate to the good times, is she still alive?
<user0> no unfortunately she isnt
<user1> oh no. May her soul rest in peace
<user1> Congrats! I'm sure you will have great memories. 
<user0> We do.  10 years being loyal and true to each.  I just hope we have many more!
<user1> I believe you will just continue doing what you've already done.
<user0> thats true.  Are you married yet yourself?
<user1> Yes I am married
<user0> I hope you are as happy as I am.  Its nots easy though, a work in progress, but worth it all in the long run.
<user1> I am happy and yes its a lot of work. Anything worth having takes work to keep it.
<user1> HAve you been practicing? Do you have note cards?
<user0> I don't want to use note cards as I look better without them. I did use them while practicing though.
<user1> I hope you do well. IS it for school?
<user0> Thanks, yeah it is for a summer class in macroeconomics.
<user1> Well congratulation on your A in advance lol
<user0> Thanks I know ill get it lol.
<user0> Oh my gosh! Was it a wild tarantula or a pet?
<user1> It was a wild tarantula. I had my family rush me to the hospital, but I ended up being just fine. It only caused me discomfort for a couple of days.
<user0> Thank goodness! The biggest type of spider we have here if a wolf spider. They don't really bite you unless you irritate them.
<user0> Oh awesome! How are they doing?
<user1> Great. We were just cracking jokes the whole time. It was good to see him.
<user0> Awesome! It's nice to see people who knew you so long ago. No friendships like those!
<user0> Wow, that's really great. What charity did he donate to?
<user1> No, he's starting his own. I'm glad I'm able to call him my bro.
<user0> Oh, sorry. That's awesome. What does his charity support?
<user0> Was the weather nice?
<user1> Yes it was nice outside. I felt very relaxed out there.
<user0> I can't wait until we get nice weather. ITs too hot to do anything
<user0> Some people have no concept of being rude.
<user1> It mad me sick! Do they teach these people about manners?
<user0> no, they dont.
<user0> Are you serious? That is extremely terrible news to hear. :( 
<user1> Yes, I fell to my knees when I heard the news and haven't stopped crying since. My life is pretty much over!
<user0> I really wish I knew what to say, but even watching my mother go thru stage 4 I still dont know what to say! Spend a lot of time with your loved ones! 
<user0> Really, isn't that unusual?
<user1> Not really, I was trying to teach her so she could communicate with us and tell us what she wanted.
<user0> I'm glad it worked out so well for you all .
<user0> I know how stressful that can be. I hope everything turned out alright.
<user1> The wait turned out to be worth it because the results showed that everthing was fine.
<user0> That is great news!
<user0> That wasn't nice. I hope they caught them.
<user1> No unfortunately not.  There were no cameras in the carpark and no one saw anything.  So i am left with the bill.  I hope karma gets them eventually though.
<user0> That sucks, how much is it?
<user1> Not sure yet, I have left it into garage to get priced up but its looks pretty bad. 
<user1> I can relate. You just have to be yourself.  Do you know if you got the job?
<user0> Yeah they offered me the job. I was very excited.
<user1> That’s great!  How do you like it?
<user1> Is it sunny where you are ?
<user0> yes and warm but not too hot
<user1> Glad for you, it's cloudy and humid here.
<user0> that is unfortunate
<user0> Why did you wait a week? Tell her to tell him
<user1> But, he's been my best friend since childhood. I think I should be the one to tell him. I just feel so bad. That's why I postponed it.
<user0> I don't know. You should have told hime when it happended. Just do it and get uit out of the way so you both can move past it.
<user0> That's nice. I always like getting letters.
<user1> did you ever have a pen pal when you were a child?
<user0> no, I never did. It might have been nice.
<user0> 58 million. That's unbelievable.
<user1> I couldn't believe he won it because he's so stingy and I'm such a kind hearted person. I deserve it more!
<user0> Well, you know how to get it from  him right?
<user0> ah congratulations on the engagement! How long have you two been together?
<user1> Thanks buddy. We have been dating for 2 years on and off. I can't wait to show her the ring. I like it a lot and I think she will too.
<user0> No problem. I hope she'll love it as well.
<user0> Oh no. Did you guys talk about it?
<user1> We did. He apologized, but I just hate that he forgot me.
<user0> No one's perfect. I hope you won't hold a grudge.
<user0> How'd it go?
<user1> It went well, I felt like I had everything in order
<user0> Being prepared pays off soemtimes.
<user0> how did you do on it?
<user1> I did well overall, it was easier than I thought
<user0> Good, well I hope you get the better position!
<user0> How strict is the budget?
<user1> Down the last dollar. I have a baby on the way so we've got to bank money
<user0> Ah, that makes sense, well I hope it goes well for you!
<user1> Thank's Im hopeful that we will be able to stick to it. 
<user1> Nice. Did his team finish first?
<user0> they won the game and he played really well
<user1> At his age, they progress very quickly
<user1> That's very nice of them! Having caring friends is very important.
<user0> yes it is
<user1> What did they do for you?
<user1> I bet it does, you should find a podcast you like
<user0> I listen to most of those as I drive. I was thinking of getting into gaming. I have a Tv in the truck and can buy a game system. 
<user1> That is smart, I would recommend a nintendo switch!
<user0> Someone told me that on the CB. But I've never heard of it before earlier today. I've got to do something. The boredom is dragging me down.
<user0> How so?
<user1> My supervisor warned me earlier in the week about it
<user0> I'm sorry. Any way you can get out of it?
<user0> Why's that?
<user1> Because I am scared of heights.
<user0> Have you always been scared of heights?
<user0> Yuck!  You didn't get wet and muddy I hope!
<user1> nope it only rained for a few minutes
<user0> That is good to hear.  No one likes soggy shoes!
<user0> Backflips are scary. Neck injury is serious.
<user1> Yes, but luckily he completed it without hurting anything.
<user0> Thats good! They do look cool too.
<user0> I was scared the first and only time I flew also. Where were you flying to?
<user1> Europe. So a long flight!
<user0> Oh wow! I bet that was really exciting. I have never been out of the country.
<user0> You must feel horrible!  Get her something extra nice and I am sure she will forgive you!
<user1> What should I get her?
<user0> Get her flowers and a gift certificate to a nice massage place!
<user0> I have the same feeling. I miss her also
<user1> She passed last year. She is in a better place.
<user0> Sorry to hear that
<user0> Are you going to have it completed in time?  I hope you are not behind schedule!
<user1> I still have much to be done
<user0> Ouch!  You better knuckle down and burn the midnight oil!
<user0> Wow! I would be amazed too!
<user1> A little worried. While super smart as we get older we gain real world experience in dealing with people that you can not learn in a book. But still at 20 I was struggling with my associates degree. 
<user0> That's so true. Im 30 and just now having the time to work on my bachelors. But I have a lot of work experience.
<user1> I'm 34 and still working on the BA as well. When life got in the way education had to take a back seat.
<user0> Same here. Well I hope he can adapt and do well. Good luck with your BA too!
<user0> Wow. That's pretty hypocritical.
<user1> Yea, I even called and let them know the highway was closed down and I was going to be late. I even text her photo of the traffic accident once I got up to it.
<user0> I think she's just trying to cause a problem.
<user0> Did you not have your own food?
<user1> I didn't have any that day, I was also out of money
<user0> Oh no! That sounds horrible! Did the co-worker find out?
<user0> Oh wow. Give me the details.
<user1> Yea, as I pulled over I thought it was someone down on his luck. Nope, he was crazy.
<user0> Are you missing an organs?
<user1> Haha, it started off ok. He was going to the train station. I agreed to take him. With in minutes he was talking to him self. 
<user0> Well, At least you're in one piece. you could have been in several.
<user0> Not really? How come?
<user1> Well, after about an hour I got up to pee. As I washed my hands I looked up and my face was covered with sauce. It looked like someone poured it on my face, 
<user0> Oh wow, the BBQ must be delicious.
<user1> yea, I will not see here again but I will be seeing the BBQ again this weekend. 
<user1> That's a profound thought. We definitely take America for granted, especially when some people say it's in its "worst state in a long time." We're prisoners of the moment.
<user0> Those that criticize have not traveled the real world out side resort gates or into the third world. Then you see a real state that is in trouble.
<user1> Yeah, I guess you would know for sure, since you've seen it first hand. Especially a place like Haiti, that's just gets pounded with hurricanes. What brought you to Haiti, if you don't mind me asking?
<user0> I travel a lot. My self and my wife try to see 2-3 new cultures a year. 
<user0> I am sorry to hear that.Is there a chance you forgot your wallet home?
<user1> No it was stolen. So when I went to reach for it. The homeless man could tell something was wrong. He actually paid for my train ticket home. I end up seeing him again today. Took him out to lunch and gave him some money.
<user0> That story could become a movie script.
<user1> I really want to help him get his life together. 
<user1> That’s a bummer. Drink some coffee
<user0> Coffee dose even phase me anymore. The lack of sleep is making my soul sad.
<user1> Try drinking a lot of water and cutting out soda
<user0> I'll try that. 
<user0> Is it not going to happen?
<user1> Nope, my boss who only works one weekend a month has decided this month she is not going to work any weekends.
<user0> That sucks. 
<user1> Yea, she is not a very good boss and now I'm super bummed. 
<user0> You should find another job. No use being miserable. Or tell her boss!
<user0> What's ELS?
<user1> Sorry, ESL. It's English as a Second Language. It just means I am certified to teach students that don't speak fluent English.
<user0> Ah, gotcha. A few of my friends teach English to Chinese students online and I think they have taken ESL courses
<user0> That really sucks! What do you have to do?
<user1> I'm just using Raid right now, but I will call an exterminator tomorrow. I hate bugs so I am freaking out a little bit.
<user0> I do too.  I am so sorry you are going through this
<user0> Wow. I had that DVD.
<user1> I used to watch it in music class a lot. I am fascinated by the way they make music with everyday items.
<user0> I know. I wonder if they still do that show
<user1> This was just a few years ago, so hopefully.
<user1> Some dads are cool like that. My mom is that way sometimes.
<user0> I was shocked. I was fully prepared to pay the full thing. He's great.
<user1> I just went on a trip with my mom and sh paid for almost everything
<user1> Are you a busdriver?
<user0> no i ride a bus to work. this has happened twice in the past month. i need to get a car
<user1> Ah, gotcha. I hate it when things happen out of our control. Hope you get it figured out
<user1> Hi what you got going on?
<user0> Uhm.. just feeling blue. My gf broke up with me recently and got married to an investment banker
<user1> That is really sad.  Are you alright?
<user0> i guess so.. i mean, we were the same age. This guy was like 5-6 years elder, so ahead of me in life. i tried convincing her to give me a bit more time.. well.
<user0> I'm sorry.  Will you be able to pass this semester/
<user1> I am doing my best to pass
<user0> I'm sure it will happen.
<user0> I am sure you will do well!
<user1> Yes, i have prepared for two months now
<user0> I don't think you will need to worry then.
<user0> Sorry to hear that. Why did they not attend?
<user1> he was at work 
<user0> Hopefully your friend can make it up to you and hang out with you some time soon.
<user0> Ha, hope you aren't too scarred about being all by yourself.
<user1> i am scared, especially at night
<user0> Watching too many horror movies I bet. Just put on some comedy special.
<user0> That's quite an accomplishment. You must have worked very hard.
<user1> I was homeless for about a year.  It felt like every day I would just descened even further.  But I always held out hope that things would get better.
<user0> That must have been a very hard time. Your persistence led you to this success because you never gave up that hope.
<user1> Well there was a little luck in there as well.  I certainly feel a little blssed by my current situation.
<user1> That's very good. It takes a disciplined person to save money
<user0> Heh, well I didn't exactly save money that mush.  I just hunkered down and started working harder and asked for more hours.
<user1> You truely are determined to get that car, what brand is it?
<user0> It's a Kia Soul.  I hope to trade it in someday to cover the down payment on an electric car.
<user0> I hope you pass your exam. Did you do good at your exam?
<user1> yes, i always read hard
<user0> Good luck
<user0> Really? What happened? 
<user1> I found my old elementary school.  I hear it was going to be torn down next month, so I toured the inside.
<user0> Wow, cool! Did they let you in? It's so cool you had that opportunity.
<user1> Yeah.  It was mostly abandoned anyway.  Memeories filled my head anyway and I found myself in the past again.
<user1> Ick. I've never heard of anyone having a really good experience with that.
<user0> Well I realzied that the owner had taken the pictures of the car from a large distance.  Up close it was very disappointing.
<user1> Ah, I see. The classic photo trick. I understand why you would be upset about that. That's definitly why it's so important to go see before you buy
<user0> Well I know I won't be buying anything from that place!
<user0> Hi, tell me what's going on with you?
<user1> not going.hoe are u?
<user0> Oh, I'm well thank you.
<user1> its ok ya
<user1> Oh really? Any reason why?
<user0> Yeah I was buying something in electronics and this guy shows up out of nowhere and starts criticizing my purchase!
<user1> Wow really? That's pretty rude and bad in general for an employee to be doing.
<user0> That's the thing!  It wasn't an employee, it was another customer!
<user0> Do tell
<user1> I saw a bear crossing the road a mile from my job.
<user0> That's neat! I've only seen ducks and chickens. A deer did bounce over my car once, though
<user1> Yet it really shocked me.  But he just ran off, so not much excitement.
<user1> I guess it didn't turn out well?
<user0> No man it was GREAT.  I finally got my first paycheck after my rasie!
<user1> oh.  SWEET!  Congrats!  What are you going to do with all that money??
<user0> Well I was gonna buy a few video games, but I'll of course set some aside.  No need to go crazy.
<user1> Save it for Spider-Man that comes out next month!  I can't wait for that
<user0> Thinking about it!  But  I may not have to, as by then I'll get another paycheck at this pay grade!
<user1> And more to come hopefully!  Don't forget to save for retirement and/or emergency fund :D
<user1> Hello
<user0> how are you?
<user1> Am doing well thanks and you?
<user0> fine ya.thank you
<user0> hi
<user1> how are you?
<user0> fine. But, I think you're suppose to do the prompts, so hope it doesn't cause you a rejection.
<user1> not for the rejections
<user1> What have your experiences been like?
<user0> so nice my experience.
<user1> That's good to hear! Hope that it continues that way.
<user0> yes
<user0> Oh I hate that. Is it a high interest rate?
<user1> yes, it is exorbitant just to say
<user0> It's highway robbery. Well I can only hope you can pay it quickly to avoid as much of that as possible.
<user0> You read
<user1> I do read a lot of articles.
<user0> That's great , sorry for the error and unrelated message previously sent :) but you do have great friend that are dependable
<user1> Yes, he's one of my best friends and I really appreciated the help.  He's like a brother to me.  And it's okay about the error.
<user1> Oh my god, that must have been so embarrasing! Was there actually a fire?
<user0> Nope, it turned out to be a fire drill.  Everyone was laughing at me.  It wasn't one of my prouder moments.
<user1> Its okay, at least now you can look back at it as a funny moment.
<user1> Oh no, I hate having connectivity problems! Are you having bad weather?
<user0> Yep its raining cats and dogs in here.
<user1> Oh, it has been raining here a lot too. I will keep my fingers crossed that your wi-fi keeps working!
<user1> Yes, I am here
<user0> Yes, I had fully charged it and after like 6-7 rides it had 3% left.
<user1> Oh no, I bet that was stressful. What did you do?
<user0> Well, I called the very last customer and made sure he only was traveling like 5-6 miles and that the system wouldn't die. It worked out.
<user0> I like my alone time too. What do you enjoy doing by yourself?
<user1> I just love people watch, if that's considered alone time.
<user0> Oh that's is fun. It's a way to be alone with your thoughts, but still be around others. I love to watch people! 
<user0> Yes I can related to that feeling
<user1> I don't think people realize iportance of that in their life.
<user0> Well, a great morning leads to a great day 
<user0> Which movie did you watch?
<user1> lost 
<user0> That is a very scary movie! How are you coping?
<user0> What was hurtful may I ask?
<user1> Well, they made me leave everything at my desk, walked me downstairs, turn in my badge, and would mail my belonings.
<user0> That sounds like very bad treatment, You should sue them
<user1> Yah, I feel like it. Thanks for understanding.
<user1> Maybe you haven't done anything terribly wrong that anyone would feel remorseful about. Do you think that's it?
<user0> I think it might just be a stage in life.
<user1> Maybe. It's none of my business but sometimes when people feel this way, they could be experiencing depression. 
<user1> I suppose it is.
<user0> Than I will go on feeling this way I guess, or do I have another option?
<user1> You always have options!
<user1> Sounds like someone who is actually not a friend. How long have you known her?
<user0> I have known her less than a year.
<user1> I used to work with a girl like that. She always talked bad about me but was nice to my face.
<user0> Yah, I can't stand when that happens. Just so wrong.
<user0> I can't say that I really do. It's always a mystery in my mind.
<user1> Or is the sign of overconfidence, like they say, -  there are two types of bikes, those that were in an accident, and those that will be?
<user0> I believe I see it more as that type. No one can truly know.
<user0> I know what you mean. Wednesdays there's this market I like to go to, but lately it just has so much rotten food
<user1> Yet there's still something about that imperfection, do you agree?
<user0> Totally. I still love to go have a look around
<user0> Yes, it is partially true. What is the problem?
<user1> There aren't any, I am just drawing a conclusion from past experience. 
<user0> I understand.
<user0> That is very true. Did something bad happen to you?
<user1> Nothing major, but I am still learning how to deal with such behavior and always open for an advice. 
<user0> Generally just try to ignore it as best as you can. I'm good about just letting things roll off my back.
<user0> Oh no! Those can be difficult to spot sometimes.
<user1> yes exactly , but i also had my 4 6 month old 11 month old baby with me .
<user0> Wow. That must have been stressful. I have babies, too. Did they understand?
<user1> ya after they had seen my 11 month old baby with me they felt they should not trouble me by towing away car . i felt very thankful to them
<user0> That is a relief. Sounds like you made it just in time.
<user1> yes some people are very understanding and helpful
<user1> I get it. Sometimes I feel stressed out for no real reason myself.
<user0> i ordered some semi expensive tablet yesterday so maybe its that but like, i cant think of a logical reason why that would go wrong so im left wondering why i feel so nervous, its really weird, very hard to relax like this
<user1> Well sometimes companies make mistakes. I doubt it's anything you did.
<user1> I think it's very common that we take things for granted. 
<user0> Is there anything that can change that?
<user1> I think you can really think about all that you have, and show your thanks that you have these things. 
<user1> What was depressing?
<user0> Well, just really did a lot of housework and felt we lost contact.
<user1> Oh, that sounds like a bummer. Do you think it will change?
<user0> Yes, it got so much better the next few days.
<user0> What is the name of the show?
<user1> It was called Hero's
<user0> No, I ever did.
<user1> it was actually quite good
<user1> why hasnt it already been returned?
<user0> They said it takes up to 30 days, and it's only been a few weeks.
<user1> if you live in america and they fail to return it in a timely manner, i hear you can go to small claims and get 3x the amount awarded to you 
<user0> Wow, that's good to know.
<user1> yeah r/legaladvice has a lot of posts like that so its something that stuck to me, Pretty neat to know that landlords cant just scam you
<user1> That's cool. I've always been a Mac kind of girl, but I would look into a Surface is I was in the market for a new computer.
<user0> i only ever wanted one cause they can do the same stuff a regular computer can but also touch screen so you can draw on it, i always got discouraged drawing on paper cause id waste so much of it, and then just stop
<user1> I get that. I got a bamboo tablet a few years ago, but I feel like working directly on the screen would be even better.
<user1> what was ?
<user0> Spending time watching TV and sipping wine together.
<user1> oh that does sound nice
<user0> Do you like wine?
<user0> Well in some ways solitude is nice.
<user1> Yes if you take it in portions. 
<user0> True everything is nice in bits. Too much of anything does get tiring.
<user0> Be responsible about what?
<user1> Well, about getting daily chorses done--work first-- play later.
<user0> I understand. I have to get work around my house done today too, before I can go out.
<user1> Yes, it teaches us self-pride.
<user1> Oh no, sorry to hear, hope you are OK.
<user0> I'm fine, but they left a nasty dent in the front of my car. Now I have to get it fixed, which is a hassle.
<user1> I agree. Hope the car will look good again.
<user1> Sorry to hear that. Did you try to talk to a friend?
<user0> friends are cool but its not quite the same as a family member, a spouse would be but i dont have that either!
<user1> I understand
<user1> I agree, where did you find them?
<user0> LOL, mixed up in my drawer.
<user1> Oh I see, Ha! I would have just worn them like that to be more fashionable!
<user0> Yes, funny.
<user0> Was it an accident?
<user1> no the boulders fell 50 meters infront of me , luckily i was going slow and suddenly stopped
<user0> Oh ! Thank good ness! That was close
<user1> yes but i am so much worried for what happened that night
<user1> do you especially enjoy macadamia nuts or just eating?
<user0> It the only nut that I can eat, that's why I can't help overeating.
<user1> It must be difficult living with a nut allergy. Do you overeat on macadamia nuts regularly?
<user1> It's awful out there. It's been in the 100's here in TX
<user0> oh no, texas is basically in a desert isnt it. for me on top of heat i also get some 3 wasps a day flying into my apartament and looking around, i just got one earlier and had to kill it to get rid of it. very annoying, apparently wasps love it though
<user1> That sucks! I hate wasps and most other bugs, so I feel your annoyance.
<user0> spiders are really the worst, thankfully it looks like the heat was useful for Something at least and killed them off
<user0> what job did you apply to?
<user1> I'm a teacher, so I've been off this summer. I am looking forward to having 12th graders again this year.
<user0> Somehow i suspect that theyre not looking forward to having you though :P (no offence) i cant remember anyone that enjoyed high school lol. Its a good job though! literally backbone of society
<user1> Haha, true. I try to make it a little more enjoyable for them, but I've also been in their shoes.
<user1> Yeah that's always comforting.  Mom's are awesome
<user0> Do you ever disagree with your Mom?
<user1> Not really.  We usually tend to think alike.  Why do you ask?  
<user0> Aww, I didn't really relate until I had children of my own
<user1> Cool.  So you're the awesome mother here?
<user0> We both are.
<user0> I'm sorry to hear that
<user1> yeah well. what you gonna do.. thats life..
<user0> :( did you stay friends with him?
<user1> hell no.. i could never look at him again
<user1> did you get admission? 
<user0> yeah i thought the competition was tough and i may not get admitted, but luckily i was admitted
<user1> That's great news, well done. 
<user0> yes i am totally relived of that stress now
<user1> :) 
<user1> Me too, especially when it's still the middle of the day.
<user0> or in the case here, morning
<user1> Oh yes, you're right. I'm in the same boat right now!
<user0> I just need six good hours of sleep
<user0> I think I am missing something, you said you feel more that ok after 3 pizzas???
<user1> yeah i know right, a lot, and i am pretty thin so i shouldnt feel ok, But i totally do feel great .
<user0> It's definitely some kind of anomaly. 
<user1> i think you just dont appreciate how good pizza is
<user1> What did you eat there? 
<user0> Onion soup with croutons.
<user1> ooooh onion soup sounds really good, onions do taste incredibly well if cooked well with the correct dish
<user1> I would have flipped and never talked to him again. I am so sorry my god what did you do? 
<user0> what else can i do? i washed my kid clean and got the hell out of there
<user1> Idk beat him up, lol. throw a drink at him, the sky is the limit! 
<user1> cool, how did it come by?
<user0> I'm happy with it. Hopefully my students like it too.
<user1> if you put so much work into it, im sure they will
<user1> I am so sorry! I would have a hard time forgiving that betrayal of trust. How long have you been together?
<user0> 3 years
<user1> Wow. I hope that you can work it out, but I would understand why you wouldn't want to.
<user1> really? well, who doesnt!
<user0> true.. there is something about that holiday that makes us wanna be kids again
<user1> i actually feel like a kid even now during christmas
<user1> wow, what was it?
<user0> a brand new ford car, i was thrilled
<user1> woohoo! you are one lucky child!
<user1> No way! I just moved from NY to FL. You are going to love NY tho, its an awesome state. Congrats on the job! 
<user0> thank you so much.. i moved from Idaho.. so this is very new to me, all this
<user1> Oh yeah sounds like its super new to you especially if you are in the city. I was in the middle of no where so pretty much felt like Idaho where I lived in NY. :p 
<user1> I would too why would she not tell you!? Did yall break up? 
<user0> we had a fight, i never knew we were broken up though
<user1> That sounds like poor communication on her part maybe its better for you she moved. :/ 
<user1> What incident was that ?
<user0> i was driving home and it started to rain
<user1> what happened then ?
<user0> my tire went out and was going to call fro help. I didn't get a chance to call.
<user0> I know what you mean, it sucks when those "dates" linger over us even if we try not to think about them. Im so sorry to hear that! 
<user1> yeah.. i know it is time to get over it. but certain memories are so haunting
<user0> Its not time to get over it, you arent doing any wrong its okay to "feel" things. I hope people around you give you a lot of love! 
<user0> i understand what you are saying, pets are always close to our hearts
<user1> very true, do you have any pets?
<user0> yeah, i have 2 german shepards
<user0> is it a scary movie?
<user1> it is a terrifying movie. havent you seen it yet?
<user0> no i never heard of it
<user0> yea thats probably the best choice to make
<user1> i always think all those hard times they had bringing me up
<user0> i can understand that
<user0> Yuck, that is terrible. I would be grossed out too. What did you do?
<user1> i got the hell out of there right away!
<user0> I'm sure you did. Guess he couldn't make it to the trash can.
<user0> oh thats really sweet!
<user1> Yeah, it made me sad to see it because they I live so far away now.
<user0> oh no.. i hope you feel better
<user0> Those are great aren'
<user1> do you have a large family?
<user0> Sorry(Those are great aren't they?) I do not but we always had sunday breakfast for many years. Those memories are to be cherished and repeated :)
<user0> wow that is a lot to take in.  get a muzzle
<user1> I'm not bothered by him barking.  As someone who watches a lot of scary movies it is more of a worry factor that someone is down there than anything.
<user0> i can understand that
<user0> Do you think it was the right decision?
<user1> Definitely, my company always treat's me right. They haven't gave me a reason to want to leave. 
<user0> That's great. Maybe you will get a raise too
<user0> why is that
<user1> because there were soda cans rolling all around the parking lot and i was scrambling to pick them all up
<user0> oh i can understand that
<user0> That must have been terrifying
<user1> It was, the whole time I was shaking and breathing heavily.
<user0> I don't know what I would have done
<user0> Awesome! What kind of dog is Lola?
<user1> She's a Pekingese. When they handed me the trophy I just couldn't stop smiling. She's the best dog I could ask for.
<user0> I don't think I would have been able to stop smiling either! That is so awesome!
<user0> That's nice, is she technologically savvy?
<user1> not really but she tries haha
<user0> Well it's nice she's making the effort!
<user0> I do too. I have a box filled with them. How old is your oldest?
<user1> i have some old ones from the korean war
<user0> wow!
<user0> That's good. Now you don't have to worry about it.
<user1> That is true! I also have his outfit picked out for the first day of school.
<user0> Wow, your son is lucky to have a parent who is on top of things!
<user0> What did you bet?
<user1> I bet him $1000 because that's how good I am. I had no doubt in my mind I could win. I ended up obliterating him and taking his shoes too.
<user0> That would be awesome! Did your cousin pay you?
<user0> Oh no, I am sorry to hear that. I hope she is okay.
<user1> me too, she has heart problems unfortunately
<user0> I am so sorry. I hope she is able to get some relief and rest.
<user1> thank you i appreciate the kind words
<user1> Oh man! That must have been great to hear! What did he say?
<user0> He said poop. When I heard It I jumped up with joy. That's my boy!
<user1> That's so funny! That's one of those things you will definitely remember forever!
<user1> Oh I can understand that! I would also like to be outside; it looks like such a beautiful day! At least it is almost the weekend!
<user0> thats true, i'll be outside in an hour or less!
<user1> That's great! Are you going to join your friends at the park?
<user1> You should have taken a flashlight just in case. 
<user0> I was gonna use my phone but it died, so I just sprinted for like half an hour.
<user1> hey at least you got a nice workout in!
<user0> Yeah way to look at it positive lol. There was a river nearby so at least it sounded kind of relaxing.
<user1> That is true. Well I'm glad you made it home safely. Maybe next time maybe go a little earlier before it gets so dark out.
<user0> For sure, or at least charge my phone haha. Thx I'm glad I didnt get mauled by a bear too
<user0> I had ice cream too! Sorry you got sick
<user1> its my own fault i went past my limit lol
<user0> Ha, at least it was good
<user0> Thats always fun! Does your pup do well with other dogs?
<user1> Yeah he is a golden so he is happy no matter what lol. He will go up to people and not leave until they pet him.
<user0> Mine does the same thing. Goldens are so adorable.
<user1> Absolutely! What kind of dog do you have?
<user0> He is just a mix breed. We really don't even know.
<user1> Mixed breeds usually look really cool.
<user1> lol, it happens to us all
<user0> Yea you cant help but feel like a stupid little kid or something, at least I did lol.
<user1> haha true
<user0> Got any crazy drinking stories?
<user0> That sucks did you need to return something?
<user1> yes some printer ink
<user0> That stuff is pretty expensive. Maybe you can sell it on eBay or something.
<user0> Oh wow! I would have been so disgusted and outraged! What did you do?
<user1> Well I didn't want to start a fight or anything, so I just took it off and held my nose the rest of the ride. Then I washed it like 6 times lol
<user0> That must have been a terrible experience. I'm not sure that I would be able to wear that jacket again.
<user1> I wouldnt have but it was a pretty expensive northface I had for many years.
<user1> i hope you do really well
<user0> Thanks anything youre looking forward to?
<user1> going to see some old friends this weekend
<user0> Cool when was the last time you saw them?
<user0> Good job what did you work hard on?
<user1> my job and at the gym
<user0> Nice keep it up!
<user0> That is awesome!  What are you studying
<user1> Ya thanks it's mechanical engineering I have 2 years left.
<user0> was it hard to go back or are you enjoying it?
<user1> Oh I am going back in a few weeks. It will probably be hard but I will enjoy it for sure.
<user0> Well good luck!  I am sure you will do great!
<user1> Thank you! I sure hope so.
<user1> I do like the rain though
<user0> It is relaxing, the only thing is that you can't do anything outside really. Had some plans but they got canceled.
<user1> I am sure you will have plans again
<user0> That's true, it's good to look forward to the future.
<user1> Yeah, I am sure it will be fine
<user0> Yeah did you do anything exciting last weeked?
<user0> I would have been to. I always wonder how people make the money necessary to buy vehicles like that.
<user1> Yeah I am thinking this guy must be a CEO or something. If I had the money I would buy one for sure.
<user0> Same here. I saw a Ferrari at the supermarket the other day. I was jealous, and I also thought about how I would be worried something would happen to it (if it were mine).
<user1> Yeah I guess if something happened you are probably rich enough to just buy another lol.
<user1> I take you don't have issued with you weight.
<user0> No, I just did it because nobody thought I could.
<user1> Ok, then.If it was a 1 thing only, no problem.
<user1> Is he acting creepy at all? 
<user0> It's getting to that point. I wish he would just stop. I have enough friends already.
<user1> Have you tried to talk to him at all and see what his deal is?
<user1> That's good you have well-behaved dogs, did you train them?
<user0> Not on purpose, but they have learned from right and wrong from me
<user1> Well it's good you're doing something right.
<user0> Do you have pets
<user0> Oh no! What did you do to bring yourself down? (from the panic attack)
<user1> I had to cover my head with a blanket, and picture myself somewhere else. That's how bad it was.
<user0> I'm sorry. That sounds bad. Flying always makes me nervous but I usually make it ok.
<user0> Well we are friends aren't we? I do appreciate you as one.
<user1> Thanks. In my mom's group, I feel like a lot of the moms are friends but I'm not friends with any of them.
<user0> You wanna maybe go to the bar with my other friends this weekend? They will probably like you. Tim likes some things you do.
<user1> That sounds nice, I just need to connect with someone.
<user1> Oh i hate it when i get those kind of thoughts but eventually you recover and don't think about it.
<user0> I hope so. I am driving and I just get so scared. 
<user1> Just relax more you got this and it was just a fender bender.
<user1> Naptime is a good thing though isnt it
<user0> It is but he threw a huge temper tantrum at naptime. 
<user1> Well that is never good
<user1> That doesnt sound too fun
<user0> I read it when he got home and alot of his responses involved mommy said a bad word!
<user1> Oh wow, the kid is a snitch
<user1> It happens, everyone does it
<user0> yeah thats true, not the end of the world;
<user1> I am sure you will fix it
<user1> Have you spoken to him about it?
<user0> nope its happening right now
<user1> Are you going to do anything about it in the future?
<user1> congratulations im glad, hopefully you will like it more than your last job
<user0> It turned out to be better than my last one for the most part
<user1> im glad to hear that
<user1> what kind of pizza?
<user0> Bacon and sausage pizza.  Unfortunately, it also had a cockroach crawling across it when I picked it up
<user1> what!! i hope u got your money back
<user1> Why's that?
<user0> it was over 100 degrees outside and i was low on antifreeze
<user1> Did your car end up overheating?
<user1> Thats great! But what did they do that you didn't like?
<user0> He and I never got along, seemed like he tried to sabotage me
<user1> Well looks like that didn't work out for him in the end. What finally got him axed?
<user1> Did you replace it?
<user0> not yet im still looking for it
<user1> Do you think he'll get angry?
<user1> did you start walking faster?
<user0> Yeah, tried to get out of there
<user1> hopefully you made it out safely
<user1> That is good to hear. What happened that made you think so?
<user0> They always holding hands and smiling
<user1> Oh ok. That sounds like they really get along well. It is nice to have good neighbors.
<user0> Yes it is , so far
<user0> Oh no!  Was he OK?  I hope it was nothing serious!
<user1> no he has already been released thankfully
<user0> That's good to know!  You all have a lot to be thankful for!
<user0> I would hope so too or else the relationship would be awkward.
<user1> Yes thats true, to say the least
<user0> I hope it wasn't too much money just in case.
<user1> Around 30, but ive know him a while
<user1> What you you have planned?
<user0> nothing! thats why im excited lol
<user1> Really?? It sounds like there was something going on.
<user1> Oh that's never a good situation. It happens to the best of us though. I need to clean my fridge
<user0> I put it off too long this time. It was pretty stinky, my dogs thought I was nuts for throwing food away. 
<user1> I'm sure they were thinking waste not, want not. haha
<user1> Oh yeah? Find anything interesting?
<user0> It made me think about how far I've come since.  I also felt like I was in a different time and place reading them
<user1> Ah, nothing quite like that feeling. I remember when I was on the school newspaper. Good times.
<user1> Are you going, too?
<user0> They didn't invite me for some reason
<user1> Oh no, that sucks. Would you have wanted to go though?
<user1> Well, that's not cool.
<user0> I wish he'd pick up after himself
<user1> Does he do that stuff often?
<user1> Oh? What kind of project?
<user0> Presentation, a co-worker came in and helped me out
<user1> Oh that's nice of them! 
<user1> That's good, do you get paid over time?
<user0> Yeah, I would like for my boss to notice and promote me at some point
<user1> I think if you keep it up you'll get the recognition you want soon.
<user1> Was everything okay? What were they doing?
<user0> I ended up turning around, who knows what they were up to
<user1> True, you never know these days.
<user1> Is your phone waterproof?
<user0> My case was, as the phone still worked
<user1> You are so lucky! My phone would have been done...
<user1> That's great! Are you seeing results?
<user0> Absolutely, I feel so much better too
<user1> I bought a spin bike but I haven't used it yet
<user1> Maybe they were left for you.
<user0> I think he meant to save them
<user1> He can't save them out in the open. What kind were they?
<user1> Did he get it back? I hate it when that happens...
<user0> I went back and grabbed it for him
<user1> You are a true friend indeed. I bet he is very appreciative!
<user1> Did he eventually find one?
<user0> After months of work, he at least got an interview
<user1> That is making progress.
<user1> Congratulations!  What do you plan on doing?
<user0> Next stop is hopefully pharmacy school. Okay, maybe not completely done.
<user1> That is a great goal to set for yourself.
<user0> Thank you. I'm really excited!
<user0> I am sorry to hear that. I hope the results will be good.
<user1> I got them back yesterday, and it was good news.  No cancer!
<user0> It is good new.
<user1> Yes, it was really good news.  I have a profound sense of relief.
<user1> Was it an intruder?
<user0> No, it was my drunk cousin, lol.  She had tried knocking and we didn't hear her.
<user1> What a surprise haha
<user0> Yes, it was a bit scary at first, but then funny.
<user0> I did too. Did you go out last night?
<user1> nope lol i just stayed up late
<user0> Well I stayed up late too. Drinking beer and playing vidos games lol
<user0> Holy goodness! That's so cool. What will you do there?
<user1> I will help design the new iphones. It's going to be so much fun!
<user0> Oh my god! That's something to be proud of, congrats!
<user0> I am sorry you are feeling like this.  Maybe you should reach out to someone
<user1> It's like they only call me when they need something. The only friend I have is myself.
<user0> I am sorry that you are going through this
<user0> Oh wow, now that's funny! I've only been on one roller coaster and it was rather small, but I loved it!
<user1> This roller coaster was one of the biggest in the world and i'm not good with heights.
<user0> Oh wow! I'd love to go on a much larger coaster than the one I road. But it might be scarier than I imagine.
<user0> How old is he?
<user1> 8!
<user0> They are still cute at this age and they make a lot of progress.
<user0> Oh no! Well hopefully she wasn't too upset, then you'll know how her character is :)
<user1> She hasn't returned any of my calls. I feel horrible.
<user0> Oh no! Well, honestly if she can't deal with one mistake, then it's no good anyhow. But maybe it was something else. Sometimes people just don't click.
<user0> I feel you! I don't like to perform in front of people either. Did you decline?
<user1> No, I ended up going through with it. I was worried that they would boo me at first because my singing is horrible, but I guess everyone was too drunk to care.
<user0> Oh you can be as bad as you want there, it just matters if you're having fun :)
<user0> Wow , i bet it was a long day of moving, but i can imagine the joy you must feel inside you, congratulations !!!!
<user1> Thanks. I did it all by myself too. All that saving finally paid off!
<user0> I used to move furniture for my old job, so i bet it was a lot of heavy lifting, its so exciting to finally have your own place
<user0> I hope you do! What is the test on?
<user1> chemistry!
<user0> Oh man. That was a difficult subject for me after Physics. Are you a science major?
<user0> I understand how lonely it can be when your schedule doesn't fit with your old friends.
<user1> yeah true but i cant blame them
<user0> You can make new friends. Its just part of the human experience. Everything is temporary
<user0> Oh no. I am so sorry to hear that!
<user1> thank you. he was the sweetest thing.
<user0> Dogs are with us for such a short amount of time. Kinda wish they lived as long as us.
<user1> that would be great. but i guess that is what makes them so special. you don't get to have them long.
<user1> Friends can be so awesome!
<user0> i definitely agree
<user1> What did they help you with?
<user1> I'm sorry to hear that. Where did they go?
<user0> Mexico. I had to work.
<user1> Oh man, Sometimes it's hard to strike that work life balance.
<user1> Who is the interview with?
<user0> a possible employer
<user1> Are you going to wear a suit?
<user1> War would be terrifying. What makes you think we will?
<user0> just general unrest and instability globally
<user1> Yea. Seems to be more of that lately.
<user1> What have they been doing?
<user0> just generally driving poorly and not using signals
<user1> Do you honk at them?
<user1> Wow. He must be really strong! Why'd he lift the car?
<user0> it was a strong man contest.  he wasn't that big either, just really strong.
<user1> Oh I've heard of those contests. Must be exciting to see.
<user0> yes it was.  i was just so impressed because he was the smallest guy there but no one else could lift it.
<user0> What is the protest for?
<user1> free speech
<user0> What happened? Why were they being limited?
<user0> They do love to surprise ya, don't they?
<user1> yes! i don't kill them if i don't have to.  they eat bugs.
<user0> Interesting. I didn't know that. So did you end up taking it outside?
<user1> i just moved it out of the bathtub. i relocated him temporarily 
<user1> Family time is so precious. Are your kids still with you?
<user0> no they are grown.  they are in their twenties now, i miss them.
<user1> They grow up so fast sometimes.
<user0> yes indeed, but i can look forward to grand kids
<user0> I'm so sorry to hear that!
<user1> i was crushed, didn't even see it coming.
<user0> Did they say why?
<user1> yes they said they didn't have any work for me.
<user1> Why do you say that?
<user0> it was so much easier then.  no responsibilities.
<user1> Yea, I totally get ya on that.
<user0> everything was just easier
<user0> Man, are you me? People been annoying lately?
<user1> Yes!! Try to walk through walmart, people are so rude! 
<user0> Here I was hoping a Walmart would open in my area. Guess it's a good thing there isn't one.
<user1> You would be better off with a costco.
<user1> Oh which Disney? Sounds exciting!
<user0> disney world! this will be my 6th time.
<user1> What's your favorite thing to do there?
<user0> Epcot! I love visiting the different nations.
<user0> That would make me so mad!  What did you do?
<user1> i called the police and my insurance company.  people just have no respect.
<user0> Yeah, It bothers me when people don't take responsibility for their actions.
<user1> they were probably on heroine or something
<user1> Lol. Why didn't she tell you?
<user0> I don't know. She was strange. I did not notice until I went to the restroom right before I left. 
<user1> So you're not gonna see her again?
<user0> She text me today but I'm not interested. She was beautiful but not very smart at all.
<user1> Gotta have brains
<user1> Why did you stop?
<user0> To show my self I had self control. I was drinking like 5 cups a day.
<user1> Wow. I drink Dr Pepper like coffee.
<user0> Today as soon as my lips touched the cup. I felt my soul smile.
<user1> I bet. I get that feeling every morning with a Dr Pepper
<user1> Why would you have twenty dollars on the desk
<user0> For the vending machine at lunch. I lock my wallet up took 20 out put on my desk. Had to run to the bathroom. Came back and it was gone. I share my office with no one.
<user1> OH. Thats terrible.
<user1> Tots?
<user0> totally 
<user1> Congratulations on your hair.
<user0> First hair cut in a year. Made me feel like a new man. 
<user0> where is that
<user1> I've been there sometime age, it's in Ukraine, Kiev.
<user0> oh id love to visit there one day when its a more stable area
<user0> I know! It's almost an unexplainable feeling isn't it?
<user1> Yes, It is so hard to describe honestly!
<user0> But it is also the best feeling ever! Enjoy every moment!
<user1> Thank you! It is hard at times tho when getting little sleep.
<user0> Best advice I ever got was that housework can wait and take naps whenever you cam when the baby sleeps!
<user0> What did you almost buy?
<user1> I saw this great used car in a print ad, and went to the dealership, but when I got there, it was all ratty and crappy looking!
<user0> Ah, yea, I've had the once or twice. When you buy used you have to go in with the mindset of haggle down, find a decent one, or leave
<user1> The guy used an old picture of the car to fool me!  What a jerk!
<user1> I love heavy rain, it just really soothes me.
<user0> Yes, the sound that it makes when the windows are open...
<user1> I know! Also the thunder is so cool to listen to.
<user1> I did a research on a cancer vaccine  
<user0> Well I meant my mood, not my health in general.
<user1> Oh sorry for the mix up
<user1> What happened to you?
<user0> That's a thing, nothing really, I guess I just relaxed for a bit.
<user1> OK. I hope you are now fine?
<user1> Never. I hate cats personally
<user0> How about, dogs?
<user1> I've come to hate them too unfortunately. Constant noise
<user1> Oh, that's so sad. What earthquake?
<user0> It was a 8.6 I believe, but it happened like 2 years ago.
<user1> Oh, that's a big one. I bet it caused a lot of damage
<user1> Aw that's so sad! Did you help it?
<user0> I didn't, I don't know why, maybe because I hate ticks.
<user1> I guess that's fair, but I probably would've taken it to the vet.
<user1> Me neither. It's why I hate living in London
<user0> Oh I don't know how you guys do it, you must have artificial sun at home?
<user1> Nope. We just remain miserable year round
<user1> Music can be so touching to the soul.
<user0> Yes, especially when you don't expect it to be.
<user1> Who was the artist of the song?
<user1> I like incense. Did you find the cause of the bad odor?
<user0> Yes, it some plumbing problems. 
<user1> Oh well I hope you can fix it soon
<user1> What made you realize that? You can't live in fear
<user0> Yes, but if you don't run away from it, there wont be any fear.
<user1> It's good to face your fears
<user1> Oh was it a bad or naughty thought?
<user0> It was a crazy though actually, but thank god I didn't act on it.
<user1> What was it? Was it really that crazy?
<user1> I think that happen in a lot of families.
<user0> Yes, you are right, but we still need to forgive.
<user1> I understand. You were the only one getting hit?
<user1> ooh my God he hurt himself
<user0> Thankfully he did not. The tree was uprooted and the car really got damaged as well.
<user1> so bad i can imagine that loose he made to you
<user1> how was it ?
<user0> It was really scary!
<user1> wow i can only imagine
<user1> thats a good thought to have
<user0> Yeah, i mean.. We are all the children of the same nation.. time to stop the fight.
<user1> i totally agree with that
<user1> oh nice
<user0> It was really awkward though.. i mean,what do you do at that moment!
<user1> wait til she leaves and continue
<user1> Sounds like an interesting job.  I'm sure it's taxing on the family though.
<user0> It is difficult feeling isolated.  I miss them a lot.
<user1> In the end is the trade off worth it?
<user0> I don't really know, to be honest.  It pays our bills, and it is fun work, but it is hard.
<user0> I am so jealous. He is one of my all time favorite actors. 
<user1> He is so charming and electrifying in person as well.. such a nice guy
<user0> Were you star struck?
<user0> Oh no.. what did you do?
<user1> i was grossed out! i rushed off there immediately
<user0> I would have done the same as well
<user0> Oh no.. I'm sure you did not feel great when you found out
<user1> I was extremely irritated actually
<user0> I would be too. Hopefully that gets resolved soon
<user0> That is exactly the way you are supposed to feel. Did you get the job?
<user1> Yeah, i got it!
<user0> Good for you! Congrats buddy
<user0> oh yea congrats.. what will you be doing
<user1> I will be handling the sales section of the firm. So excited about the future
<user0> that sounds like a good career
<user0> thats really cool. How did he react?
<user1> It is a girl actually, and she was really surprised as well.
<user0> This is such an awesome coincidence buddy
<user0> Oh yeah, i hear that it is really scary
<user1> It was. And i went at night, alone. Was such a bad idea
<user0> Oh no.. But it gave you such a memorable experience as well, right?
<user0> Oh so sorry to hear that.. what did you do?
<user1> I lodged a compliant. But a missed chance is missed itself
<user0> I hear you.. dont worry, things will be ok soon enough
<user0> I am sorry to hear that.  You weren't hurt were you?
<user1> I'm mostly okay. Just a little whiplash. I've never been in more than a fender bender before, so it was not a fun experience.
<user0> Were you at fault?
<user0> aww.. that is so sweet.. i bet every parent feel that way
<user1> true. i feel like they are my parents who were born as my kids
<user0> oh no.. i feel sorry for you buddyt
<user0> Oh wow. is it really as scary as the reviews say it is?
<user1> that and much more! Especially if you choose to go and watch it alone at night
<user0> Damn, sounds like such a stunning experience
<user0> I can image, that's pretty disgusting.  What your friend sick or drunk?
<user1> he was drunk out of his mind on whiskey.. i told him to cut back many times.. of well..
<user0> You can only do so much.  Next time I'd just let him drink on his own.
<user1> good for you my friend
<user1> Oh lord.. How did it happen?
<user0> We were at a party, he drank way too much and did it.
<user1> God.. That is really disgusting, yes
<user1> That sucks.  How long have you been a teacher for?
<user0> This will be my 4th year. I love it, but the beginning of the year is always pretty hectic.
<user1> Yeah I'd imagine.  The months off for summer is nice though.
<user1> Why would you do that?
<user0> I felt sorry for the person, she looked trustworthy. and she needed to pay for some medicines for a friend who had accident
<user1> So, why didn't you just pay for them your self?
<user1> Sorry to hear that.. Why were you alone?
<user0> I have just moved away from my family to a new city for work. so.
<user1> I hear you.. Socialize, get new friends.. You will start adapting
<user1> Oh dear lord.. Was he sick or something?
<user0> he was drunk actually, a lot
<user1> haha.. Sorry, i couldn't help but picturize it.
<user1> Oh no, what happened?
<user0> The cops pulled me over, i thought something was wrong
<user1> Holy.. What did they want?
<user1> I see.. Any specific reason for that?
<user0> I just like to be prepared and organized. Thats me.
<user1> It is really good to have that level of discipline
<user1> Same here.  It helps make cooking go smoother.
<user0> There is something so nice about being prepared fully
<user1> Agreed.  No sense wasting time while cooking by looking for odds and ends.
<user0> 5
<user0> i bet you did.. Felt nostalgic huh?
<user1> haha.. yeah. So much childhood packed into a room
<user0> that is really innocent and sweet of you my friend
<user0> Aww.. Did you used to go as a family to the beach?
<user1> Yeah.. We took off on the car, all our family and we used to make a whole day out of it
<user0> Such a sweet story.. So happy just to hear that from you
<user0> WOW!! She is my absolute favorite!
<user1> Mine too. She is a timeless beauty
<user0> So true.  I was so jealous of brad pitt over the years
<user0> Aw.. sorry about that my friend. Have you made any friends?
<user1> A few. I had moved away from my family for a job. Can't ever replace them, right?
<user0> So true.. family is everything!
<user0> Oh no, what did he do?
<user1> He cut animal shapes into it. When we were kids
<user0> Aww, you got to admit that is so cute as well
<user0> That is really sweet my friend. It is nice to see old friends
<user1> True! All those old memories started rushing in
<user0> Aw, i am missing my high school now that you said it
<user0> Haha. Do you love sports cars that much?
<user1> Oh yeah.. I collected pictures of all the sports cars out there as a child, growing up
<user0> Such passion for cars. Wish you can buy one soon mate
<user0> How much better did it pay?
<user1> 5k. But i am satisfied with my current firm
<user0> That is not too much, I think you made a good choice
<user0> Sorry to hear that my friend. Why did you move?
<user1> I got a new job in here, so.
<user0> I see.. Dont worry, you will own your new city soon enough
<user0> I am sorry to hear that, why did you move there?
<user1> thanks, you too
<user0> I am sorry to hear that, why did you move there?
<user1> 5
<user1> Did you end up buying anything?
<user0> yeah, i bought quite a lot stuff
<user1> Well is it close to where you live? That would be cool to go back often
<user1> that is a good tactic actually, it boosts your confidence
<user0> Yeah, and confidence is key in winning those right
<user1> Very true. We should believe in ourselves for others to do that
<user1> Oh my god, sorry to hear that my friend.. Were you guys close?
<user0> Yeah, very much. She was the one who looked after me.
<user1> How sad.. Find peace knowing that she is in heaven now
<user1> what did she get sick off , im sorry to hear that your a great to your wife
<user0> She caught a very bad cold. I brought her soup everyday and tended to her every need.
<user1> When i get married i want to be like you , and take care of my loved one 
<user1> That sounds tough.  How do you think you did?
<user0> Horrible, my palms were sweaty the entire time. I hate talking in front of large crowds.
<user1> Me, too--I'm sorrry you had to go through that.  At least it's over now, right?
<user1> Maybe they know a friend who knows a friend.
<user0> That's what i'm thinking, it's not what you know it's who you know.
<user1> Yep, that's the way of the world, especially with Universities to.
<user1> A duplicate? Like a fake?
<user0> yes i received a fake product , the make of earphones is very well known brand 
<user1> That  sucks.  I'd be very upset.      You have to be careful who you order from online.  Some times if the price is too goot to be true its a fake product.
<user0> yes that s true , i regularly buy online but this is the first time i experienced this.
<user0> Oh no that is so frustrating! What did you do?
<user1> Well I wanted to cry and scream, I was so cross with myself but unfortunately as I live alone I just had to drive the 40 minutes back to the office to get them then another 40mins back home.  Where i swiftly had a little glass of wine to help lol.
<user0> Ah yes, a glass of wine might help to make that feel better. Still, what a pain. Lousy end to a lousy day. 
<user1> Exactly, so irritating.  But hey you live and learn, I guarantee you I will never leave work again without double then triple checking that I have all my belongings with me!
<user0> I would be so lost without my phone, but I could make it through an evening. The house keys though! 
<user0> Was it some fraudulent transaction posted on your account?
<user1> No not at all, She justed wanted to make sure I had a good birthday.
<user0> So, it was your partner who used you card
<user0> Oh no! Was anyone hurt?
<user1> ya i had bruises on my leg 
<user0> That's pretty scary.  Did the boar survive the ordeal?
<user1> it attacked me and ran into the bushes . it was a very bad experience.
<user0> Are you willing to go on another safari?
<user1> no i am done with such trips.
<user0> I'm not surprised.
<user0> That's very intense. I am sorry you had to experience that.
<user1> Oh if envy could kill - she would have been dead on the spot.  Needless to say I got over it and found another dress but just at that moment on that day...
<user0> That's good. Time heals all wounds and can be a powerful cure to pain and disdain.
<user1> Indeed.  I had to take a reality check.  Afterall the day wasnt about me, it was about the bride and groom lol.
<user1> You are telling me you are a hoarder?
<user0> lol no I just can't part with items that mean a lot to me like my kids baby things like first shirts ect.
<user1> Everyone is nostalgic one way or another.You are fine
<user1> Oh my goodness! Thats terrible. Did anyone see? My face would be bright red.
<user0> Oh my face was very red indeed and yes unfortunately I got a hugh cheer from a group of lads who witnessed it all.  I was so mortified I just ran home.  Later though I chatted about it with my friends and was finally able to laugh about it.
<user1> I'm sure this will be one of those times where you cringe when you think back on it! I'm sure you made those guy's days though
<user0> haha thats how I am trying to look at it.  Trying to see the funny side.  I have learnt my lesson about that dress though.  I think i will just put it back in the wardrobe and leave it there!
<user0> That's crazy! I'm glad there was nothing there.
<user1> Oh no just my vivid imagination lol.  I do love a good horror but usually I watch them with my husband.  I am clearly not as brave on my own!!
<user0> Some horror movies are so great that they make you consider your own environment.
<user1> You are right there.  Nothing better than a good film in general but horrors can really evoke such reactions from them.
<user1> That's great. I bet it was wonderful experience.
<user0> It was she wasn't really good ans i had no problem helping
<user1> That's cool. Taking that experience into the next phase will be pivotal.
<user0> Yes!! They didn't forget me at Christmas 
<user0> I am sorry to hear that.Did you get hurt.
<user1> no it was a minor accident , but car got damaged little
<user0> Do you have full cover?
<user1> yes , but when i went for claim insurance company terms made me feel helpless.
<user1> Where did this happen?! Were there any other people with you?
<user0> In town, I had my kids with me to buy school supplies.
<user1> Did it happen while you were in the store? I hope that your kids did not see anything too disturbing.
<user1> Oh that is pretty cool. What did you think?
<user0> I think that I didn't appreciate not having to worry about adult stuff back then! 
<user1> Yeah, we were blissfully unaware of the real world in those days. It must have been nice to reminisce.
<user0> It was. It was also crazy to see the 1980s hairstyles. So.much.hairspray.
<user0> That has got to feel good!  You must feel very happy and relaxed!
<user1> Yes I am and thankful since I have 3 young kids at home, 
<user0> Cherish this time you have, because you never know when it could change!
<user0> What restaurant is it for? 
<user1> It's a local non-chain Greek restaurant. It's fancy and supposed to be very good. 
<user0> Sounds good. I love mom n pop restaurants. So much better than big popular restaurants.
<user1> Yes. Almost always better!
<user1> That sounds really interesting. Were there any good matches?
<user0> It was alright, but it was hard to find common ground at first.
<user1> Well at least you are putting yourself out there. A lot of people give up on finding love.
<user1> Oh no, I hate cavities. Are you brushing your teeth eVeryday?
<user0> Yes, but I think I'm genetically hosed when it comes to teeth. I really hate it. 
<user1> Dang, that sucks. I hope you can find a solution for that
<user1> Wow, you must be proud! He might cure cancer next!
<user0> I am proud. And he may eventually cure cancer, but I'd settle right now for him cleaning his room!
<user1> Geniuses don't do chores my friend.
<user1> I'm so sorry to hear about your mom. It's good that you're at peace with it, though. 
<user0> Yeah, she's in a better place now.
<user1> But a part of her is still here in you. 
<user1> They left you all alone? I bet you feel lonely...
<user0> Yeah, it was cool for a while, but the house is way to quiet now
<user1> I know that feeling. I like to keep the TV on to drown out the silence
<user1> Whoever ate it all is evil!!!
<user0> I need to interrogate everyone in this house. I'm so angry. You don't mess with Mom's Pop Tarts!
<user1> I know right. I would be so furious!
<user1> I would do it! Try to be calm about it at first and see how he responds.
<user0> No, next time I might snap. They never show any consideration for anybody on the block. They do whatever they want.
<user1> Yeah, something should be done about it!
<user1> I've done that before when I was just annoyed with them. Don't feel bad!
<user0> Well, I do feel a little guilty, just sitting here on my couch watching tv
<user1> Who cares! I always like to think of satisfying myself first before others!
<user1> Oh no! That's a smelly situation to be in. What did you end up doing to fix it?
<user0> It was truly disgusting. We had to have a crew of plumbers come in and dig up our yard.
<user1> What a pain! I bet that cost a fortune. Did they end up repairing all the portions of yard that they had to rip up?
<user1> That must have been a great reunion! Who was happier, him or you?
<user0> Definitely me, I gave him a big bear hug when he walked out those gates.
<user1> He was lucky to have you waiting there for him!
<user1> Ugh, I hate when unexpected expenses arise.
<user0> Fortunately, my parents offered to loan me the money to fix it. 
<user1> Well, that was nice of them. I hope you take them out to dinner after you pay them back.
<user1> Wow, great for her! I am confused as to how you ended up GAINING though!
<user0> I dunno. Water weight? She looks so good now. I'm really envious. 
<user1> Well, keep at it and you will get where you want to be. It really just comes down to how many calories you take in vs. how many calories you burn per day.
<user1> Please tell me you won a lot of money.
<user0> Not a lot - $100. But that's $100 more than I had when I woke up this morning. I was so surprised I did one of those annoying girly squeals at the check out counter
<user1> lol That's how I would of reacted too. One hundred dollars can buy you a lot of stuff.
<user1> OH NO! That's infuriating. Did the stain come out?
<user0> Yes, but I had to spend extra money to get the carpet shampooed. I gave them a spanking that they will never forget. I'm not putting up with this no more.
<user1> Hopefully they remember
<user1> Did you brush it right out?
<user0> I did. But dozen of people had already seen it. I was mortified. No one told me!
<user1> Maybe you could give them a call on the phone and tell them about your feelings?
<user1> You could go to the party. And then learn how to swim!
<user0> I'm not sure, I might just stay in the shallow part of the pool.
<user1> Yea, and you can bring some water toys to play with!
<user1> Awesome! I bet you felt proud at what you accomplished. Did you have this goal in mind for a while?
<user0> Yes. I've wanted to be healthier, but I also wanted to look hot and feel confident at this event. 
<user1> How much total weight did you lose, and how long did it take?
<user1> Thats awesome.  I wish I could go.  Where are you going?
<user0> On a cruise to Havana. I'm so excited!
<user1> Cruises are awesome.  You get to eat as much food as you want.  You'll probably put on like 10 pounds
<user1> Aww man, I hope you brought your raincoat.
<user0> Thankfully I had remembered to put an umbrella in my bag before I left the house. 
<user1> That's good, you don't want to get soaked and catch a cold.
<user1> That's amazing. You must have been so surprised and happy!
<user0> Totally, I was in shock.
<user1> Did you get a video of it?
<user1> Gee, he must have been really hungry! That's a lot of eggs!
<user0> I stayed to watch to see if he'd eat them all. He did. I was very impressed.
<user1> Wow.. that's unbelievable. I wonder how his cholesterol is. 
<user1> Oh dang, that really sucks. I can't believe TSA would go that far, it must've been super embarrassing. 
<user0> Yeah, I will never show my face there again.
<user1> Dude, you should definitely report it someone or the company because you could probably get something out of it.
<user1> Oh yeah, what was it called? I really love roller coasters!
<user0> Millenium Force, in Cedar Point. It was utterly terrifying. 
<user1> I saw that one on TV. It looks absolutely nuts. I hope to visit Cedar Point one day!
<user1> Oh, I hope you get some good news. I am sure it would help you getting aid for college.
<user0> Yes, I think my stats are good. I'm hopeful there will be some good news soon.
<user1> All you can do is be patient and see what happens. I am sure everything will work out for you.
<user1> That's awesome. I hope it works out for your friend and their fiancee. Are you excited to be there?
<user0> Super excited! These two have been together forever. It's about time they made it legit!
<user1> Well I am sure they appreciate you being a part of their big day. Enjoy the after party!
<user1> Wow, that sounds fun. What type of artwork did you see?
<user0> It was watercolors. My neighbor was the artist. I had no idea she did such great work. She also has two toddlers. I have no idea how she manages all of that.
<user1> Gee, she must have her hands full! I hope she does well as an artist!
<user1> Did you feel very emasculated by this?
<user0> No, it actually turned me on. I didn't know she was that strong.
<user1> Yeah, I can see that viewpoint as well. She may end up carrying you to bed next time!
<user1> I'm glad he returned home safe and sound. Did he have fun on the camping trip?
<user0> He did. I'm a worrier, but I need to learn to let go more. 
<user1> My mom was the same way. It's all part of being a parent. I hope to have kids soon too and I worry about stuff concerning them myself!
<user1> Oh wow, I bet the emotions of that came back to you.
<user0> Yes, it was so much fun to see the younger version of me and my husband, pre-kids. Very sentimental.
<user1> Yes, those memories are what make life so special.
<user1> So, not a surprise, but still nice to get? 
<user0> Yeah, kind of ruined the surprise, but I can always count on my wife to make me feel special.
<user1> That's sweet. 
<user1> Wow, thats very admirable of you.  People who abuse animals are the worst kind of people.
<user0> I agree, we should protect and nurture animals, not abuse them. 
<user1> I have 2 dogs myself and I could never imagine hurting them.  I can't believe there are people out there who think that that is ok. its sick.
<user1> Yeah those were the days. When we had no worries in the world.
<user0> yes indeed.  i wish i had my treehouse back that my dad built for me.  i would live in it.
<user1> That sounds really cool. I always wanted a treehouse but never had a good tree for it.
<user0> i grew up in the country, it was a great place to grow up.
<user0> Oh yeah, why is that?
<user1> Because they park in my driveway!
<user0> I would have them towed!
<user1> i have signs up this year, so i can do that legally!
<user0> Oh so you have to have a sign up to legally tow them?
<user1> Yes. Which i think is wrong.  If they are on my property i should have the right without the sign.
<user0> Or you could just park behind them so that they would have to knock on your door before you let them out.
<user0> That's awesome. Which Disney park did you go to?
<user1> disney world. it's the only one Ive ever been to .
<user0> Ooh I live pretty close to it. You have a great husband to give you that treat!
<user1> Oh my, you must be there every day then!
<user1> That's good that you found happiness. That's what were all in the pursuit of right?
<user0> Exactly! I used to struggle but i don't anymore
<user1> You are blessed. Make sure to spread the positive energy. 
<user0> I do every chance i get, and thank you!
<user0> that's great that you can trust her.  how old?
<user1> Yeah, she's a good kid and hasn't given me any reason to think otherwise. She just turned 18.
<user0> That's great. Be thankful, some people aren't so lucky.
<user0> what did you almost buy?
<user1> It was a combination rice-cooker and vegetable steamer.  It looked so good in the ad, but when I got there, it looked cheap and shabby!
<user0> It's hard to find good quality at walmart
<user1> I hope I can find one that lives up to the promise of that ad.  Maybe somwhere else, right?
<user0> I would try target.  good quality stuff there.
<user1> I could try online, but I'd have to buy it first and then see if it's good quality.
<user0> try googling it, and read thru the reviews
<user0> Finding a buyer can be tough.  You have a good agent?
<user1> I hope i do.  We will see, I know it can take a while.\
<user0> Does it have a good location?  You know the only rule of real estate, right?  Location, Location, Location.
<user1> yes i live behind a school.
<user0> Sounds good.  Definitely should target a family buyer then
<user1> yes, but i will leave that to the listing agent.
<user0> You got a figure in mind for your house or are you letting the agent handle that as well?
<user0> Thats never good when you have a bad manager.  What made them so bad?
<user1> He was the "marketing manager" but couldn't market his way out of a paper bag, it was impossible to work with him. Plus he thought he knew everything which made it worse.
<user0> Know it alls are the worst.  Hopefully you are in a better spot now, with a manager who cares.
<user1> I am actually, thank you for caring!
<user1> Oh no! What's wrong with your dad?
<user0> he is old, and he lives alone.  i just worry because he is getting old.  he gets on ok, but i don't know how much longer.
<user1> Aw, I'm so sorry to hear that. It's not easy to watch our parents age. 
<user0> no it's not, but hopefully our kids will do the same for us some day.
<user1> We can surely hope! 
<user1> That must have made you feel terrible. Were you able to find the dog?
<user0> I feel so bad. I forgot to lock the gate. No, but I put up a lot of posters, so hopefully I find him before my neighbor comes back.
<user1> I sincerely hope you can find him! But I bet your neighbor will understand it was just a mistake and you didn't do it on purpose.
<user1> Doesn't he understand that people have to go to work in the morning?
<user0> His parents paid his bills so no, he didn't understand that sadly. I tried talking to him about it but clearly he didn't get the picture as he kept doing it.
<user1> You might have to file a noise complaint with the police.
<user1> What is causing you to question whether it's the right thing for you or not?
<user0> well, it is retail.  ive done retail and it is not fun.
<user1> Yeah, I've done that as well.  It can definitely be a hard job, considering dealing with the public, hours during holiday seasons, etc.. But sometimes if the pay is good, it can outweigh some of the negatives.
<user0> that's true. i don't like dealing with people.
<user0> lol that remind me of a movie i saw with robert deniro , thats absolutly bizzare by the way but cool at the same time
<user1> I know which movie you're talking about! I think they actually had to train that cat to do it. Mine just... learned.
<user0> wow , i would love to have a cat like yours 
<user0> Aww thats too bad that no one else could go.  What concert was it?
<user1> It was a Marilyn Manson concert. I was even dancing by myself.
<user0> haha that must have been a crazy concert! 
<user0> Sometimes that depends on the industry. If she works in ones that have high turnover it's not a big of a deal as, say, an administrative job
<user1> She's in banking so there are definitely a lot of available jobs. And there seems to be a lot of turnover so you're probably right.
<user0> Well, I'm not entirely sure about the banking side but I wonder what she's looking for. Perhaps a small vs big bank culture
<user0> OOO I love doing that, but not so much the upheaval in the midst of it.  What room are you going to be working on?
<user1> I finished my kitchen, so the next room is going to be my family room.  Just painting it really. 
<user0> Still, a new color can definitely brighten up a space and make it feel all new!
<user1> Oh yes, we haven't decided on the color yet.
<user1> That's awesome!  I wish I could wake up that way every morning.  Did something specific make you feel that way?
<user0> I don't know, I think it was because I had a dream about marrying Scarlett Johansson.
<user1> Ha!!  Well I've woken up from a dream and been mad at my husband because of something he did in my dream - I guess it can go the other way too!
<user1> I've done that before... I enjoyed it too! I love looking back at old pictures and stuff
<user0> Did your parents save a lot of your school work like mine did? I'm surprised how much my mom kept!
<user1> Some of it but my grandma did save a lot.  I plan on doing that with my kids
<user1> I love cheese too! What kind of cheese was it?
<user0> Smoked gouda, one of my favorites! I ate it all in a day haha
<user1> Gouda is great! Do you like prosciutto too?
<user0> YES. Basically anything meat and cheese and I am totally there!
<user0> Aww poor baby, hopefully shes doing fine now.
<user1> She's doing great, thanks! It was a tough recovery for a few days but then you could tell she felt SO much better.
<user0> That's great to hear. You have one tough cat.
<user0> Ha, I used to do that too. But I was almost always disappointed by the toy once I actually got it.
<user1> Right? but when you collected them all there was no greater feeling.
<user0> True! McDonald's was my first job when I was 14 and I remember being stoked I could now collect ALL the toys even if I didn't play with them!
<user0> Did they tell you when you may hear back from them?
<user1> They said within the week, I know it's only been a few days but I'm excited about the opportunity!
<user0> I pray they get in touch with you soon and that's is an affirmative on the job!  I know  how nerve-wracking waiting can be though - I hope you get it!
<user0> Arghhhhhhhhh! I soooo feel for you and have been there. Have y'all had the chance to talk about it? (Or do you even want to?)
<user1> I've kind of avoided her a bit. I'm trying to come up with an apology that feels heartfelt. It's a horrible feeling!
<user0> I hear you. Maybe humor might help? Like "okay, so *this* is awkward....can we talk about that email?" Heartfelt apologies go a long way, and even if she doesn't respond -- you'll feel better for trying.
<user0> Are you sure they didnt bring the wrong bill?
<user1> It had everything we ordered plus a couple things at the bottom we didn't order.
<user0> I would have complained.
<user1> Oh, I did, she immediately said ok I'll take it off like it happened all the time. Made me think it was done on purpose just to see if I  wouldn't notice.
<user1> Ohh, I feel sorry for you
<user0> Oh don't feel bad, I live a lovely life and have many friends. It's just that they usually go home to their own families that time of year.
<user1> Ohh, that's bad. You can always skype your family!
<user1> Yes, I feel you. Cleaning sucks, but after all that hard work, the results are amazing!
<user0> Right? It's so rewarding when you're finished and everything smells good. I love that feeling.
<user1> Me too! You seem just like me!
<user1> That sounds very exciting! What kind of planning did you put into such an achievement?
<user0> It is! Lots of blood, sweat and tears - and lots of phone calls and signing things, haha. We can't wait to move in!
<user1> That's so cool! I wish you the very best and hope that the blood sweat and tears turns into happiness, joy and fun times!
<user1> Are there any other family members out there that could help her?
<user0> No. She asked her friend to call me after it happened but wasn't able to tell me many details.
<user1> Wow, I hope that she was able to work things out. Not the best way to start living somewhere far from home, but I'm sure she figured something out.
<user0> They took her to the hospital for evaluation but she ended up just being a bit bruised up. I was worried something like this would happen. Everything did work out in the end though.
<user0> That's great! I am happy for you!
<user1> Thanks, I'm happy about it. I only have to work a few hours a week, it's pretty amazing.
<user0> Yeah, and they are paying you good enough. You are a luckiest person!
<user0> i honestly have never gone to jury duty , but im sure it was still a pain to put it on your schedule 
<user1> yes i am not looking forward to it.  ive heard that its just awful.
<user0> same thing i heard too , really long and boring being there against your will 
<user1> yes i think it is going to be a long week or so.
<user1> I am so sorry to hear that. I have been devastated by the loss of pets in the past, so I can understand what you're going through. I'm sure she was very loved and had a great life with you and your family.
<user0> She really was a wonderful pet. We just got a puppy recently, which is the same breed as the one who passed away. She's bringing some light back into our lives. 
<user1> Aww that's great! What breed? 
<user1> Oh no! that sounds so scary. was everything ok?
<user0> Yes, thankfully everything turned out fine. I had to spend 3 weeks in the hospital though!
<user1> Good I'm glad to hear that.  That's a long time.  Hospitals scare me, I can't imagine being there for that long
<user1> I'm so sorry to hear that! Hopefully he or she wasn't in too much pain at the end.
<user0> no i don't think so, but it was violent.  she was run over by a car.  
<user1> Oh my gosh that's horrible. I hope they caught the person who hit her!
<user0> i don't think i will ever know. they usually don't stop when that happens.
<user0> oh man, that's gross! at least it was vomit and not something else.
<user1> Yeah it was pretty gross but one of my cats is pretty pukey, I should have known better and watched where I was walking.
<user0> how many cats do have?
<user1> Well right now I have six but they're not all mine, I foster for a cat rescue. Three are mine, three are for adoption. It gets crazy in my house!
<user1> Aw, I am so sorry. How long did you have your dog for?
<user0> About 5 years. He was a rescue.
<user1> They say dogs are mans best friend. 
<user0> That's true. He was definitely mine.
<user1> What kind of dog was he?
<user0> He was a pit and lab mix.
<user1> Nice, I have an australian shepherd. He follows me around everywhere. 
<user1> Oh no. That's terrible. I lost my dad five years ago, I know how terrible that feels.
<user0> I'm sorry to hear that. I'm going on just over two years. Never thought it would happen to us.
<user1> Neither did we. He seemed so healthy, and then within weeks he was so sick he couldn't even talk. I miss him every day,
<user0> They will live on in our love and memories. I hope the heaviness lessens one day at a time <3
<user0> surprise gifts are always fun.
<user1> Very! I decided since it was surprise money I would waste it on something fun.
<user0> that sounds like a well deserved plan.
<user0> Oh man, I can relate, that feeling of anxiety before you get there really turns around when you get caught up in the moment
<user1> Exactly.  I just saw how much fun it looked and I thought to myself I should just live a little.  It's not often you get to have experiences like that.
<user0> Life is full of experiences like that, they seem scary from the outside, but once you relax you get swept away
<user0> that sounds prettty bad!
<user1> yes, i have retraced my steps and i can't find it.  hopefully i will find it when i need it the most.
<user0> I cannot imagine if something like that happens to me. I would be trying very hard to find it.
<user1> i have looked everywhere. it's so frustrating.
<user0> Sometimes by remembering all the places that you have been in the past two days can help. I will try that!
<user0> I agree completely it is an embarrassment to the parents you would think. 
<user1> The worst is when they're screaming at them rather than just speaking to them calmly. 
<user0> The frustration they go through well at least we don't have to take the kids or parents home.
<user0> What store were you at? 
<user1> I was going to Walgreen's and they was out and the sale began today. 
<user0> Could you get a rain check? That is a bummer? 
<user1> It get's worse no rain check but they insist on giving me customer service number to still receive points towards my card.
<user1> Aw man, I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anything I can do to make you feel better? 
<user0> thanks! my coworker went out on lunch break and bought my favorite ice cream cake!
<user1> Ice cream cake is my favorite! I'm glad you're feeling better haha. You have a really nice co-worker.
<user0> yes she is honestly the greatest 
<user1> That's really awesome! She sounds like a great person to work with.
<user1> Oh, I know how that goes. My husband loves sweets, but if it is just sitting there and no one is eating it It will get eaten right then. Getting another would depend on how much he likes sweets and needs them. lol
<user0> Right! It's almost like, you knew this was going to happen. I feel terrible but it was so good lol. I'll get him some more tomorrow!
<user1> That's probably what I would do also. It won't kill him to wait another day.
<user1> Oh I hate when that happens. we go to self checkout to avoid things like slow lines.
<user0> Exactly! I wasn't in a hurry or anything but it felt so inconsiderate.
<user1> Hopefully the person learned what they had to do so they don't hold the line up in the future.
<user0> We can only hope.
<user0> Oh man, that must have hurt. Did she know you had feelings for her?
<user1> Yes. But at the time she was unavailable. Then when she wasn't spoken for my "friend" asked her out.
<user0> Sounds like your friend broke bro code, that was kind of scummy.
<user0> Wow! What a nice friend. I wish my friends did that
<user1> Yea I was really thankful and appreciative for it.  He's like a brother to me.
<user0> That's great. It's nice to have people so close to you. It really helps in bad times
<user1> It really does.  I think when it comes to friends quality is better than quantity.  I like to have friends that feel like family.
<user1> That must of been a proud moment for you as a father.  She's all grown up and out in the real world now
<user0> Yes this is a new milestone and now she get's to see what real school is all about with all age groups.
<user1> That's awesome, she'll have a great time and learn a lot i'm sure!
<user1> Wow! What are you gonna do with the winnings?
<user0> Oh they are long gone,lol. Bills to pay and all.
<user1> Bills do take up a lot, don't they.
<user0> They sure do. The raffle did allow me to get ahead of things for a while though.
<user0> Oh my gosh! thats funny.  was that the only thing that made you think it was haunted?
<user1> Haha yeah it was pretty funny once I realized what the spooky sound coming from the kitchen was.
<user0> How did you discover exactly what it was?
<user1> I turned off the TV and my phone and tried to trace the sound to its source. I feel ridiculous about it now in hindsight!
<user1> Roller coasters are scary for me. How was it for you?
<user0> Fun but scary I couldn't wait for it to end lol had my eyes closed most of the ride. 
<user1> I'm the same way haha. But how was it fun if you have your eyes closed the whole time?!
<user0> My hands was up and feeling the wind in my face and facing my fears but I kept them closed because I just couldn't look because of the height lol. 
<user0> I am so sorry to hear that. I'm sure she was very happy while she was alive with you guys.
<user1> She had a good life. She was actually my mom's cat, she came to live with me when my mom died.
<user0> You went through a lot of losses.
<user0> That sounds painful, I hope you were okay after your fall. 
<user1> I was ok just the look on m face let you know I was ashamed lol I turned red instantly. 
<user0> Yeah i bet that was really embarrassing, but I'm glad you're okay. 
<user0> Oh boy!  That's always a nail biter waiting to hear back and it seems like they love to take the full amount of time before they let you know. Did you get it?!!
<user1> I did get it! If I was a praying kind of guy I would have done so every day. I was o nervous.
<user0> Amazing! Congratulation! Prayer is always a good thing to do! That is so incredible.  Are you enjoying the job?
<user0> I remember those times. Did you get what you wanted?
<user1> Well I was really looking forward to the Super Nintendo.  It had just come out that year and everyone my age wanted one.
<user0> The super nintendo is a classic. What is your favorite game?
<user1> Yea, they tried to trick me and wrap a box of clothes the same size to make me think I didn't get it.  My favorite game has to be Earthbound.
<user1> Oh no! I'm so sorry!  I would feel the same way but you just have to think...who cares what others think!  If they can't have compassion for an accident then something is wrong with them.  Did you get hurt?
<user0> You're right, the other people probably hardly noticed. And no, thankfully I was OK! Unless you count the bruise on my ego.
<user1> I bet they didn't.  I like to look at experiences as part of our journey and teaches us to have compassion for others in similar situations.  So glad you're alright! Hope you own a helmet!
<user0> That's solid advice, thank you. And yes, I own a helmet, but admittedly don't wear it as often as I should. I will now!
<user0> How'd the hurricane go?
<user1> Wouldn't you know it totally missed my city. I was a little let down to be honest, though glad we were safe.
<user0> Thank goodness. Hurricanes are no joke.
<user0> Was he okay?
<user1> He was fine. I just didn't know how he was going to handle it, he is a very nervous dog.
<user0> Well maybe if you do it a little more then he will be fine with it. I would be afraid just because he is afraid.
<user1> That's true. He was a rescue and sometimes I wonder if he was treated in a bad way and thats why he is like that.
<user0> Maybe so. It's good he has a good home now.
<user1> I like to think he does. I just hope he is as happy as he makes me.
<user0> I bet he is. Don't worry
<user0> That is a great idea
<user1> Yes it works out great saves me money and keeps my scheduled arranged and on track. 
<user0> Saving money is important
<user0> That's amazing! You must be so proud.
<user1> Oh I am. It's nice to know that I raised a child with a good head on her shoulders.
<user0> She's also a hard worker.
<user1> I like to think so, although it seemed to alwasy be easy for her. 
<user1> That was very sweet they don't have to actually do that.
<user0> It was sweet. And I told him not to worry about it, I didn't want to hold him up. 
<user1> Good to know there is still kind people in the world.
<user1> That's awesome! Who were they from?
<user0> My husband but I didn't expect it I was so surprised they was a just because gift.
<user1> That was really sweet of him, maybe he just wanted you to know you're loved.
<user1> You can never be too prepared! I am sure you have got everything.
<user0> I hope so. I even portioned out each meal for our dogs in little plastic bags to make sure we have enough. 
<user1> That was very smart thinking on your part. Have fun on your trip!
<user1> We all do things we regret when drinking
<user0> True. The funny thing was I obsessed over it for days, worrying I made a mistake. And absolutely nothing happened! I worried for nothing.
<user1> Thats usually how it goes
<user1> You definitely took a leap of faith there. How'd it go?
<user0> It definitely has had its ups and downs but overall I'm really glad I did it. I don't think I'll be doing it again any time soon that's for sure.
<user1> hahaha I definitely admire your courage to have done that.
<user1> I wish you luck
<user0> Thanks I am super excited I know I will have a great outcome I have goals to meet.
<user1> I am sure you will meet them
<user1> That's disappointing. What happened? Did he just not do anything?
<user0> Yeah, he acted like it was just a normal day, it was so weird. Maybe I'm getting too old to make a big deal out of birthdays anyway.
<user1> I would have been disappointed, too. 
<user1> Oh no that is a total bummer. It's especially common in the summer months.
<user0> Yes it's the worse especially in Florida it's sunny one day and pouring down raining the next. 
<user1> Oh right, I spent some time in Florida when I was younger and I remember it being so unpredictable. Just gotta keep an umbrella all the time lol.
<user1> Cool. Was it interesting?
<user0> Yes. It was a good friend of mine. She got a novel published! She also has four small kids. I'm not sure how she does it all.
<user1> Good for her! Moms get a lot done lol
<user1> ARe you happy or sad?
<user0> Sad. I will miss her terribly 
<user1> I bet. I she moving school or a job?
<user1> Oh cool that's great! What were you doing that they recognised?
<user0> For over exceeding and helping all staff when in need, I am always just helpful but was happy to get noticed for my hard work.
<user1> Awesome. What is your job?
<user0> I work for the state we help clients with disabilities find employment it is case management work.
<user0> Wow was it a scam or was it legit?
<user1> I was really sure it was a scam but it turned out it was a prize for a survey I had submitted a few weeks ago!
<user0> That is so good congratulations you are lucky what are you going to use it for?
<user1> Thanks! No idea actually, it's for a department store here in Australia so will have to look around
<user1> Oh no, what happened?
<user0> I finished a fabulous workout, then promptly fell UP the stairs on my way to the locker room. In front of everyone. I was mortified.
<user1> Oh no! But that happens (it has happened to me several times). At least you had the great workout!
<user1> That's great. Are you excited?
<user0> Yes, and incredibly happy. I was getting really worried about the bills. 
<user1> Is it your dream job? Then you should really be happy.
<user1> Was it real?
<user0> Haha that was my first thought too. It actually was!
<user1> That's awesome. What are you going to buy?
<user0> Thanks! No idea actually, it's for a department store here in Australia
<user1> Australia. I hope to go there some day
<user0> You definitely should! It's a really cool place, but so hard to see everything because it's so big
<user1> I bet, I will get there one day
<user1> I've done the same thing before. I'm sure you weren't a bother
<user0> I hope not. Now that you mention it I'm sure it happens all the time.
<user1> Yeah and they really should be better about how they place their racks
<user1> That has happend to me too.
<user0> I got my hopes up too much. I should wait for reviews to come out before I rush out and buy next time.
<user1> You can always sell them if you buy discs. Cant do anything with a download though
<user0> That's very true.  Which is why I prefer physical discs most of the time.
<user1> We live and we learn lol
<user0> Exactly.  Next time I'm waiting for prices to drop, months after launch.
<user0> I used to love that band
<user1> Yeah they were great back in the day. I can't comment on their new stuff, I haven't listened to any of it in years.
<user0> I have not either
<user0> Probably at 4 or 5! lol
<user1> You got it. 5:00. WHY does this still happen? I wasted the whole day waiting. 
<user0> No idea! I haven't had cable in so long! I would HATE that and they always over charge! Don't they have a rule that theres no service fee if they are late?
<user0> Was it real because I get those every day lol
<user1> Haha yeah it actually turned out to be real! It was for $120
<user0> I could do so much with $120. Im jealous lol
<user0> oh no! what happened?
<user1> My older son called from the bathroom that we were out of toilet paper. It seemed...um...urgent....Fortunately, we had an emergency stash in the laundry room.
<user0> ah, crisis averted! that could have been a lot worse
<user0> Was it good? I hate when your favorite place disappoints.
<user1> It was good! It always is. I had my "usual" pasta and just enough wine to feel relaxed, but not loopy. It was a good way to end a Sunday.
<user0> That's great. Sundays are supposed to be breezy
<user0> Hm, that sounds interesting. I'm not really familiar with this kind of situation, since I've never had to rent a car. What exactly happened, or what did that mean?
<user1> Yeah I was travelling in the US and they just had a drop box where you put the keys and a form in. Luckily I asked a stranger who was passing by and they gave me a really nice pen to keep
<user0> Oh, so it was no big deal? At least you cared enough to stop someone and ask them about it. No harm, no foul.
<user0> I bet that was a nice feeling
<user1> It definitely was. The money is great and I get to set my own hours!
<user0> That sounds perfect
<user0> The dentist makes me a bit nervous
<user1> It makes me VERY nervous. I hate it. I'll probably barely sleep tonight because of it. 
<user0> Well at least think about the fact that it's a good thing to go to the dentist!
<user0> That is awful, did the person who hit it leave a note or a call back number? 
<user1> No. They just hit it and left the airport parking lot. I'm pretty incensed. 
<user0> You should ask the airport people if they have any security footage of the parking lot, maybe they can track down the car.
<user0> What kind of food was there?
<user1> Really intricate things - souffles and such. I was very impressed.
<user0> It is nice that you enjoyed it.
<user0> Oh man.  That would of startled me too.  What did you do after?
<user1> Stood on the couch and screamed some more! I do not do rodents. I'm having my son handle it. I think he's putting out traps tonight.
<user0> Well I can understand your nervousness.  I probably would be on guard as well
<user0> Oh that is tough.  It is hard when our pets pass away.
<user1> It really is. She was the first pet that was really "mine". She brought a lot of happiness to my life!
<user0> It is like losing a family member isn't it.  Well, just think of all the good times and be thankful.
<user0> That's great! I never really studied much so I could have done better on my tests
<user1> Same here. I never had to study for high school but when I hit college, it was a wakeup call.
<user0> Oh yes. But, I found that getting involved in clubs along with a major I liked actually allowed me to spend less time studying and more time learning for fun. It's a subtle, but important diffeence
<user0> Judging by the :(, I'm assuming you didn't get to join them?
<user1> Yeah, we were supposed to go but I couldn't get off work. I got to see all the pictures on Facebook though, ha! So envious.
<user0> I would be envious too.  Perhaps next time you can go somewhere and return the feeling :D
<user1> Sounds like a plan :)
<user0> I hope where ever you go, you visit someplace amazing!
<user0> That is nice. Do you like a lot pizza?
<user1> Yeah I definitely like a lot of pizza.  This place had a all you can eat buffet.  I ate my fill of pizza!
<user0> You are lucky.
<user1> I made sure it was the only thing I ate all day.  I was pretty content.
<user1> Were you worried about something? What was keeping you up?
<user0> There was something scratching on my window.  I was pretty nervous.
<user1> Hopefully you had a lock on them, you can never be too safe.
<user0> Well that's the thing.  when I looked out in the morning I didn't see anything.
<user0> Dang really! Sounds like you have a boyfriend that likes to shower you with presents.
<user1> He's generous yeah but I wouldn't call it "showering." He's just good about knowing what I need!
<user0> That means that he is always listening and paying attention to you!
<user0> I have never tried a cold shower? What is it like?
<user1> It's very cold and refreshing, wakes you up instantly.
<user0> I bet it does wake you up right away. I guess I should try that sometime if I oversleep. lol !
<user0> wow that is very rude of her
<user1> It really is. I'm not sure what to do though besides reporting her to the HOA. Any suggestion?
<user0> No I have never dealt with a rude person like that that lives near me
<user1> Lucky you! For some reason I seem to be attracted to apartments filled with rude people.
<user1> I totally agree. That actually sounds really good rihgt now.
<user0> So lets go, I'll meet you outside in an hour. 
<user1> Sounds fun. Ill be ready. Hope were going to the beach thats closest to us!
<user1>  I will be expecting to see you there.
<user0> Yes, tomorrow as well as today are such a nice places. 
<user1> Having positive attitude always succeed. Keep it up.
<user1> Interesting.  What was the first thought that popped into your head when you witnessed this?
<user0> It was...Dandelion. 
<user1> Is that a reference to the color of the hair, the shape or something else?
<user1> How did it go? That's an anxiety-inducing but hopeful situation!
<user0> No I was very assured in my interview.  I got the job, probably because of my attitude.
<user1> Congratulations! Enjoy the new gig! Good things happen to good people.
<user0> I could definitely feel it going to other way if I was defeatist in my interview.
<user1> Being defeatist is never a good move. Honestly, once you've got your foot in the door I think it's all about personality. 
<user0> It can be, but personality can't make up for incomptence either.
<user1> I would argue most good employers can diagnose incompetence from the first or second conversation. If they can't, maybe they aren't good employers.
<user1> Time does fly really fast. I just turned 30 and it feels like I was just a teenager yesterday!
<user0> Enjoy it, your 30s go by really fast. I'm clinging desperately to the last few years of mine myself.
<user1> I'm sure it will. At least it gets us to enjoy life more and focus on the moment.
<user1> Yeah, it's like a small world.
<user0> Exactly, how does it even work?
<user1> I think it is merely a coincidence.
<user1> Indeed they can. Is there any specific moment that you would like to talk about?
<user0> Yes, things like great classical music for example. 
<user1> Oh, I see. I thought that some other bad things happening in your personal life are making you cry
<user1> I completely agree. We must have positive thoughts at all times. 
<user0> Yes, that's a good start.
<user1> Our thoughts are were everything starts. Mindset is so important. 
<user1> That's awesome!  What do they do?
<user0> They work in the oil field. My husband left the company they both worked for and I can't help but think if he still worked their he would have gotten a raise too.
<user1> That would be nice, but it's never good to dwell on things like that instead of looking toward the future.
<user1> That sucks. How fast were you driving?
<user0> Only a couple miles over. It's always a terrible thing to see those lights in your mirror.
<user1> I hate getting pulled over too. Especailly for something silly like being a couple of miles an hour over the speed limit
<user1> Oh man, I'm so sorry to hear that. You're not a loser though! Just take one day at a time. If you relapsed yesterday just move on and do your best not to drink today and tomorrow
<user0> I just can't believe I gave in to the pressure. Oh well, yeah your right. I'll start by taking baby steps.
<user1> Don't be so hard on yourself. We are all humans, we make mistakes. 
<user1> That is probably so annoying
<user0> I have a 3 year old, so he wakes up at 5:30 because of all the hammering going on.
<user1> That really sucks. How long will it be going on?
<user1> Wow.  That's either really lucky or unlucky, depending on what you want.  Are you wanting kids?
<user0> Yeah, it just came at an unexpected time. I really want a little boy.
<user1> Well, then congratulations!  I wish you the best of luck, and enjoy this time! :)
<user1> Why not?
<user0> There was this couple sitting two rows in front of me.... they just wouldn't shut up.
<user1> Oh man! That is why I watch movies at home. It's just more comfortable.
<user1> I have considered it myself but feel the same as you. Will you go back again? 
<user0> I might. It just makes me a little uneasy having to share personal information with a total stranger.
<user1> right, i feel you but maybe it will be good to get it all out!! 
<user1> Is she doing okay now?
<user0> Yes, she had a really difficult 6 months and then things started improving. 
<user1> great, I am very glad to hear she is getting better!
<user1> What is the job?
<user0> I got the job has an software Analysis and that was aim
<user1> Well congrats then, I am sure that is not easy
<user0> A little bit. But when we doing it in a rightway from our heart really it will be easy 
<user0> What caused that to happen?
<user1> A server went down and I didn't get paid for my work :(
<user0> Oh gosh, hopefully it doesnt happen next time
<user1> Yeah I hope not, I can't afford work stoppages!
<user1> What were the photos of?
<user0> just old family photos
<user1> It is good to have those and look at once in awhile
<user1> I am sorry to hear that, what happened?
<user0> We just grew apart I guess. House seems so empty with her and the kids gone.
<user1> Did you try therapy at all or counseling?
<user1> Why is that?
<user0> We're poor, and bills are adding up
<user1> I am sorry to hear that, I hope things improve for you a ton!
<user0> Thank you! I do as well
<user0> Sometimes we believe is the things that happen to us ... they are many
<user1> What sort of things?
<user0> I interpret the difficulties
<user1> What sort of difficulties/
<user0> the lack of humor
<user1> Ah, it's no joke is it
<user0> Ok
<user0> Oh goodness, I am so sorry to hear that. Was it sudden?
<user1> Yeah, he developed a stage 4 glioma in his brain that could not be removed.
<user0> That is awful and very sorry you had to go through that. I work at a cancer hospital so I can't imagine going through that with a loved one.
<user0> What kind of stuff is in there?
<user1> just old sports uniforms and toys and stuff like that
<user0> Oh okay, I love going through my old stuff too, it is really fun
<user0> That sounds so fun!
<user1> I cant wait! we have been looking forward to going back since our honeymoon.
<user0> I hope you both have tons of fun!
<user1> Thank you. We plan on it!
<user1> that's great! I'm glad to hear that. we often take our health for granted.
<user0> We do, and don't do enough to take care of it
<user1> i'm one of those people. Eat junk food even though i know it's not good for me
<user0> Ah, it'll catch up to you :(
<user0> Uh OH what happened
<user1> I was giving a presentation on the project that I'm working on, and I overlooked something simple.... one of my coworkers called me out on it. How embarrassing.
<user0> Oh no, well mistakes do happen, it will be behind you in a few days
<user1> I certainly hope so. The sooner everyone forgets about this, the better.
<user0> Exactly good luck
<user1> Thank you, I'm just glad it was at the end of the presentation so I was able to get out of there shortly after.
<user1> Oh yeah? What kind of old stuff?
<user0> Old metal lunch boxes like Charlies Angels speed buggy ect
<user1> I always liked those old lunch boxes myself. Do you have a favorite?
<user0> Hong Kong Phooey lol
<user1> Nice! I loved that show when I was a kid. I never had the lunch box though.
<user1> Oh, OK!  WHere are you moving to?
<user0> Another house, it's closer to school
<user1> That's good!  That will make your life much easier!  Congratulations!
<user1> That's exciting. Do you have a plan for a date for when she says yes?
<user0> Yeah, I already have it all planned out. We get along really well, so I'm sure she's going to say yes.
<user1> What all is on the agenda for the date?
<user0> I'm going to take her to this restaurant she really likes, then go to a movie. I'm gonna show her a great time.
<user0> Great. Are you going to get it published?
<user1> Definitely! I'm pretty happy with this one, can't wait to get it published.
<user0> What is the book about?
<user1> To say anything about it at all would be giving too much away!
<user0> Boo. What genre?
<user0> OH NO that is the worst! Did you clean it up?
<user1> Well I threw it out. It was some unidentifiable stuff in a plastic container. It had been in there for months, I think.
<user0> You shoudl write the date on stuff to prevent that from happening again
<user1> You know, that's not a bad idea. Ugh, it was so disgusting.
<user1> Oh no! What happened?
<user0> She fell off a kitchen stool
<user1> Ouch. I hope she's okay.
<user1> thats good, its always a good feeling after
<user0> Yeah, I'm pretty happy. Now I can just sit back and relax.
<user1> thats the way to do it
<user0> I agree. Now I don't have anything to worry about for the rest of the day.
<user0> Did his team win?
<user1> yes
<user0> That's great news! I bet you're so proud.
<user0> Oh no!  Why are they driving you crazy?
<user1> They're totally itchy
<user0> That is no good!  I guess it is time for you to go shopping!
<user0> Storms are the worst and destroy so much.
<user1> they are horrible, luckily this one wasnt deadly or too destructive
<user0> My family went through a big storm a few years ago.
<user0> what happened on the phone call?
<user1> I found out that my brother died.
<user0> I am so sorry about that.
<user1> Thank you, I'm pretty devastated to be honest.
<user1> Has it made any scratch marks?
<user0> Nah, he just keeps running up, grabbing and biting, then running away. It was cute and funny at first, now it's just irritating.
<user1> Have you tried disciplining him in anyway
<user0> Yeah, I've sprayed him with a water bottle a few times, it doesn't seem to work very well.
<user1> Sounds like it's time for a crate.
<user1> Yea, I hate calling ATT or Verizon they take forever to get on the phone.
<user0> it is so annoying!
<user1> I think as we get smarter, it will get better.
<user1> Wow!  Sounds like a keeper right there!  That must have been a nice surprise for you!
<user0> It really was! He had to scrimp and save, but it was worth it for both of us in the end :)
<user1> It is always nice when someone gets their priorities right!
<user1> Oh no!  That is horrible!  Is he OK?
<user0> No, unfortunately he didn't make it.
<user1> That is really sad!  I hope it was quick and painless.  I hate seeing anything suffer!
<user0> Yeah, I think it was, but... I'm pretty upset about it.
<user0> Did you let him borrow it?
<user1> Yeah. I know most people would be worried about doing something like that, but... I trust him not to do anything stupid.
<user0> That's good to hear. I assume everything went ok?
<user1> Yeah, he brought it back in one piece. Which I'm obviously happy about.
<user0> Awesome. Alls well that ends well.
<user0> Did you say yes?
<user1> I haven't given an answer yet. I'm just not sure if it's a wise idea or not.
<user0> Where does she plan to go?
<user1> She says she's just going to meet some friends at the movies, but you know how teenagers are.
<user1> Money problems are never fun. Trust me, I know.
<user0> I'm sorry to hear that :( It'd be nice if work paid better
<user1> Yeah, definitely. Have you tried asking for a raise?
<user1> Oh no, I'm so so sorry. I've always had at least one pet throughout my life, and they're truly part of the family.
<user0> They are very much family. I cannot believe we get so attached.
<user1> Yes, they're honestly more dear to me than my friends. I hope you're doing okay - I'm sure your dog was very loved and had a wonderful life, so try to take comfort in that.
<user1> That is great! Doing what?
<user0> Thank you! I'm now a district manager for a local chain of businesses. It's not my favorite thing to do, but the raise is great!
<user1> I bet that is nice and probably has good benefits!
<user1> I can never go on long trips.
<user0> Why not? They used to bother me, but I'm finding that as I get older, they're not so bad.
<user1> I can no longer afford them, long trips cost the most.
<user0> That's unfortunate. I've come to enjoy taking a train as a frugal alternative to flying or driving. No wear and tear on your car, and you don't have to drive.
<user0> Oh no!. Are you ok? Must not have been a bad one if you were laughing?
<user1> Not bad but it was funny because I slipped on a banana peel!
<user0> How ironic. I kind of wish I were there to see it.
<user0> I am bad at every game.
<user1> It's a little different. It's based in picking up and throwing objects like logs, hammers that weight 70 pounds and stones that weight 70 pounds. Being Scottish it keeps me feeling at home.
<user0> I still could not do that, I am very weak human person.
<user1> You can do anything you set your mind to.
<user1> Do what i did, quit the job and live at home with mom.
<user0> I wish. My mom kicked me out at 14 and I've only seen her a handful of times since over the last 20 years.
<user1> I still thing living with a relative is the cheapest way to go.
<user0> I actually really want to buy a van and live in it but my wife said no.
<user0> That's awful! Luckily I paid all mine off, but I know many people still struggle with it
<user1> It started off at 150k so I've paid a lot but it's still crazy. Make me think I would have been better off to just go work construction or something instead of college. 
<user0> Yea...the education costs are atrocious and, honestly, not even worth it on my opinion. It's just the piece of paper. The material you learn from them can be learned online for free or nearly so
<user1> I agree. I feel like I've learned just as much or more from MOCC's since then.
<user1> Typical of most companies.  Ask employees to do more and pay less.
<user0> Yep, it's so frustrating. I'm ready to shake up the system but I feel limited in what I can do, besides quit.
<user1> What kind of job do you have?
<user1> I'm sorry, did anyone see?
<user0> I'm hoping not, but it's possible
<user1> I hope you would wear a belt next time.
<user0> LOL Yes, I learned my lesson
<user0> That sounds like a blast.  Compared to my job LOL.  
<user1> Yes, I know. Ever day I drive an hour to the same place that is slowly killing me inside and she is jetting off to explore.
<user0> I'm sorry.  I like my job but its certainly not like hers!
<user0> LOL.  Be careful.. thats a ton of carbs.
<user1> It's better then the alternative. One good meal then water and ketchup soup the rest of the week.
<user0> eww LOL
<user1> Yea, Rice and beans is so much better then that. 
<user1> Happy Birthday!
<user0> Thank you! I hope your birthday, whenever it is, is awesome as well!
<user1> What all did they do for you?
<user0> Got a big bouquet of flowers, they took me out to eat (lunch and dinner), and we went to the drive-in to top it off :)
<user0> How long did it take for you to teach you dog that?
<user1> A few days. He was so happy!
<user0> I thought I would take longer, like months!
<user0> Oh no. Maybe you can get some things done around the house.
<user1> Yea like working on my resume and netflix.
<user0> Lol, That sounds like a plan. Working two jobs is hard.
<user0> Yummy... what did you eat?  I am hungry.
<user1> I had chicken, asparagus, and a portobello mushroom
<user0> That sounds so good.  Like I love that stuff.
<user0> I am glad no one in your family is sick.
<user1> Thank you! I hope no one in yours is either
<user0> Thank goodness my family is healthy too.
<user0> But do they give raises more frequently and do they have better benefits. It may be worth it still,
<user1> Not for the first few years. The title would be a move up in status but the pay is about a 20% downgrade. I can't take that loss.
<user0> Benefits are worth a lot more than you think sometimes
<user0> is there a special reason?
<user1> No, we just won't be home so we have to eat out
<user0> going anywhere good?
<user1> Pickle Barrel
<user0> that sounds fun
<user0> That is great. How have you done it?
<user1> I've always walked a lot at work. I average 10 miles a day so kept doing that but I cut out all processed food and drinks. 
<user0> That is a lot of walking. I can hardly walk 1 mile.
<user1> I average about 95,000 steps a week.
<user1> I have never been on a trip before.
<user0> I wish I could have went on this one but I couldn't. It ended up bein a long week by myself.
<user1> I have long weeks every single day.
<user1> I would just quit and live off the government.
<user0> Haha, I would if I could! Sounds a like much more laidback way to live.
<user1> Everyone can! Just gotta try.
<user1> how sweet and thoughtful of you
<user0> I already love her. This is the second stray I've found eating out the same dumpster. They are now sisters.
<user1> You seem to be a very compassionate person, very kindhearted.
<user1> Ohh, I so sorry.
<user0> Thank you, it was a very scary situation to be in.
<user1> Hope you are doing better. I'll pray for you.
<user0> I'm doing good now after the chemo and radiation. It is in total remission now.
<user1> Good for you! stay healthy
<user1> Forget that! Eat pizza and enjoy life.
<user0> Oh I definitely do both of those things as much as I can. Pizza = perfection
<user1> I agree, I eat what I want when I want all the time.
<user0> If I had the metabolism to do that, I'd definitely be following your example.
<user0> You have to have fun!
<user1> How can I do that?
<user0> Get drunk and go out!
<user0> I never go to the store anymore, I wish i did.
<user1> Why not? Dollar store has something for everyone.
<user0> Not for me, i shop online mostly these days.
<user1> You ship food to your house?
<user1> Just go for it! Never look back!
<user0> Okay, I'll take your advice! Wish me luck!
<user1> Best of luck my friend, you can do anything.
<user1> I own an animal shelter here in my home town.
<user0> It must be so hard to deal with emotionally at times. Just watching a show makes me want to lash out.
<user1> I try to pass that onto my top doctors to take care of the dogs.
<user1> That's great! I hope she goes to a good graduate school.
<user0> Thank you! Me too :)
<user1> I am very happy for you!
<user1> I am so sorry to hear that she has passed.  How long has she been gone?
<user0> 21 years, but I miss her every single day
<user1> I know how you feel. 
<user1> I have that same problem!
<user0> A friend of mine bought one right after I did one day, mine was a loser, his was a $15,000 winner.
<user1> Holy goodness!!! I would be a bit jealous :(
<user1> Is your friend ok? What kind of car was it?
<user0> He was driving a compact and a truck hit him.  He didn't make it unfortunately
<user1> That is horrible news, I am so sorry for your loss.
<user1> Is that good or bad?  Sometimes extra work can be a blessing, unless you are salaried, then it's just more work.
<user0> Bad if anything, I just hope it isn't overwhelming 
<user1> I hope so too.  What kind of work is it?
<user1> Oh, I am sorry for your loss
<user0> thank you. i am having trouble getting over it.
<user1> Don't feel bad now. What's done is done
<user0> Yes, but I really miss him.
<user1> I can understand. I am really sorry
<user1> Oh no! Was anyone hurt?
<user0> Yes one driver was in critical condition and car ran into the side of the express way it was unfortunate but I was over a hour late for work. 
<user1> That is so sad. I hope they recover okay. Hopefully you weren't in trouble for being late either.
<user1> That is awesome, are they coming to visit you?
<user0> Yes! In October. I haven't seen him in a few months.
<user1> Awesome! I'm not a father yet, but I can only imagine your kids growing up and leaving to live their own lives.
<user0> Yes, I do miss them.  But i am excited to see them get out there and leave their mark on the world.
<user0> Aw, I'm sorry, did you just forget or you were thinking about other things?
<user1> I didn't think he would mind.  But it was expensive, so maybe i should have asked.
<user0> Yeah, had a similar scuffle with my wife, but being married sometimes you just have to forgive and forget.
<user0> I have never liked spiders.
<user1> Me either I screamed so loud lol I be afraid thy may crawl on me I would freak out. 
<user0> You should always have bug spray on you at all times.
<user1> For now on I will.
<user1> That is really scary. Are you home alone?
<user0> Yes! I don't have a gun or anything!
<user1> I'm sure you are fine. I bet it is just a tree branch or something like that. Maybe a neighbor could go look for you.
<user0> I don't have any neighbors, and there are no trees there. 
<user0> YAY, a promotion is always amazing.  when do you start?
<user1> I actually started today it was a lot of information to take in but it was such a joy. 
<user0> Thats amazing, financial stability can be a life changer.
<user0> Maybe they're very eager to go a certain item.
<user1> Maybe. It's that hunter gatherer mentality.  Get it before everyone else.
<user0> True, because regretfully I act that way sometimes too.
<user1> I guess I might too.
<user1> Yeah I hear you! Do you like to read or watch TV?
<user0> Both! I spend more time watching TV though. How about you?
<user1> I like to do both as well. TV if I'm feeling lazy, reading if I feel more ambitious. 
<user0> That's kind of how I am. What kind of TV shows do you like?
<user0> Oh no!! How did you dry them?
<user1> They are still air drying what makes it worse I sat in the sets and it looked like I wet myself lol a little embarrassing. 
<user0> Oh that sounds awful! But at least no one stole anything from your car.
<user0> Did you take it back that is so disgusting. 
<user1> I called them and told them about it. They said the next pizza would be free. I said no thanks.
<user0> I wouldn't want another either it takes one time for me to find hair, bug etc and I am done with the restaurant.  
<user1> Yes indeed.  I think i am done with eating out for a while
<user0> Best way to ensure your food is clean and free of hair cook it yourself.
<user0> That sounds great! I really pays off to be prepared. 
<user1> Yes it does. I was able to eliminate several meal breaks which cut over three hours off my trip time!
<user0> That sounds like some efficient planning! I hope you enjoy your trip!
<user1> Thank you!
<user1> I can understand you. But this is the cycle of life, right? Kids grow and they have to find their own way of life in this world
<user0> Yes you are right at least I have my cats to keep me company lol so I'm not to much alone.
<user1> Good for you. You can also call your friends to hang out if you have close ones
<user1> Oh no, I'm sorry. Did you stay long?
<user0> I was there for 4 days.  I wanted to see Cinderella but I kept missing her.
<user1> Maybe she was around, but it wasn't time for the ball yet.
<user0> Haha, maybe I didn't think of that!
<user0> That's wonderful. He'll be so excited when he finds out!
<user1> Yes he will it's his birthday and we can have a night alone no kids just a nice dinner.
<user0> I hope you guys have a great time. Just the two of you.
<user1> We will thank you.
<user1> Concerts can be a lot of fun! Will you be going to another one?
<user0> Yes if they can outdo Queen Bey lol we saw Beyonce and she put on a awesome show a night to remember. 
<user1> I've never been to a Beyonce concert. Always sold out! I'm glad you got to see her.
<user1> Congratulations! Good to hear your hard work is paying off.
<user0> Yes i am delighted and kinda proud of myself.  I have worked very hard.
<user1> You should definitely be proud of yourself. Pat yourself on the back.
<user0> Thanks! It feels good to be productive.
<user0> Yeah I hope you get it! I'm sure they will recognize the extra time you've been doing.
<user1> i really hope so. I have worked 60+ hours a week for the last 6 months.
<user0> Wow, I hope you're getting paid for all that extra time!
<user1> I am salary unfortunately. But, if i get this new promotion, it will be worth it.  Lots more money.
<user1> Sorry to hear that my friend.. Was she facing an emergency?
<user0> Not really. I dont know what she used it for, she has not told anything to me so far
<user1> I know it sucks, but i think you should have an open conversation to your girl about this
<user1> That is a tragedy! Where do you think you left it? Did you check your pockets?
<user0> i have checked everywhere.  i think my dog may have snatched it.
<user1> Interesting. I hope you do find it. I don't know how you brush your hair.
<user0> i am not brushing it, and it looks a mess. 
<user0> How does that make you feel?
<user1> very very bad, and suspicious.
<user0> I am so sorry to hear you're going through this. Hopefully, it's nothing.
<user1> hopefully.  I have not read the texts, but seen the name pop up.
<user1> Oh, so you always prepare well huh?
<user0> Yeah, i am one of those people who want to know everything is set before starting something
<user1> I always wanted that level of discipline. good for you :)
<user1> Congratulations! boy or girl
<user0> we don't know yet, she is only a few months along
<user1> well, as long as its a happy healthy baby you guys will be fine
<user0> yes that is all i want really
<user1> Yep. Happy and healthy is a blessing
<user1> What's the band?
<user0> def leppard.  they are going to be with reo speedwagon and tesla too.
<user1> Wow. That must suck. Do you like the band incubus? I missed them a couple of times but I saw them this year
<user0> i do, they did a song called wish you were here that i loved.
<user1> yes. I wish I could send you a clip of it from the concert. It was awesome. Maybe you could catch def leppard next time. 
<user1> That sounds really cool.
<user0> Yeah. i felt like i was a child again, standing amidst all those superheroes
<user1> Oh, such great nostalgia. 
<user1> oof that sucks.
<user0> yes.  i wasn't too happy about it.
<user1> yea you shouldnt be
<user0> i questioned him about it and he denied it.  but i caught him red handed.
<user1> well hopefully you find a better path in life
<user1> Oh wow, i did not even know about the transfer. I bet Laker fans are delighted
<user0> They are on cloud 9! With such a legend on their team, who wouldn't be, right?
<user1> So true. I might become a lakers fan myself at this point
<user1> That really sucks. Have you tried taking some melatonin?
<user0> i have tried taking benadryl and some other sleep aid.  i should try melatonin.
<user1> Yeah, it works wonders for me when I can't sleep.
<user1> Oh god.. so sorry to hear that.. May i ask how did Tom pass?
<user0> He was old. He was my childhood dog and he was always with me all the time
<user1> I can feel your emotions. Find peace in knowing that Tom is at a better place now
<user1> Why are you so thankful? Is it Thanksgiving?
<user0> they are very good to me. they are always there for me.
<user1> That's great to hear. It's always good to have a great family support structure when times are hard.
<user1> Oh no, that is a terrible thing to do.
<user0> Yeah.. He always plays pranks, but this one made me furious. I went to him and gave him a punch so that he learns to respect animals
<user1> I applaud your response.
<user1> Oh no!!!  Did it smell bad?
<user0> no just really gross, all warm and mushy between my toes. 
<user1> Ewwwww!  Hope the cat is okay!
<user1> Sounds exciting.  I wish you the best of luck!
<user0> Thank you! I am a little nervous, but I am sure everything will be great.
<user1> Don't worry everyone is nervous on the first day.
<user1> thats an awful thing to do! what did you do?
<user0> I gave him a punch right away. thats no way to treat animals.
<user1> i am so glad that you did 
<user1> oh no.. what happened? did you face a financial loss?
<user0> no my credit is not great and they turned me down for the loan.
<user1> so sorry to hear that.. hopefully things work out for you real soon
<user1> Great! Don't be nervous, be confident.  Works like a charm.
<user0> thank you so much.. i am feel so much anxious about it
<user1> Don't be. Just visualize yourself already having the job.
<user1> Congrats
<user0> thank you! i never expected it, so i was pleasantly surprised
<user1> Was it fun?
<user1> That is no good dude
<user0> yeah. i am thinking about confronting him about it
<user1> You should. and get new friend
<user1> You did! That's so cool!
<user0> Yes! It was only 200 but still, it's more than i had!
<user1> Any free money is great.
<user1> Oh that sounds exciting! when do you go?
<user0> next week. and i am starting next month. i am looking forward to the new city and life
<user1> A new start and a new life, that is exciting! I hope you love it.
<user1> mine too.. the nature is so peaceful and beautiful during the fall
<user0> yes. It is nice to travel to the mountains in the fall. I plan to go to gatlinburg sometime soon.
<user1> i have been there, it is so lovely. you are going to love it
<user1> Ewww. I would have been too
<user0> we were at a party, he had too much whiskey and he unloaded on me like anything!
<user1> Did anyone video it?
<user1> Aw that's awful, how old was it?
<user0> 12. he was old.. but then i cant remember a memory without him in it as well
<user1> I hope you're holding up then, I would be devastated if my pet died.
<user1> yea thank god he didnt go to the GSW
<user0> haha very true.. Lakers fans are so thrilled at the moment
<user1> yea i bet they are
<user1> you have eyes too
<user0> yes i do?
<user1> Have eyes for someone else
<user1> oh yea i know how that feels
<user0> it was my first time staying away from the family. felt dreadful!
<user1> it really does suck
<user1> that movie scared me to death, and i usually dont scare very easy.
<user0> yeah! and to think that i went alone and at night!
<user1> oh my lord!!! how did you sleep that night?
<user1> Oh no!  What happened/
<user0> I have to testify as a witness.
<user1> Okay good.  I think everything is going to be okay!  Keep your head up, friend!
<user1> Im sorry to hear that
<user0> thanks.. She was old, but still, i feel so alone without her
<user1> Was she really sick?
<user1> Eggplant is gross but hey now you know! lol
<user0> Yes! It was so awful, I can't see how people eat it.
<user1> I can't either!  I tried it once and I'm like you......NO MORE!
<user1> That's so messed up! Why was he doing that?
<user0> He plays pranks, but this was way over the line! i went to him and threw a punch at him. i dont think he will be doing that anymore
<user1> Good to hear, how old was he?
<user1> ME too. Marvel movies are the best. Im late I just saw wonderwomAN
<user0> Yeah, and since the infinity war second part is going to answer all the mysteries, it is going to be legendary
<user1> OH my word. I feel like I should watch them all over
<user1> is he sick?
<user0> He was not feeling well last week.. i am really hoping his heart is fine
<user1> Does he has any record with heart problems?
<user1> oh wow that really sucks
<user0> we lost him 5 years ago to an accident
<user1> dang that is rough
<user1> That's so sad! Did he at least die of old age?
<user0> he was hit by a truck.. i cant even imagine it
<user1> I'm so sorry to hear that, may he rest in peace.
<user1> Is that because you just like being organized?
<user0> Yes, i want to be prepared all this time, it is just the way i am
<user1> That is really a good way to be. I need to practice this more, myself!
<user1> Bed is always a source of comfort for me. Especially, after work when I feel so drained and stressed out
<user0> Yes that is the best time.  I like to come home, fix some food, and dive into my bed.  It is such a comfort.
<user1> Indeed. Particularly, when i grab my phone and watch short clips from my favorite TV shows on Youtube
<user1> aw I'm sorry to hear.  Did you conquer your loneliness?
<user0> i did. i had gotten a new job there, and it was my first time being away from my family
<user1> I'm glad you were able to adjust.  It can be lonely without family around.
<user1> oh no.. why are you feeling that way?
<user0> i have to get up at 8 am, and it's already 4. 
<user1> That sucks.. Are you having trouble falling asleep?
<user1> How did that go exactly?
<user0> I saw her coming out of a restaurant. She still looks so gorgeous, such a timeless beauty!
<user1> She is the most beautiful girl I have ever seen.
<user1> i dont blame you! i would have also!
<user0> we were at a party and he had too much whiskey inside him. 
<user1> nasty! did you tell him anything?
<user1> Oh wow! I am so sorry that happened to you.
<user0> Thanks.. i fired her right then and there
<user1> I would have called the cops on her!
<user1> What type of car was it?
<user0> it was a fiat
<user1> That must have been a very big man.
<user0> Surprisingly he wasn't that big. Just powerful
<user0> thats so nice, love when that happens
<user1> yes it was definitely great, and couldn't have come at a better time.
<user0> that nice, good for you
<user0> oh yea whys that?
<user1> i have heard they aren't good quality. They have lots of problems.
<user0> oh that makes a lot of sense
<user0> What do you plan on doing today?
<user1> I plan on going out and conquering the world! I feel like a million bucks.
<user0> I want some of whatever you had for breakfast. You seem very happy.
<user0> Sorry to hear that! Why do you think that might happen?
<user1> They have been laying people off, and the last person started a week after i didn
<user0> Hopefully that doesn't happen, and you have job security.
<user0> That's pretty embarrassing haha. Ever find out what it was?
<user1> I still don't know. I'm sure it was pop or coffee.
<user0> That would make sense, though you could probably have smelt it if it was coffee.
<user0> Oh damn that's so sad. Was it salvageable? 
<user1> Nope, completely destroyed. I will have to buy a new one. So inconvenient.
<user0> It definitely sounds that way, gonna upgrade it?
<user0> oh yea i had those out 2 years ago it sucks
<user1> yes he was pretty pitiful.  funny at first, but then he started hurting. i felt bad for him.
<user0> yea it can be sore and you cant eat anything
<user0> im glad i still have mine around.
<user1> spend as much time as you can with him. you never know when you won't be able to anymore.
<user0> exactly what i do. we were never close growig up. we are now.
<user0> Wow, what is chiller theatre? I'm intrigued.
<user1> it was a show that came on at midnight that would play scary movies. first 3d movie i ever saw was on the show. got the 3d glasses free with a pizza. lol
<user0> Must be fun but unnerving as well. Whats your favourite horror movie?
<user0> What happened to you?
<user1> I was at work one day and I came home and some special people were there
<user0> Your best friends?
<user1> nope my grandparents were in town
<user1> really what kind of sweets did you eat?
<user0> I don't remember the name, but they looked like regular cookies. 
<user1> I love cookies especially oreo's they are my favorite
<user1> That is nice to have good memories.
<user0> yeah I remember going to fun places like Busch Gardens and riding on coasters
<user1> Did you go with your cousins?
<user1> Why is that
<user0> he really was motivated in highsool  high school 
<user1> I was too
<user0> yes but i kept pushing and pushing and he graduated!
<user0> No, I don't get any golden opportunity. did you  ? 
<user1> No we were poor growing up and it always made me sad that we didn't have the opportunity to go
<user0> Don't worry. Earn for it and go!! 
<user0> Oh no. Floodwaters can be devastating. Was there a lot of damage?
<user1> Yes, there was, the town was very damaged. We had sandbagged around our home and managed to save our house.
<user0> Good thing you were prepared.
<user0> Did yall make up
<user1> No,  he had taken credit for my work with our boss.
<user0> That is not good
<user0> Will you get to make it up?
<user1> Doesn't seem like it. My job makes it very difficult to schedule time off.
<user0> I am sure you will find time
<user0> Oh wow, how did he do
<user1> He made their minor league team, and if he does well, maybe the pro team.
<user0> That is so cool
<user0> That sounds like something that could really show off your talents.
<user1> I sure did, I had spent weeks learning the material, and really impressed my boss.
<user0> That's great! Hope your hard work pays off.
<user0> How expensive is that to go to?
<user1> Depends on where you live. I spent 1000 bucks on it
<user0> That is not too bad if you had a good time though
<user0> The loss of a pet is heartbreaking. I know how you feel. How old was Trevor.
<user1> He was 9.. his time hadn't come, but i guess life is that way sometimes..
<user0> Life is hard. But remember he didn't die he went to his forever home.
<user0> Sorry to hear that.  Have you since been able to overcome your loneliness?
<user1> I think so.. i have made some friends. it was my first time being away from family
<user0> I understand feeling like a duck out of the pond.  Glad to hear you've made progress.
<user0> Don't feel nervous, you need to be confident!
<user1> I know.. but i have this feeling inside me that i would screw up
<user0> It's hard to push that feeling away sometimes, I know.
<user0> That's exciting! I'm guessing you're a Lakers fan?
<user1> Yeah i am! We finally have something that unite and rally us behind our team for a season
<user0> What team was he on before?
<user0> I understand that, I will pray for you
<user1> Thank you so much.. I am just hoping not to get any bad news
<user0> That makes sense, I wish you both the best of luck and health!
<user0> How old is he?
<user1> He is 13. He has been a straight A student always.
<user0> Wow, great job so far, kep up the great parenting!
<user0> Wasn't that out a long time ago? It must've been super scary if you still remember it.
<user1> Yeah, it has been a while. I went at night, alone. So you can imagine the impact!
<user0> Wow, I wouldn't have been brave enough to do that!
<user0> Yes, it is hard to see people with things you can't afford to buy for yourself.
<user1> I feel that way about red sports car only though. I have always dreamed of owning one as a kid.
<user0> Yes, I like the color red as well. I have actually own a couple red sports cars.
<user0> It is great to be thorough and prepared. Are you expecting to perform well?
<user1> I know I did well, I had the material all memorized and knew the answers to all the questions.
<user0> Thats nice, i wish you the very best for your results!
<user0> I can see why! That's highly inappropriate.  
<user1> He seems to think otherwise for some reason. I am thinking about reporting him to the HR.
<user0> You should. He is obviously at the very least flirting with you and at worst harassing you
<user0> Oh wow, that is going to be such a sweet experience!
<user1> I hope so. It ended up being the best restaurant we ever went to and it will be nice to rekindle out early romance.
<user0> That is very true. I sincerely wish you both to have a wonderful time!
<user1> thank you, we plan on it.
<user1> I'm so sorry to hear that. Do you have things of hers that remind you of her often? 
<user0> Yeah.. i have kept a collection of her things, just so that she always stays in my life.
<user1> That is beautiful that you have those things of hers. Mothers are very special people.
<user1> I have been to that, it is such a wonderful experience. You are going to love it!
<user0> I absolutely love going to Disney and the festivals at Epcot are such a great experience each time. We go to Food & Wine each year and the seminars are my favorite part! It's so exciting!
<user1> You seem to have a great taste in spending your free time. I wish you get to have a splendid time in there!
<user1> I'm sorry to hear about that. How did he die?
<user0> He was ran over by a truck.. I can't even try to imagine that
<user1> yeah I bet. Im sorry for your loss
<user1> How did you hurt your back?
<user0> I really don't know. I woke up at it was tight then it just kept getting worse as day went on. Its been a week now.
<user1> Ohh wow! I hope it gets better for you
<user0> Me too. My lawn looks horrible and people are starting to think I don't take care of my home i bet.
<user0> Did you ask him to replace it?
<user1> He said it wasn't his fault and it just stopped working. Of course the blade is bent, so I think he might be lying.
<user0> I agree with you there, I would ask him to pay honestly
<user0> That's nice. How  do you like the dog?
<user1> He is my best friend and I think he needs me as much as I need him.
<user0> That is so sweet. My apartments don't allow pets
<user0> That is for sure, especially a smell that just throws you back
<user1> OMG yes! Sometimes it's a sound or just a feeling you get for no reason. It's like comfort food .lol
<user0> Exactly, sometimes I just smell a good barbeque and that brings me back to those summer days as a kid, life is great sometimes
<user0> That stinks. Im sorry to hear that
<user1> Yeah, I was looking forward to sitting on the beach and relaxing.
<user0> I bet! It seems like fun
<user0> Congratulations. Fun plans?
<user1> Just going out to dinner and then a romantic night at the beach.
<user0> Awww. I'm jealous lol
<user0> Awww. Did you keep it?
<user1> Yes, we did. He was so cute we took him in, and now he is 9 years old.
<user0> Thats great. I know he appreciates it
<user0> That's great. I hope you do well!
<user1> Thank you. I think it will be easy!
<user0> Good luck!
<user0> how old was it
<user1> I had her for about 10 years. 
<user0> they live that long ? interesting
<user1> Yeah, they can live to about 14 years if you take care of them right
<user1> How'd that go?
<user0> It went well, I'm pretty sure that I'll get it!
<user1> Well congratulations! That must have been nerve-wracking.
<user1> That stinks. Maybe he is going through something that only new stuff can solve
<user0> Maybe... but still. Now I feel like I need to buy one myself.
<user1> Do it! I bet you deserve it
<user1> Did you make special arrangements so things went smoothly with one car?
<user0> We didn't have many options but the other persons insurance ended up taking care of it all so we got a rental and the car got fixed but i was so scared .
<user1> Well I am glad it worked out
<user1> What did you find?!
<user0> Drugs! I found drugs. I can't believe this.
<user1> Oh no, are you going to talk to him about the dangers of drugs?
<user0> I definitely will. I bet he'll say that they aren't his, but I know better.
<user0> Remind me, which show was that?
<user1> The one with the three cops that can never agree with each other but end up solving the cases anyway. I'm so happy about this news!
<user0> That's so cool!  I'm gonna have to check it out
<user0> That's nice. Are you going to hang it up?
<user1> Yeah, definitely. It brings back really good memories.
<user0> Great, you've found an old treasure.
<user0> I'm sorry. How long had you been together?
<user1> We were together for 3 years. I can't stand being alone.
<user0> Just try and get through each day, one at a time. Don't think too far ahead.
<user0> That sounds scary.  Are you going to investigate?
<user1> I want to, but I'm a bit scared. Maybe I should take something with me to defend myself, just in case.
<user0> If this were a movie, I'd be yelling at the screen for you to leave the house and not go down there.
<user0> I am so sorry to hear that.  Is he planning to retake the test?
<user1> I sure hope so. Otherwise he might not be able to graduate.
<user0> What test?
<user1> It was a math test, it makes up a pretty large part of his grade.
<user1> That's great. Is that your only son?
<user0> Yes, he's my only son. I cant wait until he get's his first girlfriend like I did in middle school. Those were the days.
<user1> I'm sure the memories will be great
<user1> Oh wow! Hopefully no one saw it
<user0> If they did, no one told me about it! So embarrassing.
<user1> Im sorry about that. Ive gone through that before. Laughter can be good medicine sometimes
<user1> What is it called ?
<user0> Oh, I'm sure it's not one that you've heard of. I'm pretty excited though, I've been saving up money for it for a few months now.
<user1> Okay, well I guess I'm happy for you then.
<user1> That's understandable.  How receptive was he to your complaint?
<user0> He wasn't to happy about me confronting him. I told him if it happens again it might get physical.
<user1> Oh, so it got pretty serious.  I guess he needs to learn to respect boundaries.
<user1> Did you find anything?
<user0> Yeah, I found some old toys from my childhood. So many memories came flooding back into my mind.
<user1> I bet that was very nostalgic for you.
<user1> That's a hard hit to take.  Why do you suspect they got it?
<user0> I honestly have no idea. I was definitely more deserving of that position.
<user1> So what are you going to do about?  Are you going to start looking for another place to work?
<user0> I really think that I might.
<user0> What did you mess up?
<user1> It was something for an important client. Now I'm afraid this is going to screw up my career.
<user0> I'm sure you'll be fine.  Have you made many similar mistakes in the past?
<user1> No, this is the first time I've messed up anything like this.
<user0> I wouldn't worry too much about it then.  Don't let it get you down.
<user0> Wow, that's nice. I hope you treated yourself to something extravagant!
<user1> Oh I spent it on a few things. I was just surprised someone didn't find it when it was being cleaned.
<user0> I guess they didn't do as good a job as they should have, lol. Wish my car dealership had missed a few hundred bucks!
<user1> I know! made it not so bad that the car I traded in was a junker and not worth much lol
<user0> Well, it was worth $500! That's about what my car's worth these days - had it for years. Still runs great tho'.
<user0> How fun! In a tent or an RV?
<user1> In a tent. I just have to make extra sure that I pack all of the supplies that we'll need.
<user0> Don't forget a first aid kit! We always need those on camping trips!
<user0> Ugh, that's so annoying.  How long did you have to follow behind them?
<user1> about 5 miles. there was too much trafic in the slow lane, couldn't get over
<user0> I hope you weren't late for anything important!
<user0> memory lane right there! which cartoons? 
<user1> It was a whole bunch of different ones from the 90's. Man, they really reminded me of my childhood.
<user0> Very cool I havent seen the older style cartoons myself in years.
<user0> That would creep me out too what kind of calls?? 
<user1> The person on the other end just keeps making really weird sounds until I hang up. I'm not sure what I should do about it.
<user0> Alright that would creep me out too. Block the number or change yours!! weird. 
<user0> Uh oh. Are you going to confront him about it?
<user1> Absolutely, but it probably won't go well. He needs help but he won't accept it.
<user0> Well I hope that he actually listens to you this time and gets help.
<user0> Congratulations, that's awesome! I hope you're getting a raise too!
<user1> Yeah, a raise will definitely come with it. I've put a lot of work into this, and it finally paid off!
<user0> Hope you treat yourself to celebrate, you deserve it!
<user0> That sounds amazing! When will you find out? 
<user1> Soon. There are several other people trying to get the same position, but I'm pretty hopeful that things will work out in my favor.
<user0> You sound positive so I am sure you will get it!!! 
<user0> omg, that's so scary! are you okay? did you call the police?
<user1> yes we called the police he was arrested! 
<user0> that's good to hear! people are crazy
<user1> really crazy had to go to court, he lied so much 
<user1> I bet.  It is nice to have a day off every now and then
<user0> it definitely is
<user1> I like having days off to do absolutly nothing.  It helps with stress.
<user1> That's the worst.  Is it damaging the curtains too much?
<user0> Yeah, he's tearing them up. I really wish he'd stop.
<user1> Is there anything you can put on them or near them to stop him?
<user0> I'm not sure, but I'm going to try to find something that will do that.
<user0> That is great! Adopt, don't shop! Always a great motto!
<user1> Agreed, that's my motto! This is a high-kill shelter too, so we'll definitely be saving a life :)
<user0> That is great, I commend you!
<user0> Have you prepared enough for it?
<user1> yeah i believe so
<user0> Well Im sure you be fine. Just relax.
<user0> That's good to hear! Have you been eating healthy?
<user1> yes definitely, and getting plenty of exercise 
<user0> That's great! Keep up the good work!
<user0> thats strange, my dog will eat anything lol
<user1> Yeah, that's what I thought about mine too. I bought a huge bag of the stuff, too. It's so irritating.
<user0> maybe he will start warming up to it soon
<user1> I certainly hope so.
<user1> About what?!
<user0> Oh it was just boring work stuff, about a client. But I was really awed by the amount of work that she put into it.
<user1> That's awesome. I'm glad she did well.
<user1> thats always a bummer when you put in such work and get nothing in return 
<user0> Yeah, especially when my boss promised to pay me more. Might be time to quit!
<user1> Oh I just quit a few weeks ago due to a similar situation actually! Never been happier! 
<user1> Did you study for it or are you winging it?
<user0> i feel pretty prepared
<user1> Don't worry then.  You did you part!! I'm sure you will do fine!
<user1> Maybe you should try and have a party?
<user0> That's a good idea. I can't stand being alone in this place much longer.
<user1> Yes being alone is not very fun.
<user1> What will your new age be?
<user0> I'll be turning 35. And some friends are coming that I haven't seen in years, it'll be great to see them again.
<user1> You should have a great time, congrats on the new age!
<user1> I went through a similar thing a few years back.  Everything seemed hollow to me.  How long has it been?
<user0> About two years now and everything still seems very odd to me.
<user1> If your depressed, speak to someone.  If it's just adjusting to the change, that comes in time.
<user1> Why is it that you are in trouble?
<user0> I lost a really important document at work... telling my boss is going to be so embarrassing.
<user1> Can you just replace the document?
<user0> If only it were that easy. It had several signatures on it.
<user0> I would be reporting that to the police for sure. 
<user1> I tried. They said they can't do anything unless he actually tries to physically harm me, which is insane to me.
<user0> Thats true right.. i forgot how stupid the law can be sometimes. Thats insane. 
<user0> Oh no! I am so sorry to hear that. That must be very difficult for you and your family.
<user1> Yes it was. It only took a few short months and my father passed away due to it being inoperable.
<user0> I am so sorry for your loss. I hope that you find peace in this difficult time.
<user0> That's great. What will you be doing at your new job?
<user1> Thanks! Graphic design mostly. At my old job I was a manager and it was horrible.
<user0> Sometimes being a manager is the worst job you can have at a place, you seem to be the one who gets blamed for everything.
<user0> Aw man, that sucks. Promotions usually aren't given fairly in my experience. Was that the case for you too?
<user1> No, the guy that got it was qualified, it's just I really wanted the job. It would have really help my career.
<user0> I'll keep my fingers crossed for you that you get that promotion next time!
<user0> That is amazingly lucky! good for you!
<user1> I almost passed out, I have never won so much money before.
<user0> That is great! I wish I was lucky like that!
<user0> Awh poor baby.. I am sure itll get better now tho! How old is he? 
<user1> He's 8 years old. They're going to have to put him down - turns out he has feline aids :(
<user0> Ugh noooo! Thats terrible i am so sorry. :( 
<user0> I would be so excited! Did they pay you for it? 
<user1> Haven't been paid for it yet, but people that visit are welcome to put in an offer for anything they see! Fingers crossed someone wants mine!
<user0> Hopefully! that would be so amazing! 
<user0> That sounds like such a fun, peaceful morning. So jealous you have a pool, it's been scorching outside!
<user1> Well it's only a kiddie pool, kids are very little. It was a very nice morning.
<user0> Ah okay, nice for the kiddos then. They grow up fast, so hold onto these moments while you can:)
<user0> Aw, well when your younger you don't do those things on purpose. I think everyone is mean to their siblings every now and then.
<user1> True, but she's very sensitive. I'm sure it still bothers her. I try to make up for it today, but I never can take those things back.
<user0> Have you talked to her about it? Maybe she doesn't really think about it anymore.
<user0> I am so sorry to hear about your loss. What did he get you?
<user1> he got my favorite flower, an orchid a card and made dinner 
<user0> That was very nice of him. I'm glad you have a nice husband.
<user1> thanks
<user1> Well better to be sooner than later on something like that. Dont be hard on yourself. 
<user0> Agreed, and it had been 5 months so I figured I was due. The mechanic was really condescending which was what made it embarrassing!
<user1> Thats so silly its none of his worry. He needs to hush up. lol 
<user1> Wow! He sounds like a super smart cat! How did you get him out of there?
<user0> He is! Well, both smart and dumb haha. Had to use a knitting needle to pick the lock!
<user1> Well at least you managed to save him!
<user1> Oh man, I've definitely had a few coworkers like that myself before. What does she even talk about?
<user0> If you make a comment on anything, say cats, she'll go into a monologue about everything she's ever learned about a cat (most of it wrong).
<user1> That's the worst! Some people, once they get started, they just can't stop themselves. It's like opening a can of Pringles.
<user1> Did it feel good to get it out?
<user0> It did at first, until I left the room and saw she was sitting right by the door where she could hear everything! It was humiliating and I felt really bad for her after that.
<user1> Oh no, that's awkward! Did you get in trouble for it?
<user1> That's heartbreaking, but you're amazing for doing that. Cats are my favorite and I've rescued many animals. It's a lot of work.
<user0> They are my favorite, too. I love how independent they are.
<user1> Yes, and when they love you it feels special, because they don't love everyone like dogs do. You've racked up a lot of good karma for saving them!
<user1> I'm there too. Struggling each day. It really gets old.
<user0> I'm sorry we're both in this situation. It really sucks, and it feels unfair because it's not for lack of effort.
<user1> Yeah, that's right. I've been pushing 70 hours working a week for as long as I can remember. Hold out, maybe it'll change.
<user1> You would be so suprised at how much stays all the way in the nooks and crannies of your brain when you take a break!
<user0> I know it was nerve wrecking but studying all the time and i mean al the time paid off 
<user1> Im glad it paid off for you, you must be super proud!
<user1> Oh no, I am so sorry. What did you do?
<user0> To be honest, I fell into a pretty deep depression. No one wanted to hire me. It was tough.
<user1> That is tough. That must have been quite the trying time. Did you eventually find work?
<user0> I did, yeah. And strangely enough, the company hired me back a few years later when they were doing better cashflow-wise. 
<user0> Good, how long has it been since you saw them last?
<user1> about a year and a half!
<user0> I hope you all have some fun.
<user0> Oh yes, fall is definitely my favorite season as well! I love fall scents!
<user1> Me too! Wearing comfy sweaters, snuggling up with a hot drink, and fall smell on the air...can't wait for it!
<user0> It is the best season, by far! Plus, Halloween!
<user0> Oh man, those things are awful and reproduce like crazy.  We left our house for a week and came back to tons of them everywhere! The best trick is putting a little apple cider vinegar in a jar, a drop of dish soap on top of that and cover it with cling wrap and put holes in it.  They will gravitate toward it and you'll catch a bunch! Just keep changing it every few days.
<user1> Thanks for the tip, I will try that! I cleaned out the fridge and most of them seemed to just go away. I have no idea where they go but don't really care either as long as they're gone!
<user0> Seriously, gone is good.  They do have bacteria on them and lay their eggs on fruit and veggies and the larva burrow into the fruit or veggie so its good you trashed it all. Glad you're free of them!
<user0> That is so exciting! It can be stressful and expensive planning a wedding.
<user1> Boy are you right about that. I was really excited during the early planning stages, but it's been stressful ever since.
<user0> It really gets stressful when you get down to the last minute. You are always so worried you are going to forget something.
<user0> oh that was nice of them
<user1> Yeah, they had told my husband about it so he could get me there.
<user0> haha thats pretty fun
<user0> Oh no, I am sorry to hear that. I hope that he gets to feeling better. How old is he?
<user1> Thank you, me too! He's a little over 2 years old. I'd hate to lose him, but they usually don't live more than 2-3 years.
<user0> Oh I see, I can understand your concern. Perhaps he will live longer than most hamsters!
<user0> That is awesome!  I would be really excited if I were in yyour shoes!
<user1> Yes, that's exactly how I felt. I suspected they'd been in trouble for a while so when they asked me to come back and help them out it felt really good.
<user0> I hope you go far in your job!  Good luck!
<user1> Thank you!
<user1> That is quite upsetting. Do you know what ails it?
<user0> no they are at the vet now
<user1> Well I certainly hope that the dog gets to feeling better. Are you close friends with this canine companion?
<user1> Oh no, what happened? Hopefully the whole weekend didn't get ruined!
<user0> Well unfortunately the day before we were due to go my little 2 year old daughter woke up covered in spots.  As the day went on more and more appeared and she had a roaring temperature.  We realised she had chickenpox.  She was feeling so miserable and of course all she wanted was her mummy and daddy.  It was a bit depressing and part of me was devastated but our weekend away was not to be.  Sure kids always come first dont they?!
<user1> Poor little thing, chicken pox are the worst. On the bright side, you still got to spend your anniversary with your husband, just not, you know, in the way you hoped. Hope you guys get to have a make-up weekend soon!
<user0> Very true and thats the way to look at it. I was a bit dispirited but the hotel were great and re-arranged it for us and to be honest I could never have left my baby when she was poorly. The best made plans dont always work out when you have kids, but hey I wouldnt change them for the world.
<user0> Wow thats nice.  What do you drive?
<user1> Well that's the thing, I don't. I bike everywhere. Don't get me wrong, I love my bike and it's a great way to stay fit. 
<user0> You have to think of the positives.  Just because they have a new car doesnt mean their life is great.  They could be watching you wishing they were fit and healthy like you are.
<user1> That is a really good way to put it, I will definitely keep that in mind next time I find myself pining after his car.
<user0> lol and some day you might you buy your own new Tesla, if you feel like it!
<user1> A Tesla with a bike rack!
<user0> Exactly!
<user0> oh thats nice
<user1> im glad it came earlier
<user0> yea i would be to
<user0> Why's that?
<user1> I found some old keepsakes in the basement ealier
<user0> Nostalgia is a weird feeling.
<user0> Nice, what do you have planned?
<user1> Going to the drive-in, out to eat, and probably minigolf. Nothing particularly special, just haven't had fun in awhile!
<user0> Sound great, I'm happy for you!
<user0> Wow!  That must feel great!  You should be proud of this accomplishment.  People can go their whole lives without ever being published!
<user1> It felt amazing to be recognized for my work, and in a publication I respect to boot! 
<user0> Congratulations!  I wish I could be published.
<user1> Well I certainly wasn't expecting it so who knows, maybe one day you will!
<user1> What are some things you will bring?
<user0> I'm not really sure. I think if I write things out that I could possibly need I won't forget anything.
<user1> It's a good idea to write thing down that you might forget.
<user1> What is wrong? Are you okay?
<user0> I'm in a lot of debt thanks to my car needing expensive repairs, and haven't been able to afford it. It's pretty depressing not being able to pay your bills :/
<user1> I am so sorry. I hope you get all the help you need.
<user1> We have been getting a lot of rain as well. I have to mow my lawn so much.
<user0> im not a fan of it at all
<user1> Yeah I know what you mean. I can't wait for the rainy season to end.
<user1> Oh my goodness, I've almost gotten hit while on a bike before and it's terrifying. I'm so glad you're alright!
<user0> I wish people would pay more attention. I try to do my best to follow the rules of the road both when I'm on my bike and in a car.
<user1> Ditto. It's not hard to do, and so many lives would be saved if people would just follow the rules. I'll send good vibes out so nothing bad happens to you in the future!
<user0> Thank you, I appreciate that!
<user0> Wow, congratulations! Have you guys set a date yet?
<user1> Thank you! We're hoping to get married sometime next year, but man weddings are expensive. It may be further off than I'd like!
<user0> Oh I feel you, I used to work in the wedding industry. It's crazy how much it costs even for the most basic wedding.
<user0> I know exactly how that happens. Sometimes the food is just too good to pass up.
<user1> No kidding. Had free refills on a root beer float too, and how could I say no to that?
<user0> Well I say go for it. It is only your birthday once a year. The other 364 days can make up for it.
<user0> Glad to hear you are having a good day. Wish every day was like that.
<user1> me too but we wouldnt appreciate the good days if it werent for the bad
<user0> That is true. It puts things in context.
<user0> That is really awesome! That is so important to be involved in his life like that. 
<user1> It is. And shows that he is listening. 
<user0> It does! Kids can understand things about the bible that most adults overlook. 
<user0> that is frustrating, especially if the weather isnt ideal 
<user1> Exactly! It rained the other day and my package was totally ruined.
<user0> that is unfortunate, im sorry that happened!
<user1> Thank you! At least I was able to get it replaced.
<user1> That isn't good. Are you mad at your friend?
<user0> I was really upset at the time but once I had some time I realized it was an honest mistake. She felt really bad about it.
<user1> Are you going to get another cat?
<user0> When I'm ready, I think yes.
<user0> I feel the same way as well!  I get really excited thinking about decorating and giving gifts!
<user1> Exactly! And the food, and friends. All of it is just so lovely.
<user0> I agree!  Everything that surrounds Christmas makes me smile and feel content.  It makes me thankful for everything good in life!
<user0> That's a great outlook I think. We often lose focus of that very important fact.
<user1> Yes, I don't need anything. I have something to eat and a roof over my head. I really can't ask for anything more.
<user0> That's inspiring to me. I will try to think more like that as well whenever I get stressed in life.
<user0> 8 Miles!? That's very impressive.  I bet I could barely make it a mile!
<user1> Yes, my first time out in 60 days. I impressed my self.
<user0> Have you been a long time runner before that?
<user1> Not really. A few years ago I got tired of being fat so one day I just went out and started running. Two months ago I stopped due to hurting my back surfing. I got the all clear yesterday and went back out.
<user1> I can relate to that!  Yeah, my wife with my credit card, lol!
<user0> It's taken me 11 years to get to this point. Last time I let her have at it. She bought us a trip to mexico on my credit card.
<user1> Haha, I can understand the hesitation then.  But was the vacation at least worth the money?
<user0> It was fun. Adults only resort, all inclusive, private swimming pool off the room but cost 500 a day.
<user0> That's something that takes a lot of contemplation, because it's such a big decision to make. Will the extra money be worth the extra work?
<user1> An extra 40k a year but it would be highly stressful. Currently I have the highest ratings in the USA, I'm sure any new employer would want me to bring them up to that stage as well. 
<user0> Oh wow, an additional 40K is a lot! I'd be willing to put up with quite a bit for a pay increase that large.
<user1> I currently work 50 hours a week. I'd be working around 75-80 a week then.
<user0> Oh wow. I'll be honest and say it wouldn't be worth it for me! What's an extra 40K if you're never not at work to enjoy it?
<user0> Oh wow, I think it'd take me much longer to not bust my butt! That is impressive!
<user1> Yes,  I was surprised. I've been at it my entire life and never seen anyone pick it up so quickly. She is not even athletic.
<user0> Maybe she's more athletic than you think! She might be better than you soon. Better watch out!
<user0> awesome! what kind?
<user1> Tesla, I've had my eye on the model for some time
<user0> oh man those are super nice! all electric is pretty neat
<user0> That's good on his part, how do you feel about it?
<user1> I thought it was amazing he got it, seemed like a tough job to land
<user0> That's awesome, and I agree, the job market is tough now a days.  High paying or not.
<user0> Oh that's no good. Any special reason why they were late?
<user1> The guy just doesn't seem to care
<user0> That's a bad attitude to have. I hope he can straighten up a bit if we wants to keep working there.
<user0> It will be okay. It's always hard making that step, but it's good for your health to do it.
<user1> I'm only going because my insurance gives me a gift card for going. I'm in perfect health. But still ashamed.
<user0> I wish my insurance would give me something like that! It's good to go anyways.
<user0> Have you studied for it?  Always helps to prepare!
<user1> yes i have, still nervous though
<user0> Good luck, I'm sure you will do fine!
<user0> Hey everyone trips up a little. What you need to remember is that you and your wife made a commitment and you should follow through on that. 
<user1> Yea I know. The real issues is that I want to stop again from more tomorrow. 
<user0> It's ok to have a cheat day everyone once in a while, but you can't give in. Be strong!
<user0> You only get to do it once?
<user1> Yes, you turn it in then go in front of a board of people. In my case 10 people. If they don't like it I can't go one to work on my PhD and will need to write another. This one has taken 2 years to write.
<user0> Oh no. I hope it goes well for you. That's a lot of hard work.
<user0> Congrats!
<user1> I was pretty happy, it was long overdue
<user0> Was it more than expected?
<user0> That has happened to me, but with texts though lol
<user1> Yeah I've done that, too. The funny thing is I'm usually pretty eloquent even when I'm drunk so I don't think the recipient even realized I was drunk when I wrote it.
<user0> Did you apologize?
<user1> No, when they responded I just played it off like I meant to send it. Everything turned out fine!
<user0> LOL
<user0> what's wrong with it?
<user1> Engine issues I think, not sure if the car will make it
<user0> can you fix it?
<user0> That is great news. Have you also been working out?
<user1> Not really. I average 10 miles a day walking at work but did that when I was fat as well. I cut out all processed foods and drinks.
<user0> Has it been easy or hard to do that?
<user1> Rough. I used to like Iced tea and now only drink black coffee or water. I miss flavor. Plus it's a lot of work cooking everything.
<user1> did they notice it was missing?
<user0> Not yet, I plan on compensating my friend for what I took
<user1> well at least you are attempting to be honest about it.
<user1> Ohh wow! Are you excited?
<user0> No I'm not going. I don't have time and my family dose not talk to me. I just miss home.
<user1> Ohh that stinks. I dont blame you though
<user1> That's very creepy, did he say anything to you?
<user0> Yeah that's what made it weird, it was kind of like he was trying to hit on me but just awkward. But he was really pushy about it.
<user1> Those are definitely the scary types, they don't recognize social cues at all.
<user0> I hope that's all it was and not that he had some bad motive.
<user0> Ouch!  Did she hurt it or is it a degenerative thing? I hope she can find help with physical therapy.
<user1> Hopefully she will see a doctor soon about it
<user0> Oh good.  Hopefully she'll try to fix it with physical therapy first.  Some doctors love to do surgery right away when its not necessary.  Recommend that she get a second opinion.  Hope she resolves it!
<user0> I've never understood that, it's not like they can't afford to eat since they have a job! Do you know which coworker it was?
<user1> Not entirely sure, I marked my lunch so they knew it wasn't theirs
<user0> Next time bring your lunch in a biohazard bag, maybe they will leave it alone.
<user0> What did you do?
<user1> I blocked her and sent her a long text explaining how angry and disappointed I was. I didn't know what else to do.
<user0> You definitely can't be too careful these days
<user1> You're right. It makes me less likely to trust others in the future.
<user1> how do you know no one goes in if you arent in there?
<user0> Because I work in the same little office alone all day. Today I did not use the bathroom no one came in. yesterday I went twice and each time I went I had someone waiting on me when I got back to my desk.
<user1> ok
<user1> Oh no! That stinks. I've never had a cat specifically because I've never been good with the idea of being able to train them. Plus it seems like you just get the one personality, and they never grow to like you. But I'm biased.
<user0> It's funny you say that, I actually like that about cats. They are independent and not too needy, which sort of describes me! I love my cats... the peeing on my bath mat aside.
<user1> Yeah, I know they definitely suit some people. I actually now technically have one... my roommate wanted to get one, and I felt too bad to say no. And he actually is a pretty nice guy, mostly because he's been affectionate from the start. So, we'll see how it goes! Sorry again about your mat.
<user0> Here's hoping your cat grows on you, they have a funny ability to do so.
<user0> Wow good for you! I hope that it works out for you!
<user1> Thanks! The work isn't terribly exciting but it felt good not having to negotiate knowing the client wanted me to do work for them.
<user0> Yeah and I bet the higher paycheck will make the work worth it. 
<user1> That always makes it worth it to be honest!
<user1> What! First of all, are you alright?
<user0> Yeah, I'm fine, the car was parked
<user1> Oh, well that's something, at least. I can't believe people are such cowards, though.
<user1> That's great. Do they know?
<user0> They have no clue. They know I ask them to do more then others but are clueless. I'm excited for them and the also the stress load they will take off of me. 
<user1> Well that is awesome. I bet they won't let you down in the new positions either
<user1> I have never run a marathon
<user0> No better time to try then now.
<user1> You can try your best and if you don't finish there is always the next one
<user0> I will not run If I can't finish. I'm stubborn I'll finish or kill over.
<user1> Well that's some sort of motivation lol
<user1> Congratulations!  What are you getting your PhD in?
<user0> Astrophysics
<user1> Oh geeze, I didn't know I was talking to a genius.  How long is the program?
<user0> I have another 3-4 years then I'll go into teaching.
<user0> Have you tried to talk to your teacher?
<user1> No it's mostly I feel behind on my thesis. When I started they told us keep up or drop out. I should have known, it's one of the hardest schools to get into.
<user0> What school is this you are talking about?
<user1> Cornell University, after this year I transfer to Princeton for my PhD
<user1> That's pretty cool that you're motivated and excited to start it. Most people would be scared and procrastinating. You'll do great.
<user0> I need to get it over. I need to start paying back student loans. It's the last thing I need to do before I can get hired as a Ad Professor. 
<user1> Sounds like you have a plan laid out. It also sounds like you've already accomplished so much.. You should be very proud. I'm with you, I have over $40,000 in student loans. Such a crazy pressure on someone right when they graduate. Good luck!
<user0> I've been paying on mine and have 75 still to pay. Then I want a PhD so that will be another 50k
<user0> I can understand that.
<user1> I know he has to spend time with others but I get envious I want every minute spent together I'm spoiled lol.
<user0> You must love him very much, that's good.
<user1> I do best feeling ever.
<user1> Aw, it takes time! Making friends isn't always so easy so give it a little bit of time
<user0> Yes, but how do I even talk to people I don't know?
<user1> The best thing to do is join clubs and get involved. You generally make friends by association!
<user1> that is really nice of you to do, not a lot of people help others like that anymore
<user0> Yeah thats true most people don't.  I love helping those in need it's a great feeling
<user1> same with me if i ever see someone that could use my help, i will most likely bring it to you
<user1> Ah dang... Sorry that happened to you. It stinks too because a lot of the time that stuff is just decided by who is liked more, or who has better connections, and not actual merit. If you're good, I'm sure you will get recognized at some point.
<user0> Agreed, it's a popularity contest!
<user1> Well, keep a good attitude. If you like the work and the job, hopefully that will be enough.
<user1> Thats very sad to hear im sorry that happened to you 
<user0> Thank you, what should I do about it?
<user1> I would suggest moving on time heals all wounds
<user1> Did she say thank you?
<user0> Yes she did thank me 
<user1> What a lovely woman, and you're lovely, too!
<user1> That's the worst! What did you do?
<user0> Well I'll tell you what I didn't do. I didn't go back to sleep, due to the noise. I think I'm going to have a word with him later.
<user1> That sounds like a good idea. I hope you solve the problem quickly!
<user1> Yeah, those were better times. Brings back good memories.
<user0> Maybe we can relive such times through our children.
<user1> Well, maybe yours. Mine just want to sit inside and play on their phones all day.
<user1> Oh man..I have had those too..and where I am the one getting crap even though I do my job and everyone elses..I HATE sitting around at work...I either want to work or go home. I hope your boss knows your co-worker is lazy?
<user0> We are on the same page I have to pick up their slack and it just irritates me to the upmost it's like just quit please or give me a raise for doing double work. 
<user1> I AGREE and frankly if your boss does not see this and doesn't give you praise then I would quit as well or contact human resources! This kind of stuff is not acceptable.
<user1> sounds like you ate a delicious dessert, what did you eat?
<user0> It was chocolate ice cream dipped in crushed cookies, marshmallows, and chocolate sauce which had frozen to a crisp!
<user1> that sounds delicious i love chocolate cake i think that would be my favorite dessert
<user1> O? That's a brave and noble decision.
<user0> Yeah, she's been pretty sick lately. I want to make sure she's here where she can get all of the care that she needs.
<user1> That's hard but great of you to do, good luck.
<user1> Where will you be shopping?
<user0> I think I'll go to Costco and Walmart.
<user1> Nice! Do you have anything in specific you want to buy?
<user1> hahah it whas happened to me it the worst thing
<user0> It really is! :(
<user1> did you still eat it? or did you throw it away
<user1> That's nice of them! People stopped doing that for me once I got older. I miss them
<user0> I was amazed they even did that but very grateful I haven't had anything in a while also so you wasn't alone your family will do something and you will enjoy it. 
<user1> Well, I'm happy for you :) It shows that they care
<user1> Thats horrible! Im so sorry to hear that.  Why would she do that?
<user0> Im not sure what should i do though ?
<user1> It depends, if you love her, you could try to work it out.  Or you could cheat on her too
<user1> O yea? I
<user0> It's amazing how quickly the dog responds to the commands. My friend must really know what he's doing.
<user1> I'm trying to teach mine tricks myself* I think that's fun to watch!
<user1> I've cheated on occasion. It's never right but it's easy. At least you're ashamed of it.
<user0> Yeah... I'm thinking about coming clean about it to my professor before he finds out on his own.
<user1> That's your decision to make, but I think it would at least put you in control of the situation.
<user1> That sounds fun. Is it a special occasion?
<user0> Not really, just felt like going out. I'm thinking about ordering something I haven't had before, but.... I don't know. I'm weird about trying new foods.
<user1> I understand. Sticking with what you know seems safer.
<user1> you must be loving it
<user0> I am, You never know what shape a used car really is until you have it for a while.
<user1> true that, you cant be too sure until you use it
<user1> Tough week ahead. Do you think you have met your expectations thus far?
<user0> Oh yeah. I'm pretty sure the review is going to go well. I might even get a raise!
<user1> Sounds good. Your supervisor must proud of your work and your displayed high self-esteem
<user1> Oh no! That has so happened to me before! It was only by a couple dollars a month but I SO needed those couple of dollars at the time. I would be MAAADDD
<user0> I am, it went up 20 dollars. 
<user1> Call the bank and get it fixed ASAP! That's got to be so annoying for you!
<user0> I have to go over the paperwork, it may be because my insurance went up.
<user0> I buy those like twice a year and never win.
<user1> I won $200!
<user0> Wow! That's awesome! What did you do with it?
<user1> I blew it on online video games, lol.
<user0> Hey, why not? It's unexpected money!
<user1> That is always the best kind.  I still won't be buying lottery tickets, lol.
<user0> Yeah I feel like you get lucky once then it's all downhill from there.
<user0> Where was she?
<user1> In a spare bedroom with her ex, laying on the bed and kissing him.
<user0> Does she have a new ex now?
<user1> Worked out for the best, she was honestly a pain anyways.
<user1> I would not put up with it either 
<user0> I love the rain.  It makes everything feel fresh.
<user1> i love when the rain his the soil in the open field , the smell of wet dirt is just refreshing
<user0> I agree.  It hasn't rained here in weeks.  I miss the raing.
<user0> I bet you are. What are you going to do? 
<user1> take my dog to the park and meet up with some friends!
<user0> sounds like a real good time i hope you enjoy it 
<user0> Why is that 
<user1> i fell behind on things i needed to get done
<user0> You will be alright buddy
<user0> What have you done this year if you dont mind me asking?
<user1> ive gotten a lot of work done and spent time with friends and family
<user0> That is great, well there is still time to go this year!
<user0> I love it when it's nice out. Are you going to do something outside?
<user1> yes, im going to the park later this afternoon!
<user0> That sounds great. A nice long walk in perfect weather. There's hardly anything better.
<user0> Are you excited for him or jealous? lol 
<user1> Well, I can't help but feel like he only did it to make me feel inferior.
<user0> I feel you! I know its hard having siblings sometimes! Go buy a toy car and park it on top of his. 
<user0> Can you report the caller?
<user1> I should be able to. I recognized the voice, it's someone that I used to know.
<user0> Be sure to do it, otherwise they could keep harassing you
<user0> What class is it for?
<user1> chemistry
<user0> I never took chemistry. Do you feel prepared for the test?
<user1> yes!
<user1> That's great.  Have they always been as supportive as they are now
<user0> yes i have been very fortunate
<user1> nice.  what do you do for a living
<user1> Have you thought about spraying your garden?
<user0> I thought about it but they were coming from the grass around it and I'm worried the dog would get sick if I sprayed the grass
<user1> Perhaps there is an all natural remedy you could try
<user0> Hopefully. there were so many I thought I was in a jungle.
<user0> Same here, I'm in Texas.  Where are you located
<user1> in the midwest!
<user0> Nice! I used to live in St. Paul, MN.  Weather's like a tundra which is why I'm down here
<user0> Were you able to get inside fast?
<user1> No. I was in the middle of the yard and it was sunny, next thing I know it's pouring down rain and I'm soaked.
<user0> Oh wow! That would be annoying!
<user0> How did they get off work midweek?
<user1> thats just their normal schedule
<user0> That would be nice but not fun that you don't have the same days off.
<user0> where is your favorite place to go?
<user1> I just love going, when it gets closer to when we are leaving I look forward to it.
<user0> i can imagine, i hope you have a great time this year
<user0> I remember when my first child started, I was a nervous wreck.
<user1> They sent out an email saying that he may end up with a substitute teacher until they hire someone. 
<user0> So they don't even have teachers yet? Wow, that's crazy.
<user1> It is! And we are paying for the school, I'm not to happy.
<user1> Have you tried getting out and meeting new people?
<user0> No, it is difficult to meet people in my area because I like in a farm. I only talk to the animals
<user1> What about online friends?
<user0> Can you be my online friend?
<user0> that would hurt my feelings. are you alright?
<user1> I'm fine, just disappointed mostly
<user0> i totally understand that. i'm sorry.
<user0> That sucks! Did you have a spare on you?
<user1> No, but I was able to get it towed easily enough
<user0> That is good to hear.
<user0> That's understandable. What kind of project was it? Were you involved?
<user1> It was a major work project, I stepped in to help him
<user0> That's so generous of you. It's people like you that make the work week bearable!
<user0> That's okay, I'm 25 and still in college. How did it go for you? 
<user1> It went pretty well! I got great grades and made friends despite the age difference.
<user0> That's awesome. I'm glad it worked out well for you. :)
<user1> Thank you! In the end I had no reason to worry about it.
<user1> Oh wow. I would have been so scared. more of a stranger than the storm
<user0> Well, she was really nice and we had been waiting together in the snow for awhile, so I felt I could trust her.
<user1> Well that was nice. How long were you stuck there
<user1> Did the ads bring up good memories I hope?
<user0> Yes! Especially the ads for toys I haven't thought of in years, like Boglins.
<user1> I have absolutely no idea what Boglins are, but I'm sure they were awesome!
<user1> Sounds frightening! Was this off the coast of a beach or something?
<user0> Yes, Martinique Beach in Nova Scotia. The currents are very strong.
<user1> That is one of my greatest fears. Did you have to swim sideways from the current to escape?
<user0> Yes that's right! I was a strong swimmer so we made it.
<user1> Great to hear that you made it out ok!
<user1> Well, I can understand that. It's very hard to be on a very strict diet, without a break here and now!
<user0> It is my coworkers said they was going to Burger King and I couldn't resist I feel so bad and guilty.
<user1> Well, i am sure you are disappointed, but all you can do now is just get back on the diet again and try to be more dedicated. It's hard, I know!
<user1> Is this a career change?
<user0> Yes I am going for nursing I can't wit I am over joyed going to be hard work but I got this.
<user1> Oh hey, I'm a nursing graduate! It'll be difficult at first, but you'll get the hang of it.
<user0> That is great to know I can't wait soon will be like you.
<user0> Aw, that sucks. Did you give her a proper burial?
<user1> Yes we did my mom loved her so much especially when me and my brither moved out she is hurt and down so bad.
<user0> Awwww, I am so sorry. Have you thought about getting a new pup?
<user1> Thank you and yes but I want to give her time to heal hopefully by Christmas she will be a little better and open to it.
<user1> Yea, a new job is useless pretty stressful.
<user0> I would say I was more nervous then anything I think the new setting was over whelming but a month later I feel a lot better now. 
<user1> It will be ok in the end.
<user1> Oh that is a real bummer. Were you hurt?
<user0> Yeah it was! No luckily nobody got hurt thanks. The worst part was actually having to talk to the insurance company
<user1> Ok glad you did not get injured. I hope your car gets fixed.
<user0> Thanks! Yeah it will be fine i'm sure. I just hate having to deal with the insurance, but at least I had insurance!
<user0> Sorry to hear that
<user1> Thanks, it's ok though! It got settled and i'm happy
<user0> Well that's good. You never know what to say in that situation
<user1> Yeah I know what you mean! It was hard at the time but i'm a lot happier for it now
<user0> I wish yo the best
<user0> That must of been fun to go through.
<user1> It was brilliant.  My mum must have gathered it up over the years.  I spent hours going through it all.  it made me feel so nostalgic.  I think its a great idea though, I might start doing it for my kids.
<user0> That is cool. Is your mother still alive?
<user1> No sadly so i didnt even know it was there.  Was definitely a wonderful surprise to find it.
<user1> What was?
<user0> I had a lull in work and the store was empty, and there was nobody in there for an hour.  I was about to go insane.
<user1> Really? Did you manage to cope?
<user0> First it was just boring then I started to actually get pretty lonely.  I saw if there was something I could read while I waited.
<user1> And was there?
<user0> Yeah there was a magazine or two.  I got by
<user1> Good
<user0> im sorry to hear that
<user1> Thanks. I still think about him all the time.
<user0> you ever ever plan to get another ?
<user1> I had two at the time so I still have one cat now :)
<user1> Really, how did they do it?
<user0> They started an irrigation sprinkler business with just a few contracts and its blown up and now he's handling large companies
<user1> Amazing! Well done to him.
<user1> Well done, at least you will sit in your room excited and relaxed now
<user0> Exactly. It was so dang hot today, too.
<user1> Heat wave is getting so terrible theses days. I even watched on CNN that the whole of New South Wales is experiencing a drought, so sad
<user1> That sounds unfortunate. You must have been so annoyed with him!
<user0> I was! He had an uncanny knack of blocking me and taking up the whole width of the aisle.
<user1> People like that should just do shopping online instead of ruining the experience for everyone else!
<user1> Do you have daughters of your own?
<user0> No I do not, and probably never will.
<user1> Why is that?
<user1> yea traffic sucks
<user0> Unless there is good music playing.
<user1> well yea thats true
<user1> Same here. It reminds me of my childhood for some reason.
<user0> Yes, the smell especially.
<user1> Exactly, i am overcome with nostalgia and get tears of joy sometimes. 
<user1> I bet! Did it turn out nice?
<user0> Yes, I had a good time.
<user1> That's good... I can't wait for my vacation!
<user1> That's terrible! Did the dog survive?
<user0> Yes, the dog turned out to be fine, kid said he was training he her to be stronger.
<user1> Maybe someone should train the kid to be stronger... by beating him up!
<user1> What I do is to write all the good things I did within the week, I think you should do the same
<user0> it's a good idea, but we should also write our mistakes, to not repeat them in the future.
<user1> i agree with you buddy
<user1> You must have prepared really well. Did the trip go well?
<user0> yes the plane ride was smooth and no delay's and we got a nice rental van
<user1> Sounds like the trip went well. I am glad you enjoyed it!
<user0> Thanks I hope to go again soon
<user0> all the time
<user1> I really wonder why this things happen.
<user0> its just life
<user0> Nice, what breed is the puppy?
<user1> he's a goldendoodle which is a poodle and golden retriever mixed
<user0> I have never heard of such a breed. Must be so cute! 
<user0> i do that all the time. i live on the mexican border. what border did you cross?
<user1> I think I was flying to Philippines, but they let me in, which was a relief. 
<user0> glade all was well
<user0> Cool! How did it go?
<user1> it went well above my expectations
<user0> Great! I hope you get the job. I'll be rooting for you!
<user1> ya i am pretty sure that i will get offer letter soon
<user1> He sounds pretty strong. Any reason in particular that he did that?
<user0> My guess would be because he was drunk. It was still quite the sight to see.
<user1> No kidding. Definitely some quality entertainment for dinner time!
<user1> That must be so exciting!
<user0> My wife is so happy. She has never seen the ocean before.
<user1> I hope you both have a great time!
<user1> oh how does it go
<user0> I thought I did pretty well because I practiced days in advance, looked up information and everything, but I didn't get it.
<user1> its ok you tried your best 
<user1> Well that is great and sad all at the same time. How far away did she move?
<user0> we live in texas she moved to newyork area, since then i am missing her presence in the home and feeling little low
<user1> Aw well that is normal. I'm sure she didn't want to leave. Every day will get a little easier.
<user0> ya but i am getting to know day by day now that how well i am missing her company
<user0> Oh my goodness, that sounds terrifying.
<user1> It was. We were in the basement and it sounded like a freight train was going over the house.
<user0> I'm glad that you are okay.
<user0> i bet that was quite the blast from the past
<user1> It was!  It was a bit bittersweet, though. They grow up too fast.
<user0> yes they do. mine are already out of college
<user0> Oh, are you going on a trip?
<user1> We went on vacation to see my family in another state. I was very happy to be going.
<user0> That sounds like a fun time.
<user0> That is so nice of them!
<user1> I had no idea till I walked into the office with my boss on lunch. I was completely shocked.
<user0> I am so happy for you! Congrats!
<user0> Really?
<user1> Yeah.  It was great to get away from work and family pressures for just a bit, and to enjoy some peace and quiet.
<user0> That's fun
<user0> Oh no! I'm so sorry! It's so difficult to lose a pet.
<user1> He was more than a pet, he was truly my best friend.
<user0> I hope in time you are able to feel better.... and that your heart will be filled with happy memories.
<user0> That's awesome! Happy belated birthday! What did she get you?
<user1> she presented me my dream bike its ducati
<user0> Sweet! I really like Ducati's they are beautiful bikes.
<user1> i feeling very happy and overwhelmed that she presented me my dream bike.
<user1> Did it rain a lot?
<user0> It really did. Also, there were over 20 confirmed tornado touch downs in my county alone.
<user1> That must be really scary to go through.
<user1> That sounds like fun! What happened?
<user0> I wasn't feeling good so she drove, but she drives kind of fast. Usually I don't let anyone drive my car.
<user1> Yeah- I understand that. I don't let anyone drive my car, either. I hope everything worked out okay!
<user1> That seems like it would be a little awkward to me..
<user0> They saw a post I'd made about losing my job and messaged me. I'm going to embroider them something as thanks.
<user1> Well, they sound like they are actually just a nice person trying to help you out, that is really nice.
<user1> That's always a nice find.
<user0> Yes it was. It was really great seeing all of those fun times with my family from the past.
<user1> I bet it was! I love looking at photo albums
<user1> That is nice. Did you start playing guitar with him?
<user0> I tried, lol.  I recently heard him play for the first time in over a year.  His skill levels astounds me.
<user1> That is good.
<user1> I am also working from home from time to time. I could feel some time lonely.
<user0> I'm sorry to hear you are in the same boat sometimes. Do you have any advice on how to make it feel less lonely? 
<user1> I usually get out after finishing work to feel less lonely.
<user1> Oh, that must have been so embarrassing. 
<user0> The sad thing is I do stuff like that all the time :(
<user1> I'm sorry it happens to us at times.
<user1> Congratulations! That is so cool!
<user0> Yes, it's the most money I  have ever won on a lottery ticket. It was very shocking.
<user1> I hope you have fun with that money.
<user1> I can't believe your coworker would do that to you! Did your manager listen?
<user0> Yes he did. He knew that the other guy had been at a different job site, I will still not very happy about the situation.
<user1> I wouldn't be either. Are you going to try to talk to your coworker about it?
<user1> OH wow! I bet you all had a blast!!
<user0> Yes we did they loved it it was such a thrill and the shows and rides was so fun.
<user1> They will really appreciate that when they are older and look back on it. 
<user1> oh god, what do you do at that time
<user0> Well, I did my best to save what I could. A lot of irreplaceable things were destroyed however, photos among other things.
<user1> how did you feel at that time
<user1> Oh wow! Are the babies ok?
<user0> They are fine. I put some tree branches over it to give it some protection from predators and the elements 
<user1> Good thinking. I'm sure the parent bunnies appreciated that.
<user1> Oh man. What a bummer!  I love cucumbers and hummus!  Do you have anything else you're growing that survived?
<user0> My tomatoes and peppers are doing really well for starters. 
<user1> Oh good, I'm glad the entire garden didn't get ruined.  I would love to plant a garden one day soon since I went vegan plant based about 3 months ago.  Happy tomato eating to you!
<user1> Oh what a mess. I would hope that they picked it up.
<user0> they did as soon as they got home and saw it
<user1> Well at least they cleaned up after. I would have been more annoyed if they didnt.
<user1> Could you tell me what you have done?
<user0> i put a lot of work into my small business im starting and spent a lot of time with friends a family so far
<user1> That sounds great, I hope you succeed.
<user1> That's great news! Congrats! My garden is not doing great this year. Do you grow anything else?
<user0> I grow a few other things. Green beans, tomatoes, cucumber, melons, and a few other things 
<user1> Yum. I wish I had a green thumb. 
<user1> That's awesome, It is very hot where I live, so I am jealous!
<user0> it has been really hot here too
<user1> Well I'm glad you get to enjoy some nice weather for a change!
<user1> where exactly are you cos it rained all through in my area?
<user0> midwest
<user1> ok im at the south east
<user1> ohh wow! That's not cool
<user0> They didn't stick around or anything and it's going to be pretty expensive to have it all replaced.
<user1> I wish people would take responsibilities for their own actions
<user1> Oh man! Hopefully nothing broke! 
<user0> nope but i did have to chase down a few cans that rolled away lol
<user1> At least it sounds like you recovered everything! 
<user1> He accused me of stealing from him
<user0> who did
<user1> Sorry, that was an error! Any way over to your conversation.Who did you cut off that made you feel bad?
<user1> Yea I hear ya. Im stuck here at work for another day too.
<user0> same here, but the weekend will be fun
<user1> I just hope it doesnt rain this weekend.
<user1> What is the test on? Have you prepared for it? I bet you will do better than you think!
<user0> yes i have studied quite a bit, thank you!
<user1> Good for you! I bet you will do amazing. Best of luck!
<user1> i feel the same one and lately it seems to be getting worse. i've never been brave enough to go eat alone.
<user0> Yes, that is why I am in front of my computer all day.
<user1> i get that. i work all day then come home to the same routine everyday.
<user1> Me too! I'm stuck inside at work and hearing about how great it is out there.
<user0> im looking out the window waiting to go out lol
<user1> Haha, same! Just one more hour for me. Hope you can enjoy it soon!
<user1> That is not good, what happened
<user0> His boss felt he was under-performing.  It's a shame because he was fun to work with
<user1> That is never a good thing, I hope they land on their feet
<user1> How did they do that?
<user0> He was more skilled than I thought
<user1> Oh, well that is a nice surprise though!
<user1> That is nasty, how do they get away with that?
<user0> Right I was so sicken I said yes this will be the last time I go to this Pizza Hut it's like would you want someone to do you and your food that way.
<user1> Exactly, I would report them, so nasty
<user0> I did first thing the next morning.
<user0> How so?
<user1> Strange noises and grinding, I hope it doesn't break down
<user0> I hope so too, get it checked out!
<user0> Sorry to hear that. It would really upset me to be in that situation!
<user1> Thanks, I will buy another one!
<user0> I hope you win that one! Good luck!
<user0> I am sorry for your loss, at least you got some time together
<user1> Yes and thank you I know he is close in spirit I get emotional sometimes but the memories we had was great.
<user0> I feel that way about my grandma, it is sad that by the time we are born they are so old
<user1> The time just slips away have to cherish the time we have with them.
<user1> I think lyft is better
<user0> I'll have to try them my Panera was over a hour late and my lunch was over once it arrived. 
<user1> I would hate that
<user1> Where to?
<user0> Out of state, it's a shame because we were good friends
<user1> oh, I am sorry to hear that, why did they move away?
<user1> They sounds very complicated
<user0> He's very talented with tools, it'd probably take anyone else half a day at least
<user1> That is nice to have
<user1> having friends over is always nice!
<user0> Yeah, he's a good friend, it'll be a lot of fun when he arrives
<user1> i bet. hope you all have a fantastic time!
<user1> How do you feel about that?
<user0> He was the last person I expected to see
<user1> Are you guys in good relations?
<user1> did it bring back a lot of old mermories?
<user0> Yeah, I've come a long way
<user1> thats good that you have progressed
<user1> She is a crappy person, flirting with someone who is in a relationship. Good on you- stand up guy
<user0> It's been hard though, I've had many girls interested in me lately
<user1> Lol- Well poor you. I have always had guys doing the same and it means nothing to me. If I am in a relationship..or heck even when I am not..I don't get interested in random people generally. I have to know who someone is..Remember that- what lasts is WHO someone is...Someone you want to grow old with..Bodies won't last.
<user1> That must of been weird. Who was it?
<user0> It was a doll someone put next to me
<user1> Was it suppose to scare you?
<user1> thats awesome
<user0> yah, we are always happy
<user1> Well I hope it lasts forever
<user1> That's good! I guess you studied a lot?
<user0> yah, been studying for a while now.
<user1> That's good. I am sure you will do great on it.
<user0> 5
<user0> Ouch, that sounds pretty gross!
<user1> yah, it felt so distigusting
<user0> I'd avoid that taxi driver again if you have the chance.
<user0> I hope it was maybe the weight of the muscle that the scale was picking up.
<user1> I hope so,i  got a little discouraged.But i will keep working out
<user0> Yes, don't let that stop you. Also pay attention to what you eat as well. It's even more important than the exercise portion.
<user0> I don't know whether that's a good or bad thing. Which is it?
<user1> It's good, I just meant that I can be by myself and feel alright.
<user0> That's great! It's definitely a good thing when you can be yourself.
<user0> What was it I wonder?
<user1> I don't even want to remember that smell.
<user0> It must've been nasty like puke
<user0> I like that philosophy. Here lately, has it been easier or harder to stay positive?
<user1> Let's put it that way, even when it's harder I still remain positive.
<user0> I like that, how long have you felt this way about life?
<user0> wow, its good to warm
<user1> Yes, warmth is better than cold.
<user0> it is easier to walk around when its sunny also
<user0> What exactly did he do>
<user1> he tried to take my Driving licence by force on over speeding claims which was not true
<user0> Yes, some people have to stay away form law enforcement jobs.
<user0> Wow! I bet you two are very excited! 
<user1> We are, it will be our first vacation together since we got married.
<user0> That is wonderful. Our first vacation after getting married was full of fun, sun and adventure. Those are the best! 
<user0> You sound very confident. That's good
<user1> I can't imagine getting a fail for a second time.
<user0> I know what you mean. Just believe in yourself
<user0> Is he being too noisy?
<user1> Yeah, that's the problem. On weekends he likes to start hammering and sawing at 5am.
<user0> I see how that can be annoying, have you asked him to stop doing that?
<user0> You weren't excited about it?
<user1> Well I had been waiting for weeks and was unaware, but at the end of a stressful day I checked my mail and the letter came in to let me know if I got in or not. 
<user0> I understand. Stress is a definite mood killer
<user1> I agree, but then I opened the letter and it ended up being the best day of my life! 
<user1> ive always wanted to have the eye surgery. im ready to get rid of my glasses and contacts
<user0> Just do I already know it the best thing I've done for my body.
<user1> im glad you feel happy about it
<user1> It's good to believe in good things.
<user0> that's right in the end everything will be fine
<user1> Yes, I like your attitude. 
<user1> it's true there's nothing like the good old days
<user0> Of course, only for the people that lived through them
<user1> i'm glad you were one of them!
<user1> I know how you feel. Do you have a big trip planned once you receive your passport?
<user0> Yes, I have some big plans to fill those blank pages.
<user1> I hope you enjoy your adventures!
<user1> I hear you. I had the same experience after just 5 years
<user0> It was so strange without her and the kids here at the house.
<user1> I understand. She took my daughter with her
<user1> What subject are you trying to pass?
<user0> maths 
<user1> I love math, good luck with your exams than.
<user1> why were you acting like that?
<user0> I don't know, woke up in too good of a mood I guess.
<user1> i'm glad you were in a good mood.
<user1> Did they say or do anything specifically to you that made you feel that way?
<user0> Not really, maybe just a bit, it's how they said it I guess.
<user1> I understand how that can make you feel a certain way. Unfortunately, there are those types of people around every corner.
<user1> Oh Wow! 20 years at your job! You must be well liked there. 
<user0> I like to think I am. I had no idea this was going to happen.
<user1> It must have been a wonderful surprise for you.
<user1> Oh my goodness, what was the terrible news?
<user0> She called and told me our brother had been in a terrible accident and that we needed to come to the ER immediately. 
<user1> I am so sorry, I hope your brother ended up being okay.
<user0> No he passed away that day. I will never forget the day after my 28 birthday. It was pretty aweful.
<user0> Dang, that's not good. What did you end up doing??
<user1> I stormed into his house like a mad man,i was not having it.That had to stop.
<user0> Oh wow. Did the police get called? I hope you didn't get in trouble. 
<user0> Yeah? What is changing?
<user1> i'm going on a holiday soon!
<user0> Brilliant. here are you going?
<user1> bora bora
<user0> Amazing! and Exotic
<user0> That's so generous of you. The world could use more people like you.
<user1> Yes during on of my clinical rounds I was able to handle pediatric patients which I felt so happy to do. 
<user0> Caring for both the young and the old. Any hospital would be lucky to have you on staff!
<user0> Oh my, how did she react?
<user1> she was confused because i showed up a week late
<user0> Ha! Do you feel bad about it?
<user1> i am so embarrassed.
<user1> It certainly can. What type of job are you looking for?
<user0> Well I went on 4 interviews to work in a clinic and all went well, but they have not called me back and its been a week now. 
<user1> Maybe they had lots of other candidates to see
<user0> Yeah, but bills are coming up so its making me very worried and nervous. 
<user1> I know that feeling. Something will come through though
<user0> Yeah maybe if at least one calls me than my patients well let up. I cant stop waiting next to my cell phone. Each call I get I get excited. 
<user0> Yes! I feel like the day escaped me. Have you done that recently?
<user1> Yes, I am thinking to do it again today though. 
<user0> It is Friday, that would be a nice way to start the weekend!
<user0> Ugh I can imagine. But your time will come, be patient!
<user1> yeah but i really need a break
<user0> Have you tried yoga? It can help in the meanwhile till you get a proper vacation.
<user1> i haven't, i guess i will do that.
<user1> Oh no! Did you get the surgery?
<user0> I did and what an experience. I was alone in the hospital getting prepped for a major surgery not knowing if I was going to make it. 
<user1> But you have recovered now. Right?
<user0> Yea everthing is going well, but it still sends chills down my spine
<user0> Are you pregnant? 
<user1> Yes after several attmpts me and my wife are finally expecting. This news is the best that I have heard!
<user0> Congratulations! That's brilliant news
<user1> I agree. I'm jumping with happiness right now. I cant wait to be a dad.
<user1> Good job! Do you feel proud of yourself?
<user0> yes very. Those longs nights I stayed up getting ready helped. 
<user1> Hard work always pays off! Keep it up.
<user0> I agree. This is a lesson learned in life to always be ready for whats coming up. 
<user0> What did you do?
<user1> Well I went out with old college buds and got trashed and slept with another woman. 
<user0> Man! That's pretty bad.
<user1> Yeah I could not look her in her face to tell her. 
<user1> i hope it goes well for her
<user0> we hope so too
<user1> good luck!
<user1> Awesome! Glad that you did well on the exam!
<user0> I agree. I was soooo not expecting that. im still boggled by it, but it made my day. 
<user1> Now you can celebrate this exam result! Always feels good to accomplish something like this.
<user0> Yes I agree. Even now I cant beleive I made an A!
<user0> oh wow. that is some scary stuff!! what happend?
<user1> It was about 3am. He was kicking our front door repeatedly.  My kids and wife were terrified as we waited for the cops to come.
<user0> did they catch the person?
<user1> They found him down the block, kicking at another house's door.  He was arrested, I believe.
<user1> You shouldn't like to your mom. I think you should tell her the truth about what really happened.
<user0> yah, i will tell her when she comes back from work
<user1> That sounds like a great idea!
<user1> Oh no! You have to have a tough mentality when you do that as it can be rough to have people see you fail
<user0> Yeah it was bad but i kept practicing and eventually learned pretty quick
<user1> That's good! Practice makes perfect and if everyone stopped when they failed, we would not have as much as we do today
<user1> That's terrible. Did you let others know that you had completed the job?
<user0> I talked to my boss and get it all straightened out, but it was still a really crazy situation.
<user1> I could imagine. Some people stoop low to take credit for what others do.
<user1> what kind of surgery was it?
<user0> I had knee surgery so my normal household chores is hard to keep up but she kept her word and she has helped 2 a week since she is so true to her word I have a great friend.
<user1> Thats awesome! Its great to have friends their for someone.
<user1> Oh no! Did you scold him?
<user0> No she got me with those eyes but I was very irate with her for a few days and she knew it.
<user1> I'd be angry too, but it's hard to get mad at doggos.
<user0> It is they are loving she didn't mean to I bet lol.
<user0> Congrats to you!  What kind of nurse are you looking to be?
<user1> I will be a RN I think I am over thinking the new role but I am self assured I will do great this is my passion.
<user0> I have no doubt that you will be a great RN!
<user0> That is awesome, what is his secret?
<user1> He worked 2 jobs and prior to starting he saved money I'm very influenced by his method I'm going to give it a try so I can be debt free as well.
<user0> Being debt free can be a great feeling
<user0> Im sorry to hear that. Does she have a job now?
<user1> At the time it happened, my boss found out about it and gave me more hours to make up for our loss of income till she got another job.
<user0> Well that was nice of your boss. Its great to have good people in this world
<user0> Are you excited for it?
<user1> I am very excited for it.  Im ready to start this next chapter in my life and hoping everything goes well after the move.
<user0> I hope this is the true love for you
<user0> You got this just be yourself and professional obviously and don't over think it. 
<user1> Thats my plan going into it.  It would be awesome if I got the job but if not I am happy where I am at too
<user0> You will get it happy thoughts only and if not something better is in store. 
<user0> It sounds like you are a great parent.  Does she appreciate all the help you give?
<user1> Thank you and yes she does the memories together just pleases me so much I cherish these moments.
<user0> She will definitely appreciate it when she gets older too.  I still remember my dad helping me with math homework and cant thank him enough for the help he gave me throughout the years.
<user0> Im sorry about that. How did you find out?
<user1> She came out and told me about it. It was one of the worst times in my life.
<user0> That stinks. Are you still with her or did you leave her?
<user0> Whoa that is really cool. Did you train him to do that?
<user1> I put the bell on the door so it would ring when it opened and he got used to that, so now he associates the sound with having to go out. 
<user0> That is amazing. Must be a very smart dog.
<user0> I understand! As we get older, it's hard to do it all everyday!
<user1> It is I just feel a little guilt-ridden because I told her I had an emergency instead of telling her the truth because she would have tried to talk me into still coming out.
<user0> It happens, but definitely be honest as you would want someone to be honest with you
<user0> Oh no, are you able to afford the repair for it?
<user1> Well, a friend of mine let me borrow his car for a entire month while mine was repaired. He just tossed me the keys and said bring it back when your done.
<user0> What a great friend you have. Definitly get him a gift when you are done.
<user0> I hope you can too. How is it going?
<user1> I'm about half way there. I want to save enough to rent a cottage on one of the lakes up there so I still have a ways to go.
<user0> That's great! I have faith that you can do it.
<user1> Thank you. I hope i reach my goal.
<user1> That's really good! Do you think you're ever going to use the card again?
<user0> Im hoping I wont have to.  Unless something major comes up I'm not planning on putting anything on credit again.
<user1> That is wise. I too am trying to pay off my credit card debts. After that, I'm cutting them up.
<user1> That would have really scared me.
<user0> It did scare me.  I let out a scream.  One of my friends went to school for wildlife.  He captured the bat and let it outside which was great.
<user1> I bet you are thankful that your friend was there.
<user1> All of it??? Oh no. How bad do you feel right now?
<user0> Uhm, I feel awesome in my tummy, but bad in my heart LOL
<user1> Haha I bet. Im sure they were looking forward to it.
<user1> ewww.
<user0> It was gross.  All of a sudden you would smell something and then notice the bag sitting there.
<user1> Why would it be in the house to begin with? does the dog poop in the house?
<user1> You are having trouble with family ?
<user0> My family isn't close, it's depressing.
<user1> Mine isn't either. Are you married?
<user1> Awesome! What are you going to see?
<user0> Not sure yet, I'll have to ask my friends
<user1> Whatever it is, I hope you have a good time!
<user1> Oh no!  How'd you do that?
<user0> I fell off a roof!
<user1> What were you doing on the roof?
<user1> Did you catch anything?
<user0> No!  And I was so confident that we would!
<user1> Did you at least have fun?
<user0> We did!  And some of the research work that we did let us experiment more than normal.
<user0> congrats! you must be proud!
<user1> I am, thanky ou!
<user0> My daughter is only in eigth grade we have a while to go
<user0> That is good to feel that way. You don't want to feel like someone close to you would let you down. Did it work out for you?
<user1> No, he totally bailed on me, as usual.
<user0> Oh I am sorry. That is sad. Remember that it is not your fault. I would think of the people who have been there for you. 
<user0> Oh gosh, you also scared of bugs?? That's my worst fear
<user1> Yes! I can't imagine them crawling on me when I sleep :/
<user0> I would have a heart attack! 
<user0> I have no idea what those are!
<user1> They are ukrainian pasta, kind of like stuffed pasta.
<user0> oh ok. I like ravioli is it like that?
<user0> What are pierogies? a type of food?
<user1> They are Ukrainian dumplings.
<user0> Ah nice, I love dumplings, what are in them?
<user0> That's no good, did you throw it out?
<user1> Yes, but not before I drank some. :/
<user0> Hope you don't get sick!  That would be a bad start to the weekend.
<user0> Oh, I am so sorry. It has to be the most difficult thing to have to do. I had to do that with my gorgeous lab - I still miss him!
<user1> I'm sorry to hear about your lab as well. They are very sweet dogs.
<user0> Indeed they are. And so are many cats - the farm I used to live on has a ginger tom. He's quite the character and used to visit me regularly!
<user1> I love ginger cats! Leo was a ginger, and I have one right now named Chunk.
<user0> This fella is called Oliver. He's a big old softie who is ace at catching gophers. He would bring half eaten ones to my door!
<user1> Yikes! That doesn't sound pleasant, but I know they do that to try to show you they like you. They think you appreciate the gifts.
<user0> Oh, I shouldn't be ungrateful, lol! At least he kills them before delivering them. A friends cat used to deliver live mice into the bathtub!
<user0> Did you get a promotion?
<user1> Not yet but I did get a raise!  If the company takes over I will get to be in charge of the helpdesk though!
<user0> Wow, great job!
<user1> Thank you! It's insane up here sometimes but I feel like I could be a good team lead.
<user1> Oh no!  What has you scared?
<user0> It's all new to me, I've never done it before
<user1> It'll be okay I promise.  First few days will be weird but you'll slip in no problem once you adjust to your schedule.
<user1> oh dang thats so horrible
<user0> Thank you :(
<user1> it gets better with time but it must be hard
<user1> I remember that store! I loved going shopping there, was it your first job?
<user0> It wasn't my first but it was my most favorite retail job I had
<user1> Yeah, I bet, it looked like a fun place to work.  Especially for a college job.
<user0> It really was.  It was so  laid back and chill.  I also made a ton of great friends there.
<user0> Are you having any specific problem areas?
<user1> Not yet, but I haven't started yhet
<user0> Okay. I hope you do well too.
<user0> Interesting, those things are huge, Do they even make them any more?
<user1> They haven't made them for quite a few years.  But I met a guy that just picked one up in the last few days!
<user0> Do you have a large family, or do you just like the idea of a large SUV?
<user1> We don't have a huge family, just 5.  But my wife does daycare, and our current vehicle only has 5 seats, so she's stuck at home fairly frequently.
<user0> 5 is fairly large i would say. I hope you get your giant car one day.
<user1> Thanks!  If not, we'll still manage just fine.  It would be nice, though.
<user1> It is a big change. What is scaring you?
<user0> I don't like bugs!
<user1> I hate bugs too. You should exterminate before you move in
<user1> Is it really far?
<user0> Yes, another country
<user1> oh no. im sorry to hear that
<user1> Well, that would be terrifying! Were you afraid that a vampire was there?
<user0> Hahahaha, that piece hadnt crossed my mind although it should have with all the vampire movies I had seen!  I let out a scream and one of my friends captured the bat and let it outside to be free.
<user1> Well, that would be very creepy! They would hear my scream in the next town over!
<user1> You were ready? That's good to hear.
<user0> Yes and we made $1026.25!
<user1> Aweomse.  Treat yo self.gif
<user1> Are you prepared?
<user0> I am prepared for it.  I'll be a lot happier once it is over.
<user1> I bet. Good luck to you
<user1> Where you supposed to be there? If so, then that is a nice feeling.
<user0> Yeah, everyone else was just gone.  It was nice for a while, but got a bit lonely.
<user1> Oh I see. That could make the time go slow also. 
<user0> It did toward the end of the day for sure!
<user0> That's great. What classes are you taking?
<user1> I'm a computer science student. The one I'm most excited about is Microprocessors.
<user0> That's pretty cool... Are you going to go towards hardware or stick with programming?
<user1> I want to be a software developer I think, so I like the programming.
<user0> You should go all out and get a EE degree to go with it.  You can do microprocessor design.
<user1> I really like school, so you never know what I might decide to go for next. Thank you for the advice.
<user0> Any time. Have a good weekend :D
<user0> Did that happen tonight?
<user1> No, it was a few years ago.
<user0> Well, it must've been something you said.
<user0> Did she have a party?
<user1> We're actually having it this coming weekend.
<user0> Does she have her license yet?
<user1> No . . . that's a long story involving her idiot father.  I'm somewhat glad, though, as she can't seem to set her phone down.
<user0> Well, there's no hurry in driving, is there? What does she do mostly on her phone? Text??
<user1> Text, video chat, watch some goofball put makeup on, and shop.  Things most teenagers do, I suppose.
<user0> Does she play any sports?
<user0> That's super frustrating! I've only ever had outside pets so I can't really offer advice, but it's one of those things where your anger is all misplaced because you know you can't really be upset with the dog since it doesn't know any better.
<user1> I do understand that part too.  I actually got a puppy a couple months before her so I went through this all.  I just wish her puppy listened as well as mine because he took a couple months as has been doing great since.  I know it'll click eventually...I just wish shed hurry up :)
<user0> It'll be well worth it when she gets the hang of it, but urgh. Bathroom problems are why I don't think I want a kid anytime soon!
<user0> You got a present? How lovely! What was the occasion?
<user1> It was my anniversary.
<user0> Well, happy anniversary! What was your present?
<user0> I agree.. Did something happen?
<user1> No, just frustrated
<user0> I'm sorry.. Not everyone is bad.  Just a lot of people.
<user0> That was nice
<user1> Yes, I love my mom and I will give her something even better for her birthday!
<user0> Do you have anything in mind?
<user0> So, I take you left to live someplace else?
<user1> Haha yes, I ended up saving up then moving out and buying my own place.  I wont miss the flies sitting around the kitchen and he's still just as messy...now its on his own though instead of with other people.
<user0> Just remember to never invite you ex-roomate to your new place, EVER!!!!!!
<user0> Very nice, congrats on making it that far. I actually was in the same situation about a week ago.  How do you feel you match up to the others?
<user1> I had much more experience than both of them, but ended up not getting the job. I am still pretty upset about it.
<user0> I would be upset too.  However, I wouldnt get discouraged though.  There may be another opportunity even better that comes along soon.
<user0> That's great, it's good to see people finish what they start. You must be very proud.
<user1> I was.  I know how hard it was for him so it was great seeing that hard work pay off in the long run.
<user0> Well, hopefully there will be nothing but great things for him in his future.
<user0> I am so glad to hear that.  Did he find a job?
<user1> He did!  He actually just started a new job that he loves and is related to his degree.
<user0> That is good to hear.  What will he be doing?
<user0> Oh that's wonderful! How long have you two been dating?
<user1> We have been dating almost a year.  I'm just excited to take this next step in the relationship.
<user0> It's a huge step, congratulations! 
<user0> Sometimes deaths affect us even when we're not really close.
<user1> Thats very true.  I know she feels bad for not keeping as close contact as she could have with her aunt now.
<user0> Guilt can be a terrible thing to live with.
<user0> Is he sick or just being lazy?
<user1> A little bit of both.  He has bad anxiety but he also has told me he just doesnt like going into work.
<user0> I hope he can get the help he needs and maybe a job he enjoys more.
<user0> Oh, well that's awful on a little person! I never liked it when a teacher did that when a child needed to go to the bathroom!
<user1> Thanks! Luckily I am potty trained now!
<user0> LOL, well, that's good to know. So am I!
<user0> Is your patient improving an following good medical advice?
<user1> Yes. After 3 years of working with her she finally started to take her medication as prescribed as well as watch her carb and sugar intake. I checked her blood sugar today and to my suprise it was normal!
<user0> That would be a surprise.  A lot of people are not dedicated enough to change their condition, especially those with diabetes.
<user1> I agree!. I was so proud of her and her test results surprised me! 
<user1> Thats... uh... strange?
<user0> It was embarrassing but I think that she stayed with me is after is a good sign!
<user1> I think so, you're two peas in a pod.
<user1> Pets are great, but they can be a bit needy for attention at times. It is great, but not when you are busy and trying to get things done.
<user0> Thats very true.  After our first conversation I might have to take a break and play with him a bit.  I might have to log off and go on a sort walk to tire him out.
<user1> A walk will definitely help. He will probably be ready for a nap when you get back, then you can get some work done.
<user1> Oh my god! That's terrible!
<user0> Then I woke up, it was all a dream.
<user1> Oh that's so great!
<user1> That's amazing!  Congratulations!  Swimming can be tough
<user0> Thank you! He takes to it like a fish in water. HaHA!
<user1> LOL I bet you use that line all the time!  I love it
<user1> Oh man! I hope no one noticed. 
<user0> Unfortunately I kept getting looks! It's alright though!
<user1> I'm glad that it all worked out!
<user1> Oh, I bet you are really torn.
<user0> I am, I would think I'll be done pretty soon and then take him for a nice long walk.
<user1> I'm sure he will love that. I bet you will see the joy just shining in his eyes.
<user1> That's one of the hardest parts of life. What happened??
<user0> We drifted apart it seems
<user1> That is hard! Relationships are hard work.
<user1> That is great of them, did you do anything to pay them back?
<user0> I took him out to dinner later on, he's a good friend
<user1> That is nice of you, glad you have supportive friends!
<user1> Aw poor mouse. I have had a few before..We actually rescued a few from our cat :/ 
<user0> I hope I can catch it at some point
<user1> They have live traps to catch and release that are only a couple bucks. Mice really are sweet natured.
<user1> What happened to them?
<user0> I eventually got them, but it almost cost me this project I've been working on
<user1> Good, sorry you were inconvenienced, hope things get more consistent!
<user1> that sounds like fun. for some reason kids really enjoy cooking.
<user0> Yeah, he seemed to have a good time.  We made cheese too which was a first for both of us.  It turned out pretty good too which was nice.
<user1> that sounds like fun. i want to try to make mozzerella
<user1> Did you study for it at least?
<user0> I did but it is a law school exam. You just never know.
<user1> That is true, well best of luck to you friend!
<user1> That is bad. What did you do after that?
<user0> I went to the bathroom to clean up, it was a new shirt as well
<user1> Did he say sorry?
<user1> What show was it?
<user0> Black Mirror
<user1> is that the one with Bryce Dallas Howard?
<user1> Oh? What about them?
<user0> Just how fun and carefree they were.
<user1> That's true. Any memory in particular?
<user1> Is it really? How hot is it there?
<user0> The hottest it got was 99 degrees. It has been in the mid 80s mostly, but I was expecting cooler weather in New England.
<user1> That is hot, but it is a bit hotter where I live here
<user0> I don't like it at all, but I can put up with it until fall.
<user0> Did you feel lonely, or were you happy to have some time to yourelf?
<user1> A bit sad. More bored than anything.
<user0> That is tough when you're not used to being alone.  What did you end up doing?
<user0> Oh that's cool!  What do you all have planned?
<user1> Probably go hiking and visit some local towns
<user0> Well that sounds like a fun little trip.
<user0> thats nice to be able to relax
<user1> Have you had a good day?  Hopefully you dont have a busy weekend and can relax a little bit.
<user0> everyday is a good day!
<user0> Really? You must really like you job then
<user1> Yeah, I think I have all my work materials set
<user0> Good for you! I hope you  have good week!
<user0> Awesome! I am happy for you!
<user1> Thanks! Regardless I am a bit nervous. There are a lot of things to remember and I don't want to look like a fool on the job.
<user0> I am sure you will do fine! Good Luck!
<user0> Oh I am so sorry. Best thing to do is be there for her.
<user1> Thank you for your sympathies. Have you ever dealt with losing a pet?
<user0> I have and it really hard. It just takes time But a good support system makes it way better.
<user1> I'm happy to hear you were able to get through it over time.
<user1> how did she handle it
<user0> Well, I sent her some pizza and it was so unexpected it turned her whole day around!
<user1> well that was nice of you
<user1> did it help?
<user0> Definitely. I aced it, and now I'm officially in a trial period!
<user1> congrats! i hope it works out
<user1> That was good of you.  He didn't hurt her did he?
<user0> No, but he was just being mean. So mean he decided to kick me out of the house.
<user1> Oh no!!! Where did you end up going?
<user0> To my girlfriend's place. Luckily it only lasted a week, and my Mom is super caring and loving. She took me back in against his wishes.
<user1> That was so awesome of your mom :)
<user1> Why did they do that?
<user0> For no good reason; there are evil people in this world. I was so scared I cried on the way back home.
<user1> That is terrible. Those days, a lot of people do stupid things.
<user1> Children usually do really well, they are versatile. 
<user0> I have heard that, but now I truly believe that!
<user1> I hope he continues to do well.
<user1> Are you excited or will it be lonely? 
<user0> In between I am very positive that she will be ok but just the thought of your first born going into the real world away from you is scary a little but I know she will be just fine. 
<user1> Yeah that is scary. I am sure she will do great things though!
<user1> I bet it was really quiet and lonely. Did you find some time for yourself though?
<user0> A little to quite and I was very lonely I'm glad it's over lol I started isolating my self to much when they was away. 
<user1> I don't think I would like that quiet either.
<user1> Well that's not good. I'm sorry to hear that. Do you think maybe you were just too nervous during the test?
<user0> The test and the whole semester I just didn't give it my all like I should have and now I feel really crappy and regretful I need to redo course and give it my all.
<user1> Never be too confident! You've got to give life your all at every step.
<user1> I agree. I dont know why they work in the service industry if they don't like to be nice
<user0> Exactly what is even worse is the managers who are just as rude, I get so upset I had this happen to me at Wendy's staff was so unprofessional. 
<user1> Fast food employees are the worst sometimes... it's like we bother them
<user1> How exciting!!!  I bet you are thinking already about  how you want to decorate it and fix up the lawn, etc..
<user0> I am this is all I ever wanted for my family and it is about to come I am so thrilled with joy can't wait. 
<user1> I can imagine!  It is certainly an exciting time.  I bet you are just over the moon happy!
<user1> Any experience with what?
<user0> Anything that made you happy
<user1> Yes some things
<user0> can you share anything
<user0> Are you trying to save money by not eating out at work?
<user1> Yup, and I am too lazy to drive out to a restaurant!
<user0> Well, it can save you a bunch of money!  Plus you gain the time that you would normally spend going out somewhere and you can use that time to have more of a break.
<user0> Oh my! I bet you was so disgusted that you ran out of there. 
<user1> Yup the smell was disgusting!
<user0> Yikes! Why in the world would somebody do that?
<user0> Whoa! That is really scary! I've felt weird sensations like that before.
<user1> Yeah. Unfortunately, it was a monster! I am just ugly!
<user0> No! I'm sure you are not as monster-ish as you think!
<user0> Aw that's nnice of her
<user1> Yup! She worked hard for like 3 weeks to save up for it! I love her!
<user0> Moms are the best
<user0> Did you kill the snake?
<user1> Nope! I packed up and went straight home!
<user0> That is too bad, will you ever camp again?
<user0> Did they do a good job?
<user1> Surprisingly they he did, I guess sometimes we I need to trust people.
<user0> Did you take them out for drinks after the meeting?
<user0> sounds awesome
<user1> Yes, it was a tasty lunch.
<user0> i would have loved to do the same
<user0> Did you resolve things?
<user1> Yes eventually, but I am sorry to admit that I said things I should have never said to him out of anger.
<user0> I hope you can get over that pain.
<user1> Thanks, me too.  I should have remained calm and not called him names and say things I didnt mean.
<user1> That's awesome! It would be amazing to win a million one day. One can dream.
<user0> Yup, I am going to buy another one just because of you! I hope I win!
<user1> That's great. I hope you do! Maybe this time you can get $40. But gamble only in moderation!
<user1> That is really upsetting!
<user0> It was. I just wanted some quality family time.
<user1> Well forget them! If they don't care about you you don't need to care about them
<user1> for fun?
<user0> Yeah. We called it the box game and walked around inside of a refrigerator box for protection.
<user1> well that sounds pretty fun!
<user1> Were you satisfied with the results?
<user0> I was! 95%
<user1> Excellent!
<user1> how did it go
<user0> Not good. I was very drunk though
<user1> oh well maybe next time
<user1> how many days has it been?
<user0> 2 years
<user1> wow thats great!
<user1> Drunk people can get pretty disgusting in general.
<user0> For sure. it was not a pretty sight.
<user1> Some people can't hold their liquor.
<user1> I can imagine. What happend that you got your jaw wired?
<user0> I got punched while drunk without a mouth guard years ago - still think about it !
<user1> Man that sounds aweful.
<user1> Nice.  Always feels good to be at the top knowing nothing can't touch you
<user0> Right just staying active, don't need much money, minimal drama. Easy
<user1> Absolutely
<user1> I feel like everyone goes through that phase.  I know I did too
<user0> I've noticed that it's easier to be happy while not around someone all the time.
<user1> Would you say you're more of an introvert?
<user1> Especially in the south
<user0> Right. I live as north as you're gonna get in the US and it still sucks.
<user1> Oh wow, that does sound horrible
<user1> did you find out the results?
<user0> Yeah I crushed
<user1> dang thats awesome!
<user1> Oh wow and you couldn't keep your job? What were you going to school for?
<user0> I still work there, but just part time now. I am studying Computer Science.
<user1> Oh wonderful! One of the best fields to be in right now
<user0> I love it. Just ten more classes to go until I finish.
<user1> Wow! Good luck, there are so many things you can do with that degree and from home too!
<user0> Thank you! I hope to work from home.
<user0> That is awesome. I never even get a second date A husband may not be in the cards lol
<user1> lol you just haven't came across the right person yet. It is incredible I arranged and had them a surprise dinner party it turned out very nice.
<user0> Thats sweet. I bet they enjoyed it
<user0> I hate bad traffic, did you get in an accident?
<user1> Due to a reckless driver running the red light, but most wrecks I have witnessed come from careless drivers or drivers driving slow in the fast lane and get tail ended I get so irritated I swear. 
<user0> That's the worst, I hate when people are careless.
<user0> I know what you mean
<user1> My coworker did this recent we was suppose to have lunch she didn't call or anything. 
<user0> that sucks. have you talked to her?
<user1> Seen her at work but she has been avoiding me even more rude but never again will I plan an outing with her. 
<user1> That is awful.  I agree.  A professional setting is supposed to be ... well, professional.  What steps are being taken to correct that?
<user0> We have a team building coming up and let's hope this works which I predict it will be some type of good outcome. 
<user1> I agree.  I hope it will be.  Team building, communication, and professionalism will all help a company.  I think this is why so many companies fail.  
<user1> Wow, you do really live far from your parents. Do you go to college or work?
<user0> I work. We moved far from where they grew up when I was young, and they ended up moving back for retirement. 
<user1> I see. Well, it seems as people get older they want to go back to places which reminds them of past. Nostalgia probably helps them cope with passing life
<user1> I can see how that would be a downer.  Will you still get to see them?
<user0> Once in a while, here and there.
<user1> At least they aren't gone completely, but I can understand how that would affect your day to day work life.
<user1> i would be really annoyed myself, why so many frequent calls ?
<user0> I'm not sure. This is my first time shopping for a mortgage, so I'm not sure if it's normal or not.
<user1> i know ever since i purchased a new car, i know for a fact i did not read the fine print but insurance companys call me almost every day multiple times a day , its really annoying 
<user1> I know right! my parents love tennis, so I grw up watching it.
<user0> I had played a little bit growing up, but never watched it professionally. 
<user1> were you ever any good at it?
<user1> Good for you to have such memorable experience to have and remember of. Can you bake now for real?
<user0> Yes somewhat, although with all that practice in childhood I should be much better.   I miss my stepdad so much.   I have nothing but fond memories of him.
<user1> Are you still in contact with him?
<user1> Oh that sucks. I hate when that happens.
<user0> Yeah, it'll be okay though. There's always something else that will come available.
<user1> I bet the next house you look at will be amazing and even better than that one.
<user1> That sounds exhausting! Were you driving for work or just taking a vacation?
<user0> Vacation. Went to go visit my parents.
<user1> I'm sure the drives worth it since you get to spend time with the family.
<user1> Was he alone?
<user0> Yes, I was very excited to see him.
<user1> Cool. Did you do something special?
<user1> Congrats
<user0> Thank you!
<user1> Do you get a raise?
<user1> Probably they noticed some irregular or even fraudulent activities associated with your account
<user0> No, I prequalified for a mortgage, and they've been wanting me to speak to a loan specialist ever since.
<user1> Are you interested in mortgage for now?
<user1> Oh that is really gross! Have you talked to her about it?
<user0> No, I don't feel like it's my place to tell her what to do.
<user1> If you share the fridge, I'd let her know if it causes an odor or might affect the other food.
<user1> cool. did he have gifts?
<user0> No, but I'm not big on gifts.
<user1> Oh. I am lol
<user1> Like what? Bad or miserable?
<user0> sad, when you see beggar in the street
<user1> Yes indeed. Seeing people less fortunate than me makes go to pieces
<user0> What do you think when you see them
<user0> Wow. enjoy your own time.
<user1> I will, it is going to be great to get away together.
<user0> Yeah, you're right. Hope you've memorable vacation.
<user0> Wao,thats really not cool
<user1> NO, not cool at all.  We ended up breaking up for a bit and he didnt waste any time before seeing this girl.   I wasted four years of my life for that to happen.   
<user0> He doesnt deserve you,so wipe your tears
<user0> That's sad. But I'm sure they stil want to be firends with you too
<user1> I dont think they do.  He was an abusive guy and he didnt want me to have them as friends and he would make up lies about me .  I dont think it was so much the lies he made up because they knew they were not true.  I think they were just loyal to him.
<user0> Posibly. Sounds like you are better off without him though
<user0> That's awesome, I wish I could build my own house.
<user1> Is the conversation over? You are welcome then.
<user0> Well thank you as well.
<user0> Did she die recently?
<user1> No she had to go to the humane society when my ex boyfriend and I broke up.   I had no choice, and he did it just to hurt me.  Lily would go swimming with me, ride on our boat etc.  When she was just a pup she would sit on my lap as i rode the four wheeler. 
<user0> Oh wow! Thats so sad, I know animals can be like kids to use. I'm so sorry
<user0> That can ruin a persons life.
<user1> I know it can which is why I was so worried at court.  THe judge looked at him and said son you need to hire you a lawyer.  I  throw people in jail for things like this.
<user0> That is such a mess.
<user0> Tell me more, sounds exciting! 
<user1> Well we have these weekly meetings about our goals and today I was recognized by name in front of everyone for a job well done.
<user0> Good on you! You finally got recognition for your hard work
<user0> Oh no what happened?
<user1> I was going to go to a concert but couldn't get myself to go by myself at the last minute. I feel like I'm going to regret not going.
<user0> What concert was it?
<user1> It was an annual block party we have here with a local lineup of musicians. I really liked the lineup!
<user0> That probably would have been fun.
<user0> That sounds terrible. I hope you're okay now.
<user1> I am doing better now but it was really hard times.  We had moved everything up higher as we never expected our whole house to go.  Unfortunately we had all our belongings in the house as well.
<user0> Well all the matters is that no one was hurt. You can buy property again but not lives.
<user0> That is so messed up!
<user1> Yeah, I was pretty upset, especially when they initially refuse to refund my money.
<user0> I would be so angry.
<user0> Oh wow, What kind of dog was it? I'm so sorry that must've been super hard
<user1> He was a lab.  It broke my heart, to be honest.
<user0> I can imagine. I haven't had an animal die yet but my cat is 13 and I'm dreading the day
<user0> That's wonderful that you are pursuing a degree. What is it in?
<user1> I am getting a counseling degree to help abused women.  I feel I would make a good counselor since I  have been in a few abusive relationships myself.
<user0> That is great that you have been able to overcome and do this to help others. You can really make a difference! 
<user0> Yeah? Which game was it for?
<user1> The new Spyro Remastered game coming out. Seeing it really reminded me of how I used to play the original all day with an old friend of mine.
<user0> Nice. The original Spyro is a classic.
<user0> Oh no. What did you do?
<user1> I used a screwdriver to work the jack. It sucked, lol.
<user0> Lol, well done for attempting it. Did you make it to work on time?
<user1> Yep, with 5 minutes to spare. (No pun intended)
<user1> That's great. What made it so special this year?
<user0> I usually don't do much to celebrate but this year a friend of mine got all my other friends together to throw a party for me without me knowing. It was a great time.
<user1> Sounds like fun! I'm glad you had a happy birthday.
<user1> I am so happy for you! Congrats!
<user0> Thank you!  We were both pretty shocked by the news, lol.
<user1> I wish you nothing but the best!
<user1> It sounds like you're talking about two different people there instead of just one person.  I'm a little confused.
<user0> Oh my I am getting ahead of myself.  I was referring to when I had to put my daughter emerson up for adoption in 2011.  
<user1> Ouch that sucks. I'm sorry to hear that.
<user1> Why what happened? Are y'all on a trip?
<user0> We made plans to catch up but never set a time. I tried to contact him to figure out what time and he never got back to me. I was looking forward to catching up.
<user1> Oh wow, so he basically ghosted you? I would be mad too
<user1> That sounds very bizarre.
<user0> Serious, that has being my worse situation so far
<user1> I hope you are okay.
<user1> That is so messed up!
<user0> Yeah it is! Im going to have to spend money I didnt have. Im so upset right now.
<user1> I hope this doesn't happen again.
<user0> I agree. I have never felt this frusterated in a long time! I should go for a walk
<user0> Oh my, what did you do, may I ask?
<user1> I was playing a board game with a few friends and I ended up spilling my entire drink all over the table. 
<user0> That does not sound good. It must have been so embarrassing!
<user0> Oh no, what happened?
<user1> I had to explain how a bunch of things work in front of a lot of people. I'm not a fan of talking in front of a crowd.
<user0> I hate public speaking too!
<user0> Dallas is a really fast city.
<user1> yeah it is. I dont know anybody and my classmates all have jobs. so I get to be at home by myself alot
<user0> I'm sorry, things will get better.
<user1> thank you. i wish i havd more friends here. 
<user1> What are your plans?
<user0> A friend of mine has been out of the country for a year and he has finally come back. We're going to catch up.
<user1> Thats aweosme! Is he going to be staying with you?
<user0> Yep, we have all weekend to hangout!
<user0> That is terrible. What happened then?
<user1> Well not much. Its just I feel bad because I told her I would take her but got so busy. Maybe im the one that should have got the ticket. not her
<user0> I understand. My mistaske always happened.
<user1> I agree. Its my fault she will have this fine. I will have to pay it for her now . 
<user1> Those are so stressful. Just take it step by step and you can get on track. 
<user0> You really have to. Luckily, my family was able to help me out and get me back on my feet. It's definitely nice to have people who are willing to help.
<user1> That makes all the difference. I am glad you were able to get out of that position. 
<user1> You must be really excited for it! Do you think its going to be girl or boy?
<user0> we all want a boy so we are all cant wait to find out what it is. everyone is so impatient about it, but today is the day.
<user1> Well, it will great either way as long as the baby is healthy! 
<user0> I agree!. I cant wait to get there to find out. lol
<user0> Do you plan do something this weekend?
<user1> Quite the opposite, really. I just paid all my bills and have not really any plans. Sometimes it's nice to just not have that stress and relax.
<user0> Yes. It is sometime nice to just rest at home.
<user0> That sounds like fun Do you know who haunts it?
<user1> I dont know, but I feel I should not go, but again I promised my friend I would go. I dont know wha to do now. 
<user0> Well, if you promised I would try to go. I'm sure it'll be fine. 
<user1> I agree. I will think about it for now. I'm very scared something will happen so im debating. 
<user1> Nice! You must be pretty confident she will say yes.
<user0> Yes I agree. I feel that way about it. You know me too well. 
<user1> I hope it goes well for you and brings happiness to you both.
<user0> Thank you. I hope she dont say no, but i can bet you she says yes. 
<user0> That sounds terrible. But hopefully it isnt suffering any more. 
<user1> She had stomach cancer, so she was in a lot of pain. Definitely the right thing to do
<user0> I agree, just remember her for all the good memories. 
<user0> Have you been studying? That is intimidating but I bet you'll do great! What's the subject?
<user1> It's for a PC Architecture class. I'm feeling really good about it though since I studied really hard all week!
<user0> What an interesting course! I hope you do really well. Exams can be so scary- they can cause such anxiety. 
<user0> That is very bad. Did you complaint to the landlord?
<user1> They don't care. They live upstairs and are very dirty people. I'm moving as soon as I get a job!
<user0> I understand. The best thing is to move.
<user0> That's awful! I'm always scared that's going to happen to me when it's raining
<user1> I agree and thank god I was the only car on the freeway , otherwise It would be a different story!
<user0> You got lucky for sure!  I can't imagine how scary that would be
<user1> Yah im very thankful to be here right now! whew!
<user1> Really, where was this parade at? I'm in Missouri and it was absolutely pouring on Friday
<user0> I'm here down south and It has been pouring as well, but that didnt stop people from coming! Im shocked. 
<user1> I usually don't let a little rain stop me unless it's ridiculous!
<user0> I agree! They even brougth their kids! its so baffling!
<user0> oh no. feeling empathy towards them just shows you're normal. There's a lot of people in your boat
<user1> Yea. It reminds me of my old dog that was a rescue. So many memories. I want to go get one actually. 
<user0> whats preventing you?
<user1> I started nursing school and work full time, so I wont give much time to it. I want it to be a happy dog. 
<user0> you sound too kind. You'd be a great dog mother/father!
<user1> Thank you! Im gonna have to not see them commercials anymore, otherwise I will cry 
<user1> That sounds fun!  What are they exactly?
<user0> Almost any game that has an online component! Like right now I play The Secret World and it has mystery boxes.
<user1> It sounds like you really enjoy it!  Good for you!
<user1> How exciting! She must be thrilled too
<user0> Yes she is. We are all so excited to finally hang out! We have so much planned
<user1> I hope you guys have the best time!
<user0> Thank you! WE will make the best of it !
<user0> That unfortunate.  Are you feeling a little jealous?
<user1> I guess you can say that! What a day!
<user0> I hate it when stuff like that happens. 
<user1> I agree. Maybe I will act like him next time. 
<user0> Haha, nooooo... don't do that.   There are too many of those people in the world as it is.
<user1> Yeah your right. I will stick to my little envious rant and go about my day
<user0> Sounds like the best course to me :)
<user0> That sounds so great. Being in nature makes you feel so good. 
<user1> It does! I really hope we get to go camping again this fall.
<user0> You should just make a plan and do it. It sounds like it is worthwhile. 
<user0> That sucks, sorry to hear that. Did you get a refund?
<user1> We didn't get a refund but they were able to fix the order. I was really craving Chinese!
<user0> Hopefully they get your order correct the next time you order there!
<user0> Did it taste good?
<user1> It was really good! She had a lot of candy. I was hoping she wouldn't notice some missing!
<user0> Did it taste good?
<user1> Yes it did!
<user1> Were you suprised that they did this for you?
<user0> yes and i am quiet happy that they also brought my wife who stays in london for party to surprise me
<user1> Wow! How happy you must be. I be that day brought you lost of excitement. 
<user0> yes it took me with a surprise how well my colleagues planned for me
<user1> You must have great co workers. I bet your happy everyday you go to work
<user1> oh so sad , what happened to it
<user0> He died of old age. He could barely walk so they put him down. Yeah pretty bad news. It made my day blue
<user1> it must must a very much hard time for you and your family 
<user0> Yes it is. He is in a better place now. 
<user1> yes , he be rest in peace
<user1> I would be so scared. I think I might have to leave. Did the bears bother anyone?
<user0> Luckily, the hunters kept them around a mile from camp. It was still very hard to sleep! We heard dogs barking at the bears all night!
<user1> Were you in a tent or a camper? I hope you kept your food locked up tightly.
<user0> We were in a tent and all of food was in a Yeti! I made sure everyone put their food away and burned leftovers in the fire.
<user1> Glad everyone is safe! You were very smart.
<user1> Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. I know pets can be like one of the family. 
<user0> They are like having another child! I hope to have another doberman one day. They're really good dogs.
<user1> You should adopt a rescue dog. That would be great for the family. 
<user0> That's a great idea!
<user0> That's disgusting. What did you do about it?
<user1> i immediately raised an alarm about the issue and complained to store manager
<user0> Did you get a refund at least? I would never visit that restaurant ever again if I were you!
<user1> yes they provided me a 100 dollar gift card too
<user1> That's interesting! Most kids love being home-schooled but I guess she missed socializing and interacting with her peers.
<user0> She did miss having a lot of friends. I hope she does well. She starts in 10 days!
<user1> Not too much longer! I hope she adjusts well and enjoys herself. Public school can still provide an enriching experience when it comes to social skills and education.
<user1> Wow good job! SO close
<user0> THanks!. I get so happy everytime I think about it!
<user1> Thats a great accomplishment
<user0> I agree. My family will be proud of me! 
<user0> maybe you should job a club or a social gatherings group
<user1> I agree. It gets boring at home alone with no one. 
<user0> i agree. you need to socialize a little bit to get out of your lonely slump
<user1> I agree. This weekend it is! 
<user0> that should be fun. good luck!
<user0> Aw that's annoying. Work always gets in the way of things. Did you ever try to go to her?
<user1> I haven't yet. I would like to eventually. I'm hoping to see her soon
<user0> I'm sure it will work out! Not this time unfortunatly, but it will in the end
<user0> Did he take care of it for you?
<user1> He did. I feel I can let him use it more often after this. 
<user0> That is great that he was able to show you he is responsible. I bet you're proud. 
<user1> Yes I am. I can know rest assure that he will do good. 
<user1> That's awesome, what does your hubster do?
<user0> He owns an auto repair shop. He works from sun up to sun down!
<user1> Wow, I admire his dedication! And you won't ever have to worry about your vehicle breaking!
<user0> That's is the number one perk of having a mechanic for a husband!
<user0> Hard work pays off in the long-run. If your work is truly authentic in its nature, it is definitely going to be recognized and appreciated
<user1> I agree. I think my raise will be good as well as the promotion I asked for. 
<user0> Be careful while negotiating your pay raise. Some managers may find it too intrusive and that may leave bad impression on them
<user1> Sounds like a plan! She has noticed my work , so im confident it will work out well. 
<user1> Oh no, do you think she was trying to get back at you for grounding her?
<user0> I think she thought she could play a few minutes of Minecraft and then return the controller before I woke up! I caught her getting into the drawer where I hid it.
<user1> I definitely remember trying something like that when I was a kid.  I think sometimes kids think they're sneakier than they actually are.
<user1> Whow!  That sounds really disgusting!  What did you do?
<user0> Yes it was! I could not do nothing. She was in a raging fit. Ijust made she she went to sleep ok. 
<user1> Man, you are a good friend!  I would have been beyond angry!
<user0> I am! I'm more grossed out about it than anything!
<user0> So sorry to hear that. It is truly horrifying and i wish and hope for nobody to be hit with this calamity
<user1> Yeah. Shes my best friend, so I'm planning to go with her this weekend to see her mom. my heart breaks for her..
<user0> Indeed. Friends should be together in times of need. That is what friends are for
<user1> I agree! Thank you!
<user1> oh no!! Did anyone notice? it's normal though, we all do that sometimes
<user0> Yes it was loud. I can feel my face turn red and the room getting quiet!
<user1> oh man... It happened to me before, i know how embarrassing it is.
<user0> Yes it was. Ugh!
<user0> That's great that he passed though!  ARe you happy about it?
<user1> Im very happy, but all he do through school was party and never study. Im shocked. 
<user0> Well at least he passed - that's great!
<user1> Yes it is. Im happy for him.!
<user1> That is pretty neat actually. I wish i had kids to bring to stuff like that.
<user0> You should check your local library. The ones in my area have tons of things, like a Lego club, for the local kids.
<user1> I will do that, i had no idea.
<user1> I'm really sorry to hear that.
<user0> Thank you. I was prepared, but it was still difficult.
<user1> I can't even imagine to be honest.
<user0> I hope you don't have to go through it for a long time.
<user1> I have lost grandparents and greatparents but they were all older in age so it was easier to deal with.
<user0> It's always tough, even if someone is older.
<user1> I'm sure it will be different when it's a parent.
<user1> that's awesome! I hope you will get a promotion. what do you do for work?
<user0> I work as an accountant for a carpet cleaning company. There is a chance that I could be made a manager!
<user1> You will be a great manager! Good luck with everythig
<user1> you took a risk huh? i hope he will be a great worker! That's good you gave him a chance
<user0> Yes, I need more staff member and he was very nice. But if he does a bad job I get fired.
<user1> i hope it won't happen! 
<user1> Oh no! Did he say anything about it?
<user0> He laughed at me. Looking back, I'm sure it was funny but in the moment, I could have died!
<user1> I know what you mean. I've done stuff like that too - you do feel a bit silly, don't you!
<user1> Awesome! What are you planning on buying?
<user0> I've got a baby due in December so something for the baby or my wife. I never bother getting my self anything.
<user1> Maybe you can figure out a way to get all three of you guys something!
<user1> Oh no that is crazy!
<user0> Yea, We have a baby due in December so I'm trying to not jump to any decisions to quickly.
<user1> Well I'm sorry you are going through this and I hope you can figure it all out. 
<user0> Thanks, everything happens for a reason. 
<user0> I hate those things, i try to not eat those at all.
<user1> I usually love eating sandwiches which is why I knew something just wasn't right! I was experiencing morning sickness!
<user0> I eat steak and shrimp.
<user0> i really dislike snooty people who are constantly rubbing their amazing life in your face.
<user1> I do too. It makes me not want to be around those types of people.
<user0> i wouldn't be friends with someone like that. i mean what can you benefit from that friendship?
<user1> Exactly! I should really stop hanging out with him.
<user0> agreed. you really won't be missing out on anything worthwhile.
<user0> I love Taylor Swift! She's talented and beautiful!
<user1> Yes I need to arrive at her concert tonight at  8!
<user0> How exciting for you! Have fun!
<user0> You have a test coming up?
<user1> Yes on Friday. It is the final.
<user0> Well I hope you do well! Good luck.
<user0> That's interesting. What was she doing?
<user1> She had her birthday at Chuck E Cheese.
<user0> That's awesome! I didn't know that place was still in business. 
<user0> Yeah I bet it is frustrating. The store gets reimbursed for the coupons so they should not nitpick.
<user1> I agree. It's not like the money will come out of their paycheck if something is wrong!
<user0> I hope they get better training so you don't have to argue with them about it
<user0> Too old for what? What a strange thing to say.
<user1> Too old to give him a ticket for reckless driving! 
<user0> That doesn't make much sense. Maybe I am missing the context.
<user1> That's what I thought! 
<user1> Oh no, he shouldn't have gambled. 
<user0> You are probably right! I felt bad when I was spending the money. I hope he didn't really need it.
<user1> I would've too, but sometimes people need to learn a lesson.
<user0> This is very true!
<user0> Oh no! Did you property get broken into? Or your neighbor's property?
<user1> No, my neighbor did but that's close enough for me! 
<user0> For real! Are you taking any precautions?
<user0> Inside the restaurant ? What kind of place was this ?
<user1> It was outside a fried chicken chain restaurant
<user0> Okay, that makes more sense then to me.
<user0> Where are you located ?
<user1> We are in Miami, Florida 1 mile from the beach. .
<user0> I wasn't even aware there was a hurricane.
<user0> Who did what?
<user1> I wont find out who the person was that hit my car while I was sleeping.
<user0> Oh I'm so sorry to hear that. People are so inconsiderate!
<user0> Oh no! Why not?!
<user1> Not, sure, but she is not very nice at all.
<user0> I would make a complaint to the principal if I were you!
<user0> Never know who was?
<user1> The women that hit my car and left before the police came.
<user0> Wow that is aweful! 
<user1> I agree. And the cop said I will probably have to pay for my own damage! 
<user1> Oh wow, what happened?
<user0> When we pulled up, it was very spooky. I didn't even want to get out of the car! A few of my friends tried to get in but it was boarded up. I looked in the window and there was still writing on the chalkboards!
<user1> That would give me the creeps! Has anyone seen anything there?
<user0> There are stories about ghosts of children walking through the hallways and that you can hear laughing. We didn't see or hear anything supernatural but it was still scary!
<user1> I bet it was. I've only had one creepy experience - that was in an old house in West Virginia. I'm very careful to avoid those places these days!
<user1> Good for you! There is nothing wrong or uncool about short hair.
<user0> That's what I have discovered! I get a lot of compliments on it and I feel really good about myself when I go out!
<user1> Great! I'm glad that it worked out well for you!
<user1> That's awesome, I went to visit my parents and my hometown last month, it is a great feeling.  How was the fair?
<user0> It was great, it didn't change much but it still has that 'soul' to it. Just felt great looking at it honestly.
<user1> Brings back all the memories you had as a kid.  I miss going to the state fair, was always fun.
<user1> You must have been sad and angry.
<user0> I was. I would get really mad when I saw them at lunch or after school together. I was my first experience with heart break.
<user1> Yes first heart brake is so hard, I feel for you, something similar happened to me with my first boyfriend.
<user1> That's awesome! Congratulations!
<user0> Thanks! I will get to go free to the Taylor Swift concert tonight! 
<user1> No way! That's actually a super awesome prize! Have fun
<user1> Ouch, hopefully its not by much. I remember when i was in high school i had a similar situation. They're usually pretty lenient on it.
<user0> I had to take money out of my dad's wallet to cover it. I would have got in so much trouble with my parents for buying candy! It wasn't much but I still felt bad.
<user1> I'm sure your dad wouldn't mind haha, its usually pretty cheap anything i remember they cost like $1.
<user1> Did you try to get the money from him? He sounds like a pretty bad person.
<user0> Yeah we tried but he cut all communication, he didn't respond to his phone number or anything. I hope he got fined a larger amount so it teaches him a lesson on laziness. 
<user1> I do too! People like that make me never want to have a roommate! 
<user1> Oh wow. That's pretty scary. I would be horrified.
<user0> Yeah it was quite an experience, my friends said those are usually drunk people who stay up the whole night talking with people. But they looked like they wanted to do more than talk!
<user1> Well, at least they didn't follow you. How is Cuba? My parents are from there but I've never been.
<user0> Its great, very beautiful and amazing culture (and food!). Just don't drive if you go, they seriously drive like maniacs haha
<user0> Oh no! That's sad, did he get them all?
<user1> Yes, it did! I think it was a dog that always gets out of our neighbor's yard.
<user0> Aw, that's too bad, hopefully next time they will be safe in the coop!
<user0> wow, so what are you going to do with it?
<user1> Oh i just put it into a little piggy bank i have, trying to get to $220 to cop some yeezys that are coming out in october. Hope i get a pair!
<user0> nice, i hope that works out for you... good luck
<user0> That is gross, I can't even imagine what that would taste like!
<user1> He said it had the texture of hard rubber and tasted of pure algae and just dead stuff. He even ate another one that he pan-fried and it was all green and moldy.
<user0> That's so gross, I would take a hard pass on eating that. I like seafood but that's too much.
<user0> Omg, Thankfully he wasn't hurt. 
<user1> Yeah i was really nervous that he was gonna get hurt since he likes to do stupid dares. It was quite the experience.
<user0> Did yall happen to get it on video? 
<user1> No sadly, nobody had their phones with them at the moment. But theres plenty of videos on youtube showing what happens if you dont make it!
<user1> Congrats!, I'm sure you must be very happy!
<user0> I am very happy for him! I thought it was never going to happen!
<user1> Haha brotherly love, I hope him and the lucky gal have a wonderful life together!
<user1> thats amazing i cant wait to have my own one day
<user0> It can be hard but it's one of the best experiences that I have had in life.
<user1> i bet so!
<user1> Is there something that is making you nervous about the upcoming week?
<user0> very busy and lots of traveling
<user1> That can be stressful. I am sure that every thing with go smoothly for you! Just remember that the weekend is only 5 days away! 
<user1> We all do stuff like that. At least you didn't lock them inside your car. Done that before!
<user0> Oh thankfully i've never had to go through that yet. That one would really suck!
<user1> Yeah nothing like calling the locksmith and admitting you are not very bright. Haha.
<user1> Did you not want to go out, or did you just not like the movie?
<user0> I was tired and wanted to get in bed early,
<user1> Just be careful with that. If you feel tired due to stress, it may be the stress talking and not you.
<user1> Great, when will you know your scores?
<user0> Thankfully i knew them right at the spot, i got a 98!
<user1> Wow, that's fantastic.
<user1> Who doesn't?
<user0> My husband doesn't see flirting with girls a problem. 
<user1> What a jerk! That is definitely a problem!
<user1> That's a real bummer. Do you at least pass the class?
<user0> Yeah, passed with a 75, not what i wanted but at least i passed
<user1> Well at least you don't have to take it again. Could have been worse.
<user1> Oh no, how awful for you! I hope people helped you to pick them up (and didn't help themselves!).
<user0> i grabbed the cans that rolled away, lol
<user1> Glad you find humor in it! I dropped a bottle of water once, which rolled under the car. I was livid!
<user1> That's extremely frustrating! What were they expecting you to do? It's not your fault your roommate left it trashed.
<user0> Yeah thats what we told them but they showed us the paper saying that its one of the rules. We were so furious at that guy, worst thing is he never responded to our calls or texts. Really immature and selfish of him.
<user1> Well, I guess the good news is that he no longer lives with you. But that blows, how hard is it to clean up after yourself before you leave?
<user1> That is so annoying. They should not call it that if they can't guarantee 10 minutes.
<user0> That's what I told the hostess. There was no point in calling ahead if we still have to wait 45 minutes for a table.
<user1> Hopefully the food was at least worth the wait. I would have been annoyed as well.
<user0> The food made it worth the wait, for sure! Any other restaurant I would have walked out!
<user0> Oh god! I haven't had a puppy in a long time, but you forget all the things in your house that are not puppy-proof. They find ways to make messes in the most creative ways.
<user1> They do! I'm really glad that that stage didn't last too long in him. I just hated having to buy an entire new living room suite! Puppies are expensive.
<user0> Yeah, that's a real headache. I'd want to say they're worth it, but on that day I wouldn't be so sure, haha.
<user0> That is a huge blessing, I don't know about you but my life is pretty much keyed into my phone.
<user1> Same here, they're so incredibly important in this day and age.
<user0> It's almost a shame how much we depend on them, but I know I'd be lost without mine.
<user0> Do they run them all day long - or at night?
<user1> during the morning and day on the weekends!
<user0> Is there any kind of noise ordinance in your area?  I know in ours unless they are still running them at 11pm, there is nothing the police will/can do about it unfortunately - but I can imagine how annoying it is.
<user0> I don't blame  you because I hate camping.
<user1> Really? I was just really scared of getting bitten by a tick. I ended up enjoying the trip in the end!
<user0> Oh I hate ticks and all the bugs.
<user0> What happened?
<user1> they were very supportive and kind , helping me with some moving things
<user0> You are lucky to have such great friends!
<user0> oh that sucks, i hope it has healed since then
<user1> It has! The cut was so deep and I was bleeding so much I was scared of passing out from blood loss.
<user0> ouch, that sounds awful
<user1> Moral of the story: don't rip open cans with your hands!
<user1> How come? Have you had awful weather lately?
<user0> not really but it was just especially nice this morning
<user1> Oh I see. Beautiful weather is an excellent start to the day!
<user1> Oh? Big decision. I hope you feel good about it!
<user0> I did, but I had to leave all my family behind
<user1> Aw, but they'll always be there for you when you visit. You have to do what you want to in life, after all
<user1> Oh that sucks! What did your neighbor do to get you angry?
<user0> he was using powertools loud in the morning
<user1> How inconsiderate. People should have more common sense than your neighbor.
<user1> thats awesome, i always loved giving gifts more than receiving them
<user0> Me too! The act of giving makes me feel so warm and happy.
<user1> me too!
<user1> I hate when I get teachers that are clueless. Makes you wonder how they got the job.
<user0> Same here. Surprisingly, I was able to pass the course and I felt so good about myself!
<user1> Well done. You should feel proud for teaching yourself.
<user1> That's always a great start to a day.
<user0> absolutely, i was overjoyed
<user1> How are you celebrating it?
<user1> Oh wow. What's the exam on?
<user0> It's on PC Architecture. I'm feeling pretty good about it though. I studied really hard all week.
<user1> That's really great. I am sure you will do well on the test.
<user1> Oh no, what happened?
<user0> I think the other driver was falling asleep on the road. Out of nowhere, he moved onto the wrong lane directly towards us.
<user1> Well that is really lucky you were able to avoid that. Hopefully he didn't hurt anyone else.
<user0> Agreed. I was so scared we could have been the ones in a casket that night.
<user0> Congratulations! Retail really does suck.
<user1> Yeah it does. It really made me dislike people a lot.
<user0> Understandably. My girlfriend is a student and works in retail part-time. She says the same thing.
<user0> Oh, all the time. What album is that for you?
<user1> I just listened to a Billy Talent album again the other day and it brought me back to high school and reminded me of the person who showed me them.
<user0> I really love that album! We will have to listen to it together sometime.
<user0> That sucks. Did she make a lot of money off of it?
<user1> No idea. All I know is that I was furious, especially seeing as my brother is the sweetest most innocent kid ever.
<user0> I would've been very angry too. I hope the money went towards something useful.
<user0> I am sorry to hear that. Why was it a bummer?
<user1> I was planning on going to a concert but ended up not going at the last minute because I didn't want to go by myself. I feel like I'm going to regret not going.
<user0> That really stinks. I bet you felt really lonely and filled my regret.
<user0> That must feel very refreshing. Would you say you feel content?
<user1> It is, I'm super happy. Currently playing some Zelda on the Switch, it couldn't get any better than this!
<user0> Nice! I want to get that game next week. Looks really cool.
<user1> I highly recommend it. I can't put it down.
<user1> That is disappointing. I wonder why he's like that.
<user0> I don't know why. Recently we were supposed to go out for sushi lunch together, but he keeps postponing it. I'll ask him for a definitive day.
<user1> I hope he doesn't let you down.
<user1> Something good happen to him recently?
<user0> He just graduated from college. He put in so much work.
<user1> That's amazing! Tell him congratulations from a friendly stranger.
<user1> Oh no, that's not good! He's not the only one that's not great at French. Most of my family spoke French as a second language when I was growing up and I still never picked it up!
<user0> French is a really hard language, I have trouble too so it really hurt my heart seeing him go to school while all his friends and siblings were having fun without him.
<user1> Hopefully he'll get to enjoy his next summer.
<user1> That sucks. Did anyone get hurt?
<user0> Some things got broke and there were some bruises, but it was really scary to watch that.
<user1> I bet. I would've hid under the table.
<user1> That's nice. Why do you say that?
<user0> they're just the best and always very helpful
<user1> That's great to hear. I wish I had a helpful family.
<user1> That's really selfish. Have you talked to her about it?
<user0> Yeah, but she says she tries her best and thinks she is doing what is best for everyone. However, we are the only ones with kids on a schedule.
<user1> Well, at least that's the case. People can only do so much.
<user1> Oh yeah? Why is that?
<user0> I couldn't find anyone that wanted to hangout so I had to spend the whole weekend by myself.
<user1> Well sometimes that isn't a bad thing really. You didn't enjoy it at all?
<user0> I was feeling quite social, though, so it was kind of a buzzkill.
<user0> Are the good memories at least?
<user1> Oh yeah, but it really makes me miss those times.
<user0> At least you have those memories. You should go on a vacation soon!
<user0> Which one?
<user1> The new Spyro Remastered. It really makes feel think back to when I used to play the original with an old friend of mine. 
<user0> I've actually haven't played that series. When does it come out?
<user1> It comes out next month!
<user1> That's rough. Why can't you help her?
<user0> I just have too much going on now with two kids, and working from home.
<user1> Yeah, I am in the same boat. It's a hard knock life out there.
<user1> How long did it take them?
<user0> I think he was making a Youtube video so he was eating very fast, so like 10 minutes
<user1> He must of been sick after.
<user1> That was probably a good plan to buy them ahead of time
<user0> Yup, people started charging like $5 per bottle of water
<user1> Wow, thats insane.  I feel like thats illegal
<user1> What was the news?
<user0> My son got caught cheating on a test. I really thought we raised him better than to do such things but here we are.
<user1> Are you going to ground him?
<user0> Definitely at least going to have a long talk about why what he did was wrong. There will be some kind of punishment that's for sure.
<user0> Why don't you join them?
<user1> We definitely don't have money for that, plus there are four of us.
<user0> Why don't you get another job?
<user0> That's too bad. What happened? Is everyone OK?
<user1> I got news that my grandfather passed away. He was old but no one saw it coming. 
<user0> Oh I'm so sorry to hear that. I hoep your family is strong enough to support you through this.
<user0> Holy cow.  Was anything missing?
<user1> no and that was the weird thing nothing was taken
<user0> Had they gone through anything?
<user0> oh yeah that must have been a good time
<user1> It was! He got a lot of cool toys, and ate a bunch of ice cream.
<user0> Those are the best times when they still like to play with toy's mine lost interest years ago and I miss it
<user1> As he opened gifts, he told people thank you, and told them thanks for coming when they left.  I was pretty proud of our 4 year-old.
<user1> that is awesome i will never forget the first time me and my wife went on vacation, where do you have planned to go?
<user0> We are going to Hawaii for a whole week. We have saved a long time to be able to afford this, I can barely wait till next month.
<user1> That sounds like you guys will spend a lovely time over there good luck
<user1> I miss her. You haven't seen your mom in a long time?
<user0> Why! what is the reason
<user1> I'm sorry, but I can't understand what you're saying.
<user0> Are you were near to your mom
<user0> Oh man! I have been there, I hope you didn't have anything special down there??
<user1> I lost all of my childhood photos and many of my childhood toys and things I had saved, my bible from my late grandmother being one of the items.
<user0> Oh lord, i am so sorry! I have been there, that is hard!
<user0> taht sounds like fun, i wish i had coworkers that nice ahahah. did you enjoy the party?
<user1> Yes, it was great. I had no idea it was even happening, they are so sneaky.
<user0> ahahaah seems to be they really like you working threre
<user0> Aww, I'm sorry.  Is he going to be ok?
<user1> It's not looking too good. I really hope he pulls through.
<user0> I do too.  That's one of the saddest things.  I hope you'll be OK too.
<user0> wow nice
<user1> Not really, it still hasn't shown up!  I'm pretty annoyed!
<user0> ooops sorry to hear that
<user1> It's not that big of a deal, but I was really looking forward to finishing the project.
<user1> oh that sucks.. did someone move it out of the way?
<user0> It wasn't dead, It was injured and moved to the brush on the side of the road. it was upsetting.
<user1> yea you never like to see stuff like that.
<user1> did you try to find its owner?
<user0> I asked my neighbors about it, no one knew anything about it. I guess it was left there intentionally.
<user1> well that was nice of someone
<user1> That's annoying, are you going to talk to them about it?
<user0> I plan on doing that, it's pretty disruptive
<user1> I hope it all works out in the end.
<user1> Awesome! Can you say what kind of project it is?
<user0> Not at the moment, but I'm praying my supervisor and client likes it
<user1> I hope so too! Projects can be stressful!
<user1> What is the appointment for?
<user0> My cat hasn't been feeling well this past week, I think there might be something really wrong.
<user1> Let's hope not! My prayers are with her.
<user0> I know. I'm so worried.
<user0> You're welcome. It's always nerve wrecking when family is sick like that.
<user1> 5
<user0> I think there might be something wrong with the platform at the moment.
<user0> Oh man, sounds like most kids. She's gonna hate it at first, but getting to bed early will help with her future.
<user1> I've tried to explain that to her. It's like it goes in one ear and out the other. It bugs me.
<user0> Well yea, they're young right now and can't see the consequences yet.
<user0> that is so lucky, they must be so happy they bought that ticket
<user1> They had asked me if I wanted to go in with them, and I said no. I regret that now, I could have really used a share of that money.
<user0> i know that is such a bomber you must have been so angry hahaha
<user0> What kind of test is it
<user1> It was my science final for college. 
<user0> Oh I hope you do well then
<user0> wow i didnt even know they had cruises that go on for that long
<user1> Right? Talk about ultimate relaxation!
<user0> yea i wonder how much something like that costs .. i guess if you have to ask you cant afford it as they say
<user0> that is really nice of him, how much time will you have to wait?
<user1> Hopefully not too much longer. I've been waiting for a few days now.
<user0> well i hope everything goes well at the bank and with the transaction
<user0> that is horrible, natural disaster are the worst because you cant do anything against them
<user1> No, all you can do is try to prepare. Do you live anywhere where there is threat of natural disasters? 
<user0> not really, the worst thing that can happen where i live is a thunderstorm
<user0> I bet that was a wonderful day
<user1> It really was, my life finally felt complete.
<user0> I am very happy for you
<user0> that is not good, have you expressed your feelings to your boss?
<user1> I did, and it looks like I may be looking for a new job soon as they want to take the company in a new direction.
<user0> well i hope everything goes well for you, you will sure find something fitting for you dont worry
<user0> It's a whole new world when that happens, I can totally understand. How'd you cope with it?
<user1> I just tried to keep an open mind and go with the flow. It was hard to get used to sitting at a desk for 8 hours a day, but I soon got used to it.
<user0> It's always best to just open your mind to anything that could happen. It's the best way to learn.
<user1> I agree. And if it doesn't work out, you can always move on to something different.
<user1> Oh no, that's bad.   Have you had someone come out and check the hose?
<user0> I ended up cleaning it myself, I think I got most of it out
<user1> May be worth letting your insruance comapny know. Usually they have clauses that you have to tell them as soon as you see it otherwise they won't cover any of it.
<user1> what is that?
<user0> It's our Rotty pup! Sorry haha
<user1> oh that explains it!
<user0> Yes!  We had been waiting forever to find just the right breeder and then we found him oh my gosh.  That felt like the longest week of my life!
<user0> Wow when the child just asked?!
<user1> Yes! It was awful! Luckily the man behind her spoke up. I could tell she was embarrassed but I was furious at her!
<user0> I'm only afraid that the mom is going to let out that embarassment on her child once they get home.
<user1> I agree. I hate seeing kids having to live in that type of situation. some people shouldn't be parents
<user1> OMG that's so gross! 
<user0> Yes, I wanted to throw it back at them!
<user1> That would be a memorable lesson to learn. The best lessons are learned that hard way, after all. 
<user1> Oh god. That's kinda gross.
<user0> I felt gross hahaha I kicked it off of my shoe and stuffed it under a rack. I hope know one saw.
<user1> Rest in peace whoever touches that rack.
<user0> hahaha hope they wear gloves!
<user0> Oh dear. How do they let the parents know what's going on?
<user1> I sometimes find out but it seems so disorganized!
<user0> That sounds really frustrating. I'm sorry that's happening!
<user0> Oh wow.  Terrifying.  All I think of is Johnny Erricson Tada, who broke her neck in that situation. Did you do it?
<user1> That was what I was worried about! I ended up not jumping off of the highest one. I was too scared. I did jump off of the smallest one. That was really fun!
<user0> You did the right thing!  Oh fun!  I'm glad you were safe and had a blast! 
<user0> Do you feel ready for it?
<user1> Oh yeah, I'm definitely ready. I know I'm going to pass.
<user0> Awesome, hope it goes as planned!
<user0> Oh how exciting! Did you take any pictures?
<user1> No. my camera isn't good enough to get good pictures, they are so small.
<user0> Awww...that's a bit disappointing, but really cool that you got to see them!
<user0> The market can be competitive if the price is right. They'll sell immediatley.
<user1> It is a piece of property that my grandfather owned and I pretty much grew up on, I would have really liked to have owned it.
<user0> That would have been awesome if you got it.
<user0> That's good! That probably means you worked on it until it became something you're proud of.
<user1> You are right! I was really proud of it! I'm glad I worked so hard on it. It lessened the anxiety that I usually have!
<user0> Maybe I could learn from that. I get really nervous when I have to do any public speaking, so maybe if I just prepared for it better it would help.
<user0> What did they do to you?
<user1> They owed me money but never paid me back. I suppose it's not a huge deal though.
<user0> It happens sometimes. you may ask them directly to pay back.
<user0> I totally get that.  I'm in the same place with my daughter.  I home school and she's learning them too. Give it time and she'll get it soon.  Its so much to memorize at once! 
<user1> We homeschool too! I hope she can get them soon! It will make this year's math so much easier!
<user0> That's awesome!  She will!  The best thing about homeschooling is that they can learn more at their own pace.  I'm not looking forward to division! ha ha
<user0> Do you hike very often?
<user1> Here and there when I have time
<user0> I've never been hiking, really! I'd like to go some day.
<user0> Oh, such fun!  Do you have all the Stamp It Up scrapbooking things I hear so much about? I bet it can be hard to keep it updated! They grow so fast!
<user1> My son just started school all day, so I plan to start scrapbooking.  I don't use Stamp It Up though.
<user0> Perfect!  Now you'll be caught up in no time.  I know you'll be so gratified to finish and be able to look at all of them when he's much older.
<user0> So sorry to hear of Sam's passing.
<user1> Yeah,it's been really strange the past few days without him asleep on my feet while I work.
<user0> May your many memories of Sam help you to sustain at this difficult time.
<user0> That is awesome.  I'm with you on that.  Tough times might pop up now and then but life really is great.  I don't like to take it for granted.
<user1> No point in being a pessimist.
<user0> Exactly! You'll go far with that attitude!  
<user0> Mmm, now you're making me hungry for cake. What kind of cake was it?
<user1> Black forest cake! It happens to be both our favorite kind of cake. I made it from scratch. What's your favorite cake? 
<user0> Personally I'm a huge fan of red velvet, but black forest is amazing too!
<user0> Aww, I know that can be hard, but you can't be too hard on yourself.  Sometimes you don't have a choice.
<user1> I know. She was so excited when we came home though which made us feel a bit better. 
<user0> Absence makes the heart grow fonder.
<user0> What are some of your best traits?
<user1> I'm healthy!
<user0> Do you exercise often?
<user0> Oh boy that is great news! I hope you didn't drop a pretty penny on it! Haha, and even if you did, dogs are worth it.
<user1> No he was the runt so we got him on the cheap side!  He is sooooo sweet!  I am so happy
<user0> Hey runts are the best! They need love too. Either way, I'm glad you were paired up with the perfect companion.
<user1> Thank you!  We are so excited!
<user1> I've never been, but it looks like so much fun.
<user0> It is a great place for both kids and adults! I don't have any kids yet, but can't wait to bring mine when I have them someday. 
<user1> It would be so much fun to go there as a family.
<user1> Oh yeah I am right there with you, I just don't even go out anymore if I can help it! How old is yours? Mines 2 1/2
<user0> Mine is 5.  Every now and then, he says a curse word, uses it properly too!
<user1> They are too smart for their own good
<user1> what did you see? please don't tell me there was a bug in your bread
<user0> No, there weren't any bugs. But there was mold.
<user1> ewwww, so nasty! i almost ate a molded avocado today. good thing i noticed before scooping it
<user1> or maybe she just knows you're a great worker and very responsible? I hope you will get a raise after completing those tasks
<user0> Ha, that's a really nice way of looking at it but nah I'm pretty sure it's mostly laziness.
<user1> did you try talking to her about it? Just be straight forward and tell you how you feel
<user0> I thought about it but no, it's not worth rocking the boat. If she tries to pull that again and dump even more on us, then I'll probably say something.
<user0> Did you call the police?
<user1> No!  I got so flustered and kind of paniked.  
<user0> Its horrible to have to got through things like thaty
<user0> That's great! I'm so happy for you!
<user1> Thank you! I worked so hard and I am so freaking excited!  I am also up for a promotion if we keep growing!
<user0> Ooh, will you be managing anyone?
<user0> I hear you! I drop things all the time. Was it one you just bought?
<user1> Yes.  And to make it even worse I soaked myself!
<user0> Ugh! Were you away from home?
<user1> Right outside the office and with no spare clothes!
<user1> Oh wow, she's doing great. I know it probably feels a bit bad that she's making so much more than you, but hopefully you can find  away to be proud of her.
<user0> I'm definitely proud! It doesn't feel bad at all. I'm so happy about how much drive she has to succeed.
<user1> Oh well that's great! Some people would get a little jealous. I'm glad you're proud of her, I'm sure she worked very hard for her success!
<user0> I'm maybe a little jealous, but I know how hard she works and how smart she has been with her decisions.
<user0> That is a good feeling!
<user1> It really is! Now I can go home and just relax for the rest of the evening.
<user0> Nice! No kids at home?
<user1> Nope, just me. So it's nice and quiet.
<user1> Are you afraid of the dentist?
<user0> I am!  I had a bad experience with one when I was younger.
<user1> I'm sorry to hear that, I'm pretty terrified of the dentist myself. Ask for gas! Good luck, I'm sure everything will be just fine.
<user1> Oh nice! That's super brave of you.
<user0> I'm actually one of those fortunate people who doesn't have a fear of public speaking. 
<user1> That's a great skill to have!
<user1> That must have been a nice feeling. 
<user0> It really was. I miss a lot of the people in the photos, made me really smile to see their faces again.
<user1> I love that nostalgic feeling. 
<user1> Haha, sounds like my pupper, is she still young?
<user0> Yeah she's only about six months.  Despite all her chew toys its still my shoes she craves...
<user1> Right!? It's weird, you buy them all the toys in the world, but they still go after your stuff.
<user1> Why he is working late?
<user0> He owns his own business working on cars. If something goes wrong, he is forced to stay to fix the issue.
<user1> I understand. Could you plan to do something when he is late (going out with friends)?
<user0> That's a good idea! Maybe I can have a boardgame night or something!
<user0> Aww man that sucks for you 
<user1> It does! Maybe he will at least let me drive it!
<user0> Hopefully! It is your dream car after all
<user0> That should be fun. Any big planes?
<user1> Nothing too big, probably just wander around town
<user0> That will be nice to catch up.
<user0> That's not very considerate of her. Was she a bad neighbor while she lived there too? Some people!
<user1> Not at all, that's what is so weird! She was really polite, quiet, and neat.
<user0> I wonder what could have changed? Either way, I'd be pretty pissed off.
<user1> I am! But whatever, nothing we can do but have the city come pick it up I guess.
<user1> Oh no! That is terrible!
<user0> I was fortunate enough to be one of the very few who got to keep their job, I am happy but very sad for the others.
<user1> I understand. Layoffs are hard. My brother in law has been through a lot of those at factories!
<user1> How do you feel these days?
<user0> It has gotten a little better with time, but still a pretty sore spot for me.
<user1> It must be difficult, do you think she will come back ever?
<user1> Ouch! That's rather painful. What are you doing now?
<user0> Well that's the cool thing... the week my unemployment ran out I got a job offer. At my former company, no less. So everything worked out!
<user1> Wow! That's like a paid vacation!
<user0> Haha that's an awesome way to think about it!
<user0> Wow, that's incredible. What's their secret? 
<user1> Right place, right time I guess. Some people are just lucky.
<user0> Congrats to your friend. I hope they share!
<user0> That's unfortunate, hope you don't get it as well!
<user1> I know!  I've been pretty worried about her.  She's such a tiny thing.
<user0> I'm sure she will be fine with some rest and a little bit of time. 
<user0> Wow... that's kind of creepy actually. Were you able to get it back?
<user1> I was! The guy was really nice and refused the cash I tried to give him as a reward.
<user0> You're very lucky he was nice and didn't steal any of your data.
<user1> Very! Lucky for me it was a cheap phone, I think if I had the newest iPhone or something I would have never seen it again.
<user1> Did you bring them a pan of ludefisk first? What did they say?
<user0> Nah, although I did consider brownies. They were happy to meet me so it was all good. But man I couldn't believe how nice their place looked compared to mine! I am a little jealous of their interior decorating skills.
<user1> Next time they let you in, just steal all your favorite pieces of decor and replace them with brownies.
<user1> Yeah, they are cute like that. How old is she ?
<user0> She almost 11 now. She loves to listen to all of the bands from when I was younger. It's really cute.
<user1> I have a 10 year old like that.
<user1> that's amazing. watching your children succeed is so rewarding
<user0> It is! I cannot wait to see what's in store for her future! Maybe a scholarship!
<user1> that is awesome. i hope she has very much success in her gymnastic endevours.
<user0> thank you!
<user1> you are very welcome. good luck!
<user1> That's awful! I hope that she didn't mean too!
<user0> I don't think she realized what they were. I was pretty irritated as they can't be replaced but what can you do?
<user1> Yeah, It really sounds like she didn't mean to. Sometimes you can find copies online if you look. 
<user0> Good suggestion! Really I wanted to keep all the signatures and notes from my friends but oh well. I will see them next month for our reunion anyway!
<user0> I'm so so sorry!  We lost our chihuahua in February, so I completely understand that feeling.  Was he sick prior to passing away or was it sudden?
<user1> It was sudden. He was completely fine when we went to bed. No issues at all. Its been hard for our daughter
<user0> I think it might actually be harder to watch our kids go through that kind of loss than to actually go through it ourselves.  Our pup was our daughter's dog and she was sick prior to passing, so we knew it was coming.  Still doesn't really help though.  We ended up adopting a pup from the shelter that had lost her human mom - it was meant to me - my daughter lost her pup and this pup had lost her mom.  It's helped, something to think about at least.
<user1> I completely agree. I broke down just watching her cry at the spot where we buried him. I'm not sure if I want to get another dog yet. We have chickens so she's began to show them more attention now.
<user1> I am sure she will be smart with it
<user0> I hope so. She has done well with tablets so I'm hoping she'll do the same with a phone
<user1> You can always show her the ways
<user0> This is true! I also put an app on her phone to block things she's not old enough to use
<user0> Were they okay?
<user1> Yeah thankfully he was totally fine. But I felt so bad.
<user0> At least you're not getting sued
<user1> Oh man, that would be terrible. Way to look on the bright side!
<user0> Im good at that lol
<user0> Don't worry you'll be fine.  It's safe.
<user1> This is my 3rd time and I'm still scared
<user0> I'm surprised you haven't started to relax a little yet.
<user1> Have you ever went. When you looking down from 15,000 feet you get scared.
<user1> I can only imagine. At least its nice in the day time though?
<user0> Sometimes. I try to avoid that attic during any time of the day! There's also a weird door about knee-height. When you open it up, it's just big enough to fit a storage tub.
<user1> I am not sure I would do well in that house
<user0> It is really creepy! 
<user0> Bet that brought back good memories.
<user1> Definitely, brought me right back to the road trips we took when I was younger.
<user0> Where did you guys usually go?
<user1> Everywhere! Sometimes we just hopped in the car and went like two or three hours from home just to do something for the day.
<user1> whats the competition on ?
<user0> Highland games. I throw the caber and heavy hammer.
<user1> Nice hope you win , ill be looking into this further 
<user1> I wonder how that was noted on your report.
<user0> I got a raise so not that bad but it was still off putting. I've heard her rip one in the past so I guess no judgement. 
<user1> Sounds like a wacky place to work.
<user1> That is awesome. Congratulations. Im sure you earned every penny.
<user0> Thanks it's been a rough year. My hours were cut but I was expected to keep up the same work load. Thanks again!
<user1> Good things happen to people who put in the effort. It sounds well deserved.
<user1> Oh no! Do you think it's a wild animal?
<user0> I don't think so, it doesn't sound like any animal I recognize. It's really creepy.
<user1> I hope it's not a crazy person or worse, an alien waiting to abduct you!
<user1> Its so hard to monitor that stuff now
<user0> It is! There's also a ton of weird stuff on there that's labeled for kids.
<user1> Yeah, that is a scary thing to think about too
<user1> On no!  That is no good!  Is he still a puppy?
<user0> No! He's about 2 years old now. Sometimes I think he does it out a spite when he's not getting enough attention!
<user1> Hopefully he is not doing it out of spite!  Maybe you should hire a dog trainer to see if they can correct his behavior.
<user0> That's not a bad idea!
<user0> No way? Do you have proof? That is terrible.
<user1> So check this out, I ordered a planter for my porch. That's how I know he did it, the exact planter I ordered and never got appeared on HIS porch a few days after my package went missing!
<user0> Wow. That is horrible. I would get a camera and try to film them in the act and go to the police. I would be so angry.
<user1> Yeah, I'm pretty livid. I think I will report him to our HOA and see what they say.
<user1> you havent met all three people in the city yet?
<user0> haha. I live about 1 hour south of Barrow the most northern place in the USA and about 12 hours north of any actual city. 
<user1> ah well it sounds like i hit the nail on the head
<user0> It's the most beautiful place you can move just no one here. Me and the animals. 
<user0> What kind of job was it
<user1> Sales, so I'm not really envious about that part as I'm not into sales but I was still upset that he found a job so easily and I couldn't. We both wanted out of that company so bad.
<user0> Sales do sound hard to do
<user0> Is he going to be okay
<user1> Yes, thankfully! The vet gave him some fluids and I made sure he got some food in him. He's doing much better today.
<user0> I am glad then, I hate to see pets in pain
<user0> That is quite an accomplishment.  Someone like that is really inspiring.
<user1> Right? I'm so proud of her. Her accomplishment really made me think about just how lazy I am in my own life haha
<user0> Hahahaha, it's hard to compare yourself with that, but it really let's you know what's possible if you really want something.
<user0> Why? Were they not working?
<user1> He called in sick, but spent the day at the waterpark with his kids. I didn't realize he'd called in sick, I thought he was just out. So, I accidentally told my boss where he was.
<user0> He should have been honest from the start. It's on him not you.
<user1> Thanks, that's a good point. Or at least let me know he's going to lie so I can cover for him!
<user0> Do you think your boss will tell him it's you that told on him?
<user0> That's so cool! Do you do a lot of climbing?
<user1> Not so much any more that I moved to the east coast. I do more surfing now but I was able to get off work so I fly into Colorado Thursday.
<user0> Wow, so a proper adventure then. Have fun and stay safe!
<user0> yea funny how that happens
<user1> It was not even that long ago I went to that school. It's been less then 10 years. They did not even build anything. It's a park now.
<user0> well at least its being put to good use
<user0> Hey congrats!  Is it in the same field?
<user1> Yes, I'm currently in middle management this would be the next step up. I'm excited and nervous 
<user0> Heyyy! That's awesome!  I wish you luck! Will it come with a sweet raise too?
<user0> Congratulation. What is he planning to do next?
<user1> She's already working at a Big 4 firm so she's just going to stick with that for a few years. I'm proud of her, it wasn't easy!
<user0> Good. I hope it will help her in career growth.
<user0> That's cool!  Maybe you'll get along great!
<user1> I plan to steer clear. I'm going to relocate in January so I just need to lay low. I hope she does a great job.
<user0> lol why do you have to steer clear?
<user1> I'm not looking to make a good or bad impression. I just want to do my job and go home. 
<user0> ahhh.  I got you!  Well good luck on the relocation!
<user0> That is a bad realization to come to.  Where did they all go?
<user1> Well I used to hang out with a lot of my coworkers but I left that job. And just kind of drifted away from everyone else. I definitely need to find a new sport or something and make new friends.
<user0> Yeah, that is tough.  Once you get to a certain age you have to work pretty hard to meet people.  Maybe you could join a softball league, that's what I did.
<user0> It can be hard these days, money is tight
<user1> So true. I lucked out though and found a $20 bill on the ground! I hope the person who lost it didn't need it really bad because it definitely helped me out.
<user0> I bet that was a nice surprise
<user0> Did you get it all straightened out?
<user1> Yes I was very stun someone did a good deed and turned it in with my wallet and all the money in it I was very grateful. 
<user0> Wow that is awesome, too rare in these times, count your lucky stars!
<user0> Oh wonderful!  I'm glad it went so well!  Did she already know some friends there or was it a new school for her?
<user1> A new school that's why I was kind of nervous and scared but she loved it.
<user0> Oh boy, I bet you were nervous.  I would've been too!  Sounds like she's got a great and fun year ahead of her!
<user0> That is just gross!  Have you spoken to her about it?
<user1> It's revolting. I reported her to the HOA but she keeps doing it. I'm going to say something if I catch her out there letting her dog out.
<user0> I hope the HOA does something about that - that's just disgusting!
<user0> Bet that was a nice calming down.
<user1> Very. It was nice and chill and low pressure, just how I like it.
<user0> Did you get up to anything else fun?
<user1> Not doing anything WAS my idea of fun!
<user1> That sounds awesome, i bet you feel proud! Its nice to do things for kids who are in need.
<user0> I did before the walk I was un-assured I would finish but I did so I was overly proud and it was a great cause that raised lots of money. 
<user1> Of course! Dont let fear of not finishing stop you from doing anything!
<user1> Oh gross, I would lose my appetite
<user0> It really was gross. I was so grossed out I asked to get moved to the bar so we could get a different server.
<user1> Yeah, I would probably just leave the restaurant altogether
<user1> Oh my goodness, that is no fun.  Was it poisonous?
<user0> When I looked it up on line it was one of the garden snakes but I'm still frightened by them all lol even the harmless ones. 
<user1> They can still bite, so it's better safe than sorry.  My father-in-law just got bitten by a black snake recently-not poisonous-but still painful.
<user0> I will stay clear of them all not taking any chances. 
<user0> Do you have OCD?
<user1> Very bad and when my family has the house out of place I become so furious I just like things clean and in order.
<user0> I just love when the house is clean, makes you feel good.
<user1> Yes and so relaxed and peaceful. 
<user1> That's a bad supervisor. Did you call him/her out on it?
<user0> I totally did. And let the CEO know about his behavior.
<user1> I hope he got in trouble!
<user0> Unfortunately no, the CEO thinks he can do no wrong. Eventually he'll figure out what a jerk he is.
<user0> Oh most are dreading going back to school. What's your major?
<user1> I'm going for nursing and I have dreaded going back for 6 years now but my support system pushed me to follow my dream I'm thankful to have them.
<user0> Nursing can be difficult, but if you have determination and a good support system, I'm sure you'll do great!
<user1> It is but I know the hard work will pay off in the end.
<user1> How'd it go?
<user0> I didn't get it.
<user1> I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope another opportunity comes up.
<user0> Me, too.  Then I found out someone else less qualified got it.
<user0> That sounds like fun!  Are you big into biking?
<user1> I have been recently, yes. I'm using an old beat up hand-me-down mountain bike so getting the right bike for me is going to be so much fun.
<user0> Mountain biking is great.  Is is really theraputic.  I hope you enjoy your new bike
<user0> That's horrible. What can people do to change things?
<user1> First thing get the young crowd out the streets and take the weapons away a 7 year old passed this weekend because of this it is so heart breaking.
<user0> Yes! The weapons thing is so important. 
<user0> Oh my gosh! That is horrible! I am so sorry to hear that.
<user1> Thank you. I don't even have it in me to call her parents and offer my condolences yet, it's just too shocking.
<user0> I understand that. Just give it some time and call when you are ready.
<user0> That's great. Getting good coworkers is so hit or miss sometimes.
<user1> It is and that's why I was nervous but the staff was so kind and open. 
<user0> That sounds like a wonderful place. I'm kinda jealous hahaha.
<user1> Lol don't be let's just hope I can still say this in 3 months. 
<user1> That's awful! What did you do?
<user0> Nothing! My dog was just walking passed him!
<user1> No. I mean did you yell at the person or anything after they did it?
<user1> Woah that's really bad!! Is it due to cost cutting? They let you off.
<user0> Sort of, the company was being run into the ground by poor management. It hurt at first but then I realized just how much I'd started to hate the work and the company.
<user1> it happens!! i hope you will find a better job with a better company!!
<user1> Oh no, that's the worst.
<user0> Sad part is I have no idea which store that's why I am so upset.
<user1> I hope you can get it back somehow!
<user1> That is an amazing accomplishment.  What field are you in?
<user0> Finance, basically, but it was a little broader than that. I wish my mom were still around, she would have been so happy.
<user1> I'm sure you know that she is so proud of you!  That is really incredible!  Congratulations!
<user0> Thank you!
<user0> That is so romantic.  They weren't for any occasion?
<user1> Nope not at all, that's why I was so shocked! 
<user0> Were they your favorites?
<user0> Oh yuck. Did you get a chance to return it to the store?
<user1> I tried to, but they had a no refund policy. 
<user0> That's crazy! I'd leave it on the counter at the store. Hopefully you aren't out much money.
<user0> Wow that must have been amazing!
<user1> It really was, and I got it on video too.
<user0> They're going to remember that forever
<user0> Dang, that sucks. Did you ever catch the culprit?
<user1> No, they didn't leave a insurance card or anything, just drove off. Some people are so worthless.
<user0> Yeah, that guy sounds like a jerk. Did your insurance cover the dent?
<user0> Oh wow! My dog Jr died of old age too.
<user1> Man it's hard. He has been like my best friend since I was a teenager.
<user0> Oh, Did something happen to him?
<user0> I am sorry to hear that. Mine died of old age as well last month.
<user1> I am sorry that happened too. I never thought I would be this upset over a dog.
<user0> Me neither, but in the end, I really didn't think about him as a dog, he was just my buddy. I hope fond memories of him get you through this.
<user0> That can be so aggravating. Did the company make it up to you for being so late?
<user1> It got worse. When it finally arrived, the box was all busted up and my item was broken. So yeah, safe to say they had a lot to make up for.
<user0> At least they made up for it. If they had not I wouldn't use them again.
<user0> I know the feeling. What team is he rooting for? 
<user1> He is crazy about the Falcons.
<user0> I don't even know what team that is, haha. Football is lost on me. 
<user0> Oh that's good, last time my computer broke was a day before I left the country
<user1> That would be a nightmare! All I had to do was replace the fan.
<user0> I took it to the apple store and it actually got fixed in 5 mins, just needed a hardware reset
<user0> Oh my goodness, is he with the armed forces?
<user1> Yes the army, he will be there for 2 years.
<user0> I cannot imagine how hard that is on the family and the soldier.  While I can't bring him home quicker, I do want to say thank you to you,  him and your family for your sacrifice.
<user0> That is horrible, did anyone get hurt?
<user1> No, thank goodness no one was home, but their is nothing left of our house.
<user0> Hopefully you had insurance and somewhere to stay.
<user0> That is scary.  What was it?
<user1> It was a couple of drug addicts trying to come in!
<user0> Gosh It's worse than I thought it would be.  What did you do?
<user0> Sorry to hear that. What happened on the test?
<user1> exam mark is low in school
<user0> Hopefully next time you will get a better score and study more!
<user1> ok thank you
<user1> He must be very smart
<user0> yah, he had done his best
<user1> It paid off. Wish I was smart like that
<user1> Oh no. How old are you?
<user0> am 22 years of age
<user1> Is there anyone you could go and visit and maybe stay the night?
<user1> I'm sorry to hear that.
<user0> yah, i decided to sleep
<user1> I hope things are better next time.
<user1> That's great to hear that some really care and put effort in to their relationships!
<user0> He usually doesn't do this much! I guess after years of hinting, he's finally picking up on them! haha
<user1> Lol! Oh geez- so many take years to get it ugh! But at least he finally has! I hope he is very romantic too!
<user0> haha yeah it does! we've been together almost 15 years.
<user1> Congrats <3
<user1> Not yours? That is so weird, usually they  are on their way OUT not IN! Lol
<user0> I know! we were all surprised. My god was going nuts and my cat hid under the couch while we chased the stray around trying to get it out.
<user1> Did you eventually get it out? I would have been flipping bonkers! 
<user1> That sounds terrifying! Im glad you have a basement though, it can be so dangerous if you have no underground place to shelter in!
<user0> Yes, a lot of people don't have basements, and that would be really bad. It's hard to explain to a three year old why you are in such a dark, scary place, especially when the power is all out.
<user1> Oh your right, I have an almost 3 year old and I wouldn't know how to explain it as well! That is so hard sometimes because you don't know what to say!
<user1> Oh my goodness, are you alright? I bet you created a mess!
<user0> yeah! The only thing that was hurt was my pride! I've never tried to check out so quickly!
<user1> I hope you can laugh a little about it now!
<user1> That sounds like a great gift. That is going to be a great time.
<user0> It is! I'm really excited for it! It's tonight, so it was also a big surprise! 
<user1> Wow. I am sure you will remember this for a long time. You are going to have to think of a great surprise for him now.
<user0> I know! I wasn't really planning to do much this year hahaha
<user0> I'm sorry to hear about that. It sounds like, to me, that he lived a long life with you though, and that you were able to spend a lot of time with him. I'm worried for my girlfriend and what she'll do when that happens to her and her dog
<user1> Yeah, we did everything together. I still have to stop myself from calling him when I go to bed at night. It's amazing how close we can get to our pets.
<user0> That's crazy, and a little heart-breaking too. I'm envious of the bond and routine it sounds like you guys had. I have yet to develop a bond like that with a pet. I hope I do at some point
<user0> That's so sad...Did you have a lot of good memories in that house?
<user1> I spent birth till I was 17 living there, so literally all of my child hood memories. 
<user0> I'm so sorry :( At least you have your memories to look back on.
<user0> That was really nice of him. I know that she had to be relieved.
<user1> As was I. I was about 50 miles away at the time and she was on the side of the highway.
<user0> Someone was watching over her.
<user0> How long had you been married ?
<user1> Just short of 9 years. She met someone online in WoW of all places and just up and moved in with him.
<user0> Hmm. That's a bit of a strange story.
<user0> I hate to hear that. I hate tickets. There are so many other things I would rather spend my money on.
<user1> Exactly, especially when you get one for just walking.
<user0> Yeah, that is such a silly thing to get a ticket for.
<user0> Cool, what are you getting?
<user1> A Chevy Cruze. We have been working hard to get our credit score up to get a really good interest rate.
<user0> That's a nice car, you are going to enjoy it.
<user0> Neat! We took our daughter and her cousin camping about 2 weeks ago! Did ya'll build a fire?
<user1> Of course!  I have found that the key to a great camping experience is to have a checklist of what to bring, and follow it.
<user0> That's defiantly a priority! I hope you brought everything that you need. Forgetting something can be a pain
<user0> The 1-6 times as in multiplication?  Teaching children is so rewarding.
<user1> Yes in multiplication! I'm glad she's finally grasped them. Now we just need to work on 6-12 hahaha
<user0> I bet she was super excited to get it all down.
<user1> She was!
<user1> What grade is she in?
<user0> She is in 5th grade.
<user1> What kind of school was she at before?
<user0> We have been homeschooling. I'm having to go back to work now, so she's not too happy about it. I think she will be just fine that. She's well socialized 
<user0> Where did you go ?
<user1> We went to Disney world in Orlando,Fl to see my kids have a great time made me happy can't wait for our next vacation.
<user0> We went there a few years back. Had a great time.
<user0> Awesome news!  What was the response?
<user1> Well, they decided not to hire me. This stinks.
<user0> Oh.  Not so good news then :(  I'm sorry.  I'm sure you'll find something!
<user0> That's awesome, I bet you were overjoyed with it!
<user1> I couldn't believe that no one let the cat out of the bag. It must have been hard to plan.
<user0> You never know if someone is going to slip and spoil it for you, that's true!
<user0> Oh no!  Do you have any way of finding out who did it?
<user1> No, I called the police but it's almost impossible to track. I had to chained to a steel post, but they cut the chain with bolt cutters I guess. I sure hate thieves.
<user0> Yeah, thieves are terrible.  I mean, who would steal a mower?
<user0> what did you do?
<user1> I called the manager over and they offered to redo the food and pay for it but I was so sicken and upset I said no thank you it ruined my whole appetite. 
<user0> yea i can see that, it happens but it sucks
<user0> well atleast you watch them with him! i dont like them either. 
<user1> We watched the new movie IT I was a little frightened and creep out especially because I'm afraid of clowns lol.
<user0> Oh no, no thank you! lol ahhh i cant even. 
<user0> That'll be tough.  Do you have anything you can do to keep busy?
<user1> Well, I might do some work on the house. But it's going to be awfully quiet around here.
<user0> I bet.  It's sometimes surprising how much your life revolves around the other person being in the house.
<user0> spray water over there
<user1> Ha, that's not a bad idea. I do need to have a word with him about it though at least.
<user0> thats good, you should
<user0> Could you get with your HR department to see if they can assist?
<user1> I might give that a try. But whoever did it had probably better hope that I don't find out who they are!
<user0> What would you do to them?
<user1> Well nothing too serious, but I'd definitely have a word or two with them!
<user1> Yea, I used to hate it too.
<user0> I get so worried about something happening to me.
<user1> Like a paranormal type fear or a human with intent to harm type fear?
<user0> More of a human with intent to harm type fear.
<user0> is it really hard? or you just have not have that much time to paly
<user1> It's pretty tough. But it doesn't matter now... I let a friend of mine have a try, and he got through it right away! It was pretty impressive to see.
<user0> yeah some people are just naturaly good at video games
<user0> That's pretty impressive, does he have any training or just all self taught?
<user1> A little bit of both!  I didn't know he had these skills but it was really neat to watch!
<user0> Well it's certainly nice to have someone around with handy knowledge like that!
<user0> That is frustrating!  We have a couple down the street that raises hunting dogs.  So annoying all day!
<user1> It really is. And I've talked to him a few times about it, but he doesn't seem to care at all.
<user0> I am sure he thinks it's his world, the rules dont apply to him.  Sorry you have to deal with that people can be so rude
<user0> Well you must be happy about it.
<user1> Not really... I'm the one that turned him in. And I'm scared that he might know about that.
<user0> Oh! that is bad then.  Be careful.
<user0> I hope you hear good news.
<user1> I think I will. It's been 7 years since my last treatment. I still get nervous when I have my checkups though.
<user0> I understand. I guess you'll always feel that way.
<user0> It was nice of you to buy him food, but I'm thinking he didn't pay you back.
<user1> Nope, I've been waiting for a few days, and I could really use that money now.
<user0> I'm sorry. I know it sucks to need money and be counting on it, and then you don't get it. I hope he pays you back soon.
<user0> Ugh! I use to have the same problem with my neighbors dog who would poop in my driveway! At least it was my tires and not my feet that got the unpleasant surprise.
<user1> Yeah.... the smell was so bad. It took forever to get that off of my shoe.
<user0> Does this happen often? I'd let my neighbor know about it.
<user0> That's great! You must have been so surprised and pleased to hear from them.
<user1> I was! It was so great hearing from her again.
<user0> I bet you had tons of catching up to do!
<user0> The way you wrote that makes it seem like you're anticipating something bad... Do you mind if I ask what you're expecting to happen?
<user1> See, that's the thing... I have no idea what to expect. That's why I'm so nervous about it.
<user0> Interesting... well then at least that leaves the possibility for something good instead. If you're not sure what it could be, then at least it's not some obvious mistake or negligence on your part. I hope for the best for you
<user0> That is unfortunate, my own mother was ill for several years, she is getting older as well. Do you get to see her often?
<user1> Yeah, I try to go see her at least twice a week. I'm not sure how much longer she'll be with us.
<user0> Just spend what time you can with her, I'd like to say something really profound but aging parents is a situation that just sucks. Sorry you are having to deal with it.
<user0> That was great of him!
<user1> It was. I insisted that I pay him after I got a job but he wouldn't take the money.
<user0> He sounds very nice!
<user0> Oh really what was the assignment
<user1> It was a presentation that had to be quickly put together.  My supervisor seemed pleased
<user0> It's always great to get back positive feedback!
<user0> What was it like when it showed up on your door?
<user1> I was watching the front door like a hawk, and constantly checking for online tracking updates.  I kept worrying that someone would steal it of my porch if I didn't get it right away.
<user0> Thats hilarious, You finally got it though uhuh?
<user1> Oh yeah.  As soon as I heard the knock I flung the door open and snatched it in a hurry.
<user1> Im sure they had a good excuse.
<user0> He said he was busy with work, so I suppose so
<user1> Oh I see. Hopefully its just that one time where he couldnt get to his phone to let you know.
<user1> Oh crap! how long untill you realized?
<user0> A few minutes after leaving, I was able to get it back
<user1> Thats so good, man I have done that a time of two.
<user1> I am sure you will as well. Confidence is great!
<user0> Thank you. I'm almost done with school!
<user1> Congratulations. You have done great!
<user1> That's really cool. What kind of car?
<user0> BMW, it was a model I had been looking to get myself 
<user1> That  sounds like a really awesome car!
<user1> Aww, that's really sweet and sentimental. I like that. Can you still read the words on it?
<user0> The edges are a little frayed but I can still make out everything on it.  I keep it in a zippered compartment to preserve it.  Maybe I'll frame it someday.
<user1> I was going to say, yeah, that's the kind of thing I would love to preserve in a frame or something for my office. How cool!
<user0> Yeah, it's a nice little souvenir to remind me of good times.  It was a great concert and experience for all of us.
<user1> Who did you go see? And are you still friends with all the same people? I wonder if any of them kept their ticket stubs too.
<user0> We went to see Incubus, it was our favorite band going through high school.  I went with my best friends who I'm still best friends with, and they actually did keep theirs too. 
<user0> that stinks. what did you do?
<user1> Yeah! Well I was in a parking garage so I went walking to try and find someone to borrow a pen from
<user0> and did you find one?
<user1> I did, this really nice woman just gave me a very fancy one. She told me to keep it!
<user0> oh that is awesome. and you got a fancy pen out of it
<user0> Did it went well?
<user1> Yeah it went really well actually, the result was better than I had hoped for in fact!
<user0> That is great. What was the issue with your ear?
<user1> Thanks! I had a bone that had fused inside my ear and made me deaf, and they replaced it with a titanium piston!
<user1> you made quick work out of that
<user0> Yeah, I was really happy that the unloading took as little time as it did.
<user1> i wish i could unload that fast
<user1> oh goodness. that has happened to me before. i could not sleep
<user0> It was a brown recluse. I had no clue that I had poisonous spiders at my house.
<user1> how in the world did it get in your house? were you able to kill it?
<user1> OOOOOOOOOO NICE!
<user0> Yeah, I'm excited.  First girlfriend that I've lived with but she is pretty awesome so I'm glad it finally happened.
<user1> Well you two have fun tonight.  I won't tell your parents about all this.
<user1> Why you need to thank her? Is she the one that helped you to find the new job?
<user0> She was a great influence and gave me words of encouragement to branch out and go for more then our company job.
<user1> She is very nice person. That is great.
<user1> Oh. Will he be starting elementary school?
<user0> Yes, he will be starting Kindergarten this year.
<user1> aw he's at that precious age where you have to let his hand go, hu?
<user1> Damn why'd you have to tell me that...Gawd that's freakin sad, jeezus
<user0> I am soo upset, and worse I have to tell the kids when they get home.
<user1> I wish you and your fam peace happiness love and good health.
<user1> What? Do you have evidence supporting this
<user0> I sure do I have it on video and made a report with the police already.
<user1> Good hope that bitch goes to hell...sorry I love animals and my mom's dog died the same way
<user1> That is a big deal.  What are you going to do?
<user0> I have tried everything, but they keep doing it even after paying huge fines.
<user1> I would throw trash in their yard.
<user1> He sounds like a real hero though. I hope he comes home safe soon
<user0> Thank you, The kids and I miss him terribly. 
<user1> I can only imagine. At least you have each other 
<user1> Are you and your family okay?
<user0> We are thank heavens, but we lost everything. 
<user1> I am sorry, you can replace it though
<user1> Wow!  How kind is that!  Their really are kind people left in this world.  How did you respond?
<user0> Yes, and I am thankful for those kind of people.
<user1> *There* oops.  Did you ever find out her name?  Or find out a way to thank her?
<user1> On no! Did you have to walk, or did you call for service?
<user0> A nice man stopped, help me push my car to the shoulder and even had a can of gas he let me use in his trunk. Talk about a nice guy.
<user1> Wow, you got lucky! Did you give him a tip?
<user1> Why did you feel you had to cheat? I am sure you could have passed if you had studied.
<user0> I just wanted to make sure I passed. But now I have a big 0.
<user1> Well, don't let this one situation define you. Use it as a learning experience and move on, and do you best not to repeat it.
<user1> That's so sad! What on earth happened?
<user0> I accidentally peed my pants when I was laughing. 
<user1> Now that is quite embarrassing! What did your co-workers say?
<user0> They all laughed and posted it on facebook.
<user0> That is wonderful!  She must be so proud of herself and I know you are proud of her.  Its great that she likes learning so much.
<user1> Yes I agree. I let her choose our vacation this summer. She cried because she was so happy.
<user0> Awww, what a great idea!  That's so cute! Where are you guys going?
<user0> You are such a good person to do that!
<user1> Thank you! They say they feel like they are the kids and it makes them feel young again.
<user0> It's crazy how the tables turn!
<user0> Why do you say that
<user1> It was raining today, and when I walked into the store I slipped and fell right on my face.
<user0> Oh no, were you okay
<user0> Oh my goodness, what happened? Did they find out you owe money to the local crime families? Those bank employees need to mind their own business, am I right!?
<user1> How did you guess? You are exactly right. Now they are talking about alerting the police!
<user0> That is absolutely unacceptable. Snitches get stitches, that's what I say. Tell me where they're at and I'll roll up on 'em and tell 'em what for. Just say the word. I've got your back.
<user0> have you asked your friends for family?
<user1> No one is available. She asked someone that I don't know and they are coming. I am a little uneasy.
<user0> i would def feel that way.its hard when you dont know the person or can trust them
<user1> I guess I just have to hope for the best and hope I don't get robbed or worse.
<user1> Oh yeah? And what news might that be?
<user0> My husband just signed with the NFL. I never knew he was that good!
<user1> Nice! Did he sign up to be a waterboy?
<user1> Oh my goodness, that's terrible!
<user0> I am soo mad. I can't believe he did this after being married for 15 years.
<user1> What do you plan on doing?
<user1> uh oh. did something happen?
<user0> Yes, I was robbed at gun point while walking home from work.
<user1> That must be traumatizing. Most people wouldn't want to go out alone after that. It's understandable.
<user1> Do you think you will get the job?
<user0> Not sure, but I really need this job to support my kids.
<user1> I hope you end up getting it!
<user1> Oh definitely, Youtube is a great platform for these talented people
<user0> Yeah, it never ceases to amaze me the kinds of things you can see on YouTube.  Endless content to discover.
<user1> Yeah, my favorite is watching short comedy videos of my favorite drag queens
<user0> I like to watch either acoustic guitar covers or vocal covers.  Makes me jealous I don't have the skills to do the same.
<user0> do you think there something wrong
<user1> They think I may have brain cancer. I can't seem to even sit still waiting for that phone call.
<user0> oh no thats terrible Im sorry to hear that
<user0> Me too! I bought about a thousand dollars worth of tickets last night!
<user1> Wow. I spent $500.00 myself. I hope it pays off!
<user0> You and I both! No matter who wins, let's promise to split the pot.
<user0> Oh nice, where are you going?
<user1> I will be going on my first cruise. 
<user0> Wow, I've never been on a cruise before. I think it sounds like a lot of fun
<user0> Why? What did she do?
<user1> She helped us pay off our house so it didn't go into foreclosure. 
<user0> She is a special woman.
<user0> I would be downright furious. Start by smacking him across the face randomly at dinner. That should be a good segway into the conversation.
<user1> That is how I feel. I don't think he understands how it makes me feel inside. 
<user0> Oh, he certainly will when he feels the hot, guilty tears running down his face from that strong, independent, jealous filled slap!
<user0> Was any of your stuff damaged?
<user1> Yes, our whole house was swept out to sea.
<user0> Oh wow! I am sorry to hear that. Maybe you can go find it and sail it to go kill Moby Dick to make up for the damages.
<user0> Exciting! Are you moving to a new company?
<user1> No, this is the first job I have ever had just out of high school.
<user0> Oh fun! I'm so excited for you. Try to learn as much as possible from this job and ask for career development opportunities!
<user0> Oh geez! What on earth was it!
<user1> I saw a guy pick a piece of chewed gum off the sidewalk and put it in his mouth.
<user0> That is FRIGGIN revolting!!! I would have lost my lunch right then and there!
<user0> No way. What happened? If honestly, almost all my days are like this. So, worst has become normal for me
<user1> That is so sad. I was turned down for my promotion at work to someone with less experience than me. 
<user0> Don't get it personally. Good performance will always catch other's attention. Just continue doing your work
<user0> That's awesome! Always good to be content with life.
<user1> It took a long time. But I always tell people to plan for the future! 
<user0> It's good to be prepared for anything because you never know what could happen.
<user0> Definately! I have one daughter and twins on the way... I foresee love overload. How many do you have?
<user1> Congrats. I love every bit of motherhood. I have 3 kids. They are 7,5, and 2
<user0> Thanks, Motherhood truly is amazing
<user0> Not really, do you?
<user1> Some time I felt disgusted with my work
<user0> Oh I'm so sorry to hear that, i hope it picks up for you, maybe listen to a little music to lift your spirits
<user1> Yes I love to hear music
<user1> Oof, sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do I guess
<user0> I felt so bad I brought them back. I am happy I wasn't arrested. But it was only half a pack I brought back.
<user1> Well you tried to make things right, you're still a good person
<user1> i can say that i am satisfied with where i am what i do and what its done for me. are you?
<user0> Great! I am very happy with work, I am loving it
<user1> im glad to hear that!
<user0> Thank you so much
<user0> What are you packing extra clothes for? Did you go somewhere did something happen?
<user1> We went on vacation. And we all ended up with the stomach virus so you can guess from there lol
<user0> What are you packing extra clothes for? Did you go somewhere did something happen?
<user0> What concert is it? Are you excited to go?
<user1> Super excited to see Taylor Swift! He knew I was a fan.
<user0> OH MY GOD, I'm so jealous, she isn't coming to my city this time. You're gonna have a great time
<user0> Wow, that will be a busy house
<user1> Yes, I agree. I was super worried, but decided to think more positive and I know I will be able to handle it.
<user0> That's a great attitude, I hope you and your family stay happy and healthy
<user0> What did you lie about, are you going to tell him?
<user1> I might as well since I feel so bad. I pretended to be sick because I didn't want to spend 3 days at my in law's house this holiday weekend.
<user0> HAHAHA if anything that is excusable, noone like inlaws!
<user0> How scary! I'm terrified thinking a tornado could pass by here
<user1> It's so much worse when the power is out and all we have is a few candles and flashlights.
<user0> Well I hope nothing crazy happens and you guys stay safe!
<user0> Wow, that's very nice of him! Was there a lot of people there?
<user1> Yes almost my entire family! The only one that wasn't there was my son. He couldn't come because he had to work.
<user0> That's too bad. I hope you had a blast!
<user1> I did! We had pizza, cake, chips, all kinds of goodies that I love.
<user1> That's a good idea! It's always smart to be on the safe side.
<user0> We usually don't have horrible storms so i never do it, but i have heard this one is going to be a bad one.  i just want to be ready
<user1> I've done that as well where nothing ends up happening but I bought all this stuff. You never know what could happen though.
<user1> Where are you going on vacation?
<user0> My husband and i are going to the smokeys.  I have been but he hasn't. 
<user1> That should be fun, what do you plan to do there?
<user1> That must of been horrible.
<user0> I can't stop thinking about it.  I keep replaying the scene in my head, it was so bad.
<user1> I am sure people forgot already.
<user1> What job is it?
<user0> i will be working at a daycare. i love kids, but i am not sure i will like working with so many at once.
<user1> Only one way to find out.
<user1> What branch of the military then?
<user0> The marines. He has always wanted to join.  I am glad he is finally getting to. 
<user1> The marines is by far my favorite so good for him!
<user1> Oh no that's horrible. Have you complained to the electric company?
<user0> Yes but i always get the same answer, we are working to improve the infrastructure.. blah blah. I am seriously considering solar.
<user1> I would too at this point. It might be more reliable.
<user1> That will be no fun.
<user0> No.  I hope it isn't a murder trial or something heartbreaking.
<user1> Don't you have to be selected first?
<user1> That sucks! i hate losing money as well. 
<user0> Yes, I swear there were 5 people sitting all around me that won several games.  It's just not fair.
<user1> That's how I always feel at those things as well!
<user1> I do enjoy the zoo and the animals. I think they could be just as good.
<user0> Yes, I am happy somebody shares this with me.
<user1> I think it's a good outlook.
<user1> Hopefully one day you might decide to choose otherwise or have a child of your own.
<user0> I don't know if this is something I'll ever be ready for.
<user1> It's a tough choice to make, and not everyone has to raise a child.
<user1> i can say that i have mistaken something for what it isnt. but not sure about the ready for anything
<user0> It's just that the other day I mistaken a guard for a tour guide and almost got in a fight.
<user1> almost? so the situation resolved itself?
<user1> What kind of interview?
<user0> An interview for a job.
<user1> Really? That is cool
<user1> How exactly?
<user0> well i came back from work kind of sad because i thought nobody remembered my birthday and as soon as i went inside they screamed happy birthday , not gonna lie i got really happy.
<user1> I bet you needed help to take all the presents back home.
<user1> oh my god, how did you get out of there?
<user0> I realized I could walk very fast if I want to.
<user1> that sounds great.
<user1> That's a great asset to have emotionally I think.
<user0> I agree, although I don't really know if you can train yourself to be like that.
<user1> Yeah it might just be something you're born with.
<user1> I agree. Music used to have soul and good lyrics back in the day.
<user0> Yes, today it's just all about money and getting physical.
<user1> Hopefully music nowadays can take a note from the good old days and change their tune.
<user1> how did that go? did it bring back a lot of memories?
<user0> it did, so much nostalgia!
<user1> im glad to hear that. sounds like a great trip
<user1> Almost sounds like the erratic weather that we have here in Georgia.  I don't mind the rain as long as I'm inside.  The sun is beautiful but sometimes it can be brutal when it starts to heat up.  Do you prefer sunny days?
<user0> Sun is what makes me alive, so definitely yes.
<user1> I have to be very careful in the sun.  My allergies and the sun don't mix too well.  I can tolerate the rain much better.  I love the sound of water.
<user1> i can agree with that. i do feel the effects of age creeping up on me though
<user0> Yes, but this part is inevitable, for now let us enjoy our young years.
<user1> def. make the best of them
<user1> It's good to explore your own interests and what makes you grow on your own.
<user0> Yes, I still think that there are good and bad sides in both of these cases.
<user1> Hopefully one day you will be willing to explore a relationship in a serious way.
<user1> I once volunteered to pick up trash on the side of the road. It's amazing how much people litter
<user0> Good for you, instead of tickets this should be a punishment for everyone.
<user1> I wish. People might have more respect if they were forced to clean up other people's trash as well.
<user1> Are you in a dangerous place?
<user0> No I'm not, but in away we all are in a very dangerous place, aren't we?
<user1> I suppose so. It's great that you value life so much!
<user1> Oh no. Did it get ruined?
<user0> i got so embarrassed but thankfully it didn't get ruined
<user1> Close call. I once spilt tea over my laptop and the keys were all sticky for a while
<user1> Really? So sorry for the lose
<user0> i'm really sad because she used to help me with everything 
<user1> Was she sick?
<user0> yeah. heart problems
<user0> That's a bummer. It's never fun to not win.
<user1> No it isn't. I felt like I put a lot of effort into it too.
<user0> Hopefully you'll have better luck next time!
<user0> That's not good, we ended up lucky with who we have 
<user1> i wish we did too.. but it's okay 
<user0> Maybe you can find another one or go back to your previous company. Have you double checked with the company to make sure everything is ok? 
<user1> i haven't , i guess i'll do it later today
<user1> that's wonderful! I hope you will get that promotion! What do you do?
<user0> I am a electrical engineer with more than 15 years experience. I have a really good feeling that I am going to get this job.
<user1> Good luck! Whenever you get that promotion we should go celebrate
<user1> I agree, plus I love making snowmen! 
<user0> snowmen are my favourite! 
<user1> I always get sad though when they melt 
<user1> Ouch! Did they try to help you back up?
<user0> Yeah, my coworker did, but the damage had already been done. Pretty big shot to the ego to look like such a fool in front of your client.
<user1> Of course! Well, at least you also looked human. We all make mistakes.
<user1> That sounds really scary!  Is your son afraid or is he use to it?
<user0> He is only three, so it is pretty scary for him each time. I hate to see him that way.
<user1> I would hate that as well. I hope he learns to cope with it.
<user1> That is a lot of extra money to spen, but it is completely understandable it you are that nervous about it.  Have you ever looked into calming medications, or meditation to help your nerves?
<user0> I have, but they only cut down the anxiety instead of making it go away completely. Something about hurdling towards earth at a rapid pace in a large metal box alarms me.
<user1> I completely understand that.  My mother in law used to have really bad anxiety about flying, but she did hypnosis and it really helped. 
<user1> Wow. That's intense. Did your home get any damage?
<user0> No, I move away from there some years ago, but I hate seeing the place I grew up basically destroyed now.
<user1> Yeah. I feel for you. It hurts to lose things like that.
<user1> That is awesome.  Happy Birthday!  What kind is it?
<user0> It's a Dell with a I7 and 8 gigs of ram, even has a Nvidia graphics card. She pretty much know what I wanted.
<user1> Is that a gaming computer?
<user1> Sorry to hear about that. Are the damages covered by an insurance?
<user0> Yes, we had insurance that is going to cover it, but it still sucks start from ground zero. Plus, insurance can't really replace some things.
<user1> I understand. It is always difficult to start from ground zero. Good luck.
<user1> Interesting....did you do it
<user0> Yeah, but only because he was getting mad at me. I hate heights and I was very unsure about it.
<user1> lol why would he get mad...but did you have fun in the end
<user1> Why do you cheat on him?
<user0> I could have. But I didn't. He cheated on me actually.
<user1> Oh I see, why are you still with him then?
<user1> I know how you feel. Are you also spoiled by amazone prime?
<user0> Indeed, I thought everything came this early.
<user1> Haha, I know. Especially when I purchase firearms related things like ammunition. It has to ship ground.  1 week for shipping?!?!   rage.
<user0> That sucks! I guess ground shipping takes ages in large countries. 
<user1> Yeah, the US is huge, landmass wise.
<user0> I really really wished it would come today, I was even sat at the window looking for postal trucks and everything!
<user1> You can always leave them an angry review online
<user1> What did your dog do?
<user0> He saw the rabbit that lives under my shed eating some grass in my yard, and decided to scare it and chase it away.
<user1> Oh no, well at least he didnt hurt the rabbit.
<user0> You're right, it could have been much worse. I am thankful in a way.
<user0> What happened to you?
<user1> I accidentally can off the road avoiding a deer and totaled my new car.
<user0> That sucks sorry to hear. Are you okay?
<user0> Oh nice! I bet you'll remember that for a long time
<user1> Yes and I will it was great and her voice and the singers really moved me because even in person it was lovely. 
<user0> I've never been to a concert. I should go see one like you!
<user0> that's terrible! how does that make you feel?
<user1> It makes me feel old. I mean I am not that old, but to see people my age passing away really makes me think about my own mortality. 
<user0> That is the reality of life, unfortunately! That's what you have to enjoy life now.
<user0> That is terrible. How long have you had this pet?
<user1> She had it for 2 years. But I feel I must be honest with her.
<user0> Honesty is vey important. I hope she will not feel too bad.
<user0> Where are you going?
<user1> I am still shocked he planned a cruise for 7 days.
<user0> That is going to be so fun!
<user0> I am never ready. which diet are you trying
<user1> The keto diet and I have started looking up meal preps and workouts but as of non I am so not arranged to start this up I need more time.
<user0> I think my favorite and easiest would have to be Atkins but still alot of prep to get started
<user1> I have to look into that one never heard of it thanks.
<user0> your welcome, and I will check out Keto.
<user0> My kitties are my family too. Animals are the best.
<user1> Yes they are you can't be lonely with them they are just so warmhearted and loving always. 
<user0> Exactly! I am glad you have them
<user0> That sounds interesting.. What was it? And how did you find out? And why did he hide it! If you don't mind me asking, of course...
<user1> I happen to come across all his drawings. He is as good as most professional artists! 
<user0> Oh I see.. Well that's a pretty positive talent then, huh? Maybe you should encourage him to keep doing it. Maybe he misses it. You could get him a present for his birthday or Christmas that was related to drawing tools/pencils and all that.
<user0> how is that working out for you
<user1> A little rusty but I know when I get in the class and hit the floor with my shoes I am more then positive it will be great.
<user0> practice makes perfect
<user0> omg i would be upset too... how many times have you called them to fix it? 
<user1> Every month they shut off my service because I didn't pay the second bill. Then I have to go all over this month after month of them fixing their errors.
<user0> Sounds like a nightmare! total. 
<user0> Does it make you feel happy about your life since then?
<user1> Yeah, just makes me think back to those times and how it was so different from now.
<user0> Well at least you'll always have your memories as time goes on.
<user0> that's why i don't watch sports lol we always make fun of our uncle because he talks a lot of smack and die hard Redskins fan
<user1> I love the Jaguars I was ashamed I talk a lot of smack to everyone lol I guess me and your uncle need to stay quite next time lol.
<user0> lol no! you shouldn't! that's the best part! Talking smack to each other
<user1> You're right I'm going to be even louder next time.
<user1> Oh I know how you feel! I wish there was some kind of hotline where you could report a license plate to law enforcement so they would get in trouble for being stupid with kids around
<user0> I wish to and the school zone light was flashing but they was driving past the 15 mph minimum a child could have got hurt.
<user1> Thats awful! People should be arrested for that
<user1> Oh no!  Devastating! I'm so sorry.
<user0> I know it is I lost $100 and was actually on the way to pay my car insurance with that can't believe I was careless. 
<user1> That makes me feel ill so I'm sure you were sick. I hope somehow you make it up!
<user1> That could turn out expensive. Did they need a particular brand for a particular reason?
<user0> I'm not sure, it was just on the list.  I had a really hard time finding them.
<user1> That's annoying, maybe they should provide links for you next time?
<user1> How did it go?
<user0> I think it went well, apart from a few mistakes, hopefully I got the job.
<user1> That is great.  Interviews are very intimidating. 
<user1> Oh no, what happened?
<user0> They made a mess everywhere in the house. Really was not a good way to earn money.
<user1> There has o be an easier way.  I have always avoided babysitting because I just don't like other peoples kids that much.
<user0> Yeah, kids are super annoying to deal with, I've learned a lesson, ha!
<user0> So i am guessing she gave you a good surprise?
<user1> An awesome one! All my best friends were there and I got some pretty sweet gifts!
<user0> She's must be a keeper then.
<user1> I definitely think so!
<user1> That is awesome.  I have never won anything in my life.  What festival was it?
<user0> That's a shame! It was a festival called Pooza Fest. Many punk-rock and acoustic shows!
<user1> Congratulations!  Did you have a good time?
<user0> I did, thanks for asking. I went with my older brother and a few of his friends. It was a blast!
<user0> wow thats awesome.  How did you win them? I never win anything cool.
<user1> I won them by sharing and liking a facebook page! Unfortunately, none of my friends could go and so I ended up staying home instead.
<user0> aww that stinks, i hope you were at least able to sell them and make some money
<user1> They were tied to my name, so I couldn't even sell them. Oh well!
<user1> That is crazy! How is he still employed?
<user0> He went on disability.  He actually was my old roommate so I know he just doesnt like working but at the same time has anxiety issues so he can go that route to not get fired.  It definitely doesnt look good for him though.
<user1> That makes people look bad. I have severe anxiety and still go to work. I get that things are hard but.... its bad to never come in.
<user1> I am glad that you spoke out and shared your feelings. Its not healthy to self harm and pent up your feelings.
<user0> Agreed. I was anxious and scared to share, but I'm glad I did; they were really supportive and it's helped me a lot.
<user1> Thats what best friends are for, after all. I hope things have gotten better for you.
<user0> They have, ever since I started taking meds and speaking to my doctor and social worker. This is also the reason why I think you should confide in a professional, it can really turn your life around and you deserve the best!
<user0> Gesh, that's frustrating. I had a dog that used to do that too. Had to get a trash can with a lid.
<user1> That's a good idea, I just haven't found a nice looking one yet. It's really frustrating but I think I'll just get whatever I can at this point.
<user0> We even had to put something heavy on top of the lid to keep it from getting in it. Hopefully that will work for now until you figure something out.
<user1> Thanks for the suggestions, I'm going to give them a shot!
<user1> That is awe inspiring, very patriotic.  Did you get pictures?
<user0> I did. Not the best pictures because I was using my phone but still, it was really surprising.
<user1> I'm sure, that isn't something you see every day, or would even expect to see ever.  I'm glad you got it documented.
<user1> Well, that's great. But you probably should study as well. School is very important.
<user0> Yeah... I'm pretty upset in myself for procrastinating, but also proud of what I've been accomplishing. I'm so conflicted in my emotions.
<user1> Yeah, that does sound like a conflicting situation. Well at least you're doing something positive.
<user1> I bought a lite brite from goodwill about a year ago. It was one of the remakes from recent years but we had fun with it.
<user0> His is a new version too...those toys that were older were sooo much better but at least kids today can have an idea of how awesome they were back then!
<user1> Nope, they only know how to touch screens.
<user1> That's great! How long have you two been together?
<user0> Almost a year.  We're a little bit older though so I dont feel like its a rush into a relationship sort of thing.
<user1> You learn a lot about someone when you move in with them, so if you feel comfortable in your relationship I think that's actually rather prudent.
<user1> Oh I'll bet that didn't smell pleasant.
<user0> You got that right. Also there were so many fruit flies around it, I felt sick to my stomach.
<user1> Oh gross.  I hope she won't do that again.
<user1> Moving is the worst.  All those boxes.  ugh. i hope i dont have to do it for awhile
<user0> Haha, the boxes are still being unpacked and probably will be for the next couple weeks.  I'm hoping we dont have to again for a while!
<user1> I hope its good that she moved in with you.  things must be serious
<user1> That sounds pretty amazing, what convention was it?
<user0> Otakuthon 2018. It was so amazing, I ended up doing really great!
<user1> I'm so happy for you, it sounds like it was a wonderful opportunity!
<user1> That is always so much fun. Which ones made you feel the most nostalgic?
<user0> the one where i was eating ice cream, oh god i miss eating ice cream
<user1> I know how you feel. I feel guilty about indulging in ice cream the older I get.
<user1> oh yea? and what did they get you?
<user0> I got an Xbox One, and I had no idea how much fun I'd have until I received it.
<user1> Oh nice.  Those are fun.  I love playing video games
<user1> Oh yes? What happened?
<user0> I was running on a road with a sidewalk, I turned the corner and saw a deer staring at me. Can't believe I found one in my small suburban neighborhood.
<user1> Oh, that must have been so precious! We had deer around where I used to live - they're gorgeous creatures.
<user1> That's not much fun. Did he get a new one recently?
<user0> Kind of. I built myself a new PC, and gave him my previous one. I re-built it for him and made sure everything would work perfectly!
<user1> Wow, you're smart and kind! I wouldn't know where to start re. building a computer. Well done!
<user0> Thanks! Seeing him smile as he played with high frame rates and nice graphics brought me such joy. 
<user1> What a nice thing to do. You seem to get on very well with your little bro.
<user0> I love my siblings so much, they're the best.
<user1> I love my brother, too. He's a great guy. How lucky we are!
<user1> Do you know it was her for sure? That is horrible that you cant trust your own sister.
<user0> Yeah, no one else in the household would ever do something like that. The worst thing is, my parents did nothing about it.
<user1> That is horrible. It sucks that you have to keep such a close eye on your things in front of family. I would be so mad.
<user1> I hear you! That sounds almost worse then a nightmare as it sounds like it's stuff you miss!
<user0> Yeah, but at the same time, it motivated me for the day which was nice
<user1> Thats great! What kind of stuff was in the dreams?
<user0> to keep on dreaming and follow my heart, in other words, me chasing after what i love
<user0> That has got to be one of the best feelings. I love being complimented.
<user1> Yes, it is great to see something you designed be put into a working model. 
<user0> You should be proud of yourself. Keep pushing it and work and it will all pay off.
<user0> Dont put too much weight into those advertisements. Sometimes they are just there to get a rise out of you.
<user1> yeah, but i wish it wasn't like this
<user0> I know that feeling. Sometimes they can really get under your skin.
<user0> Thats nice to hear. Hopefully it makes you two happy. I would just unpack the necessities first and move from there.
<user1> I think thats the plan.  After those were just slowly going to go from room to room until everything is done.  Not a huge rush and were both super happy...well I am.  I'm assuming she is too!
<user0> Sounds like a plan! Make sure to hydrate properly because unpacking is cumbersome work!
<user0> That would be a great feeling.  Did something happen to make you feel more content?
<user1> yes, i just realised i have everything i ever wanted in my life
<user0> Thats so awesome! Congrats! I am hoping to get there soon.  I have a lot to be thankful for but I know I need to work on just a little bit before I am fully content.
<user0> oh nice! i know that feeling, is it home? what made you think about going there?
<user1> It isnt home but I went there for family trips when I was younger. My girlfriends friend is having a baby shower and lives there so I'm tagging along and were going to make a long weekend out of it!
<user0> nice! hope you enjoy your weekend and make sure to make the most out of it!
<user0> yeah it can be akward some times specially if you dont know what to talk about
<user1> yeah, so i tried to look for a way out before i admit defeat, but then i realised there was no way out and so i talked to them in the end
<user0> yeah a little chat to an old friend cannot hurt did you enjoy the conversation?
<user1> yeah it wasn't bad in the end, just awkward 
<user0> well im glad it did not go in the wrong direction
<user0> Do you think they deserved it?
<user1> No, their performance seemed to be good
<user0> Well as they say, "Better them than you"
<user0> that is wonderful it is good to hear you guys are doing good progress
<user1> thank you, in a few months everything will work out perfectly
<user0> that is good hard work and determination will always pay off
<user0> thats a really good feeling isnt it? anything in particular?
<user1> just how i have everything i ever wanted, and that made me feel very grateful 
<user0> Thats awesome.  Im glad youre happy.  keep the positive energy flowing
<user0> Im guessing it wasnt your fault? Do you know whos it was?
<user1> I wasn't even at work the day it happened, yet they still insist it was me.
<user0> That sounds like sabotage to me. Is there any way to prove you werent there? I would be furious.
<user1> I guess I can get them to check their logs.
<user1> Did they not ever come?
<user0> No one came to visit.
<user1> Man that's a bummer.  I'd visit you but that would be weird.
<user0> Just a little, but I feel so lonely it might be worth it.
<user0> That is awesome.  What kind of designs are there?
<user1> a rabbit near her and a owl near my side of the bed and random marks everywhere else
<user0> That is very very cool.  I would love something like that in mine
<user0> Its always nice getting praise and compliments.  I hope everyone was proud of you
<user1> they are, and i am very proud of myself
<user0> Thats great.  I hope you get a raise too
<user0> Like what?
<user1> I took him to the vet who checked it over and determined he was bit.  They suggested benedryl and rest for a couple days until it went down.
<user0> Wow that's really compassionate of you
<user0> Are you feeling much more motivated now? What do you want to achieve?
<user1> i am feeling motivated, i want to be financially free and continue to learn and develop myself even more
<user0> Thats such fantastic goals to aim for in life! I wish you all the best. 
<user0> Happy Birthday.  That was so nice of them.  I bet you were surprised.  Was there cake?
<user1> Oh yeah, the surprise was the cake being thrown in my face!
<user0> haha that sounds quite messy, but I hope that it atleast tasted good
<user0> I agree, you need money for everything these days and it controls us.
<user1> yeah i will continue to work hard on my finance and make sure it doesn't control me
<user0> Me too, I try not to worry about money so much. There's more to life than that.
<user0> I hope your work continues on the path you want and expect.
<user1> thank you and i hope you do so too, let's work hard!
<user0> Hard work is supposed to payoff, right?
<user1> yup
<user1> I know how that feels and it can make you sick very fast. Do whatever you can to try and get enough sleep.
<user0> i know i should, but it's been very rough recently with work and all
<user1> If you get sick you won't be able to work at all so please take care of yourself.
<user1> What happened?
<user0> as usual i decided to listen to my father, he told me to come back to my home city and said he has a job there, so i could quit mine, but when i went there he lied, and now i don't have a job
<user1> Wow, that's cruel.
<user1> Yeah that is a pretty good mindset to go by.
<user0> thank you, i hope it goes well for you too
<user1> Just keep it up and you will go far.
<user1> that is great! I'm also learning to write code.
<user0> oh really? what language on?
<user1> HTML/CSS/Java. I'm excited about a career change.
<user1> why is that?
<user0> Not sure if everyone who RSVP'd would show up. People are so flaky these days.
<user1> oh god yes i know what you mean, any ideas what you wanna do ?
<user1> uhoh, did you get lost?
<user0> No, it just took me somewhere dodgy.
<user1> oh that is scary.  I hope you were ok.  make sure your doors are locked
<user0> Good idea, I won't be stumbling down that dark alleyway again!
<user0> what was wrong with it
<user1> Engine issues, I'm praying it will last a bit longer now
<user0> good luck! we just had our mini cooper blow its engine yesterday .. $12.5k to replace 
<user0> Well music does have a really cathartic effect on people.
<user1> yup, it's also a digital drug 
<user0> He can have a great impact on your brain and feeling that is for sure
<user0> Wow!  That's a horrible prank!  I would be crying!  What did you do when your friend gave it back?
<user1> i punched him, i was so mad and furious 
<user0> I would have been really mad as well!  Hopefully he learned not to pull that kind of prank on you again!
<user0> I'm sorry to hear that. Do you mind if I ask what happened today to make it so weird?
<user1> it's not a bad feeling so dont be sorry, it happens every now and then, just makes me realise how grateful i am to be alive
<user0> Oh, I see. I think I kind of understand. It at least sounds like you're a really self-aware person, and appreciative of the small things, and that you have decent perspective on things. The emotions might be difficult to deal with, but at least there are some positives there for you to take stock of
<user0> thats crazy. and scary.  WHat happened?
<user1> Crashed the car, totalled it too.
<user0> im so sorry.  I hope youre ok
<user1> I am, but I have to pay out to fix the car!
<user1> Getting paid is always a good thing. Were you waiting to get something special?
<user0> My boss said there might be the possibility of a raise this month.
<user1> You deserve one. Did you get it?
<user0> That's why I'm waiting on it, but I believe that he might have given me it!
<user0> I hate it when that happens! Were they driving fast at the time, it could have been quite dangerous.
<user1> Not too fast, it was still irritating though
<user0> I can imagine, at least you got out of the situation safely
<user0> That's awesome. I think it's great that you stepped up to repay your loans!
<user1> Yes, I'm so thankful it's done. It has taken me 15 years. Now only 15 more for my wife's loans
<user0> Oh man, well I hope that it was worth it to take out those loans.
<user0> That is such a long time to live in loneliness. I suggest you do, dogs are great companions
<user1> I was thinking I'll go to resume and adopt who ever has been their the longest.
<user0> Sounds like a great idea! That would be very nice of you to give a dog a home
<user0> Wow, congratulations!!  Are you guys excited?
<user1> Excited and Terrified 
<user0> I know the feeling!  My son is a year old so I remember it well haha.
<user0> You get a new trim?
<user1> I went old school. Last a bet now I have a mullet with lighting bolts on the side and a stash.
<user0> That's awesome, bet you look straight out of 1990s.
<user0> What did you guys get up to?
<user1> We just talked about the way things used to be
<user0> What do you miss the most?
<user0> that is awesome. what did he make you?
<user1> Bacon egg and cheese on toast! It was amazing! He makes the best fried eggs.
<user0> that sounds yummy. i'm glad you had that special treat.
<user0> Do you know what kind of dog?
<user1> Miniature Pinscher!
<user0> Those things can really fly on the ground.
<user0> Oh no! I bet she was mad as heck
<user1> Actually, she wasn't. She knew I was drunk, and she had been talking about involving another partner in the bedroom.
<user0> Oh hey! If it works out for you have fun
<user0> Gross! Out of all the bugs that I find in my house, those would be the worse.
<user1> I know! I feel like I need to bomb my house!!!
<user0> Knowing roaches, they'd probably survive it, seeing as they can pretty much survive anything!
<user0> Oh no! Did he pass?
<user1> He did and I'm so happy for him!
<user0> That's great!! Hopefully he will do good in school this year and not have to go to summer school again!
<user0> That's great. Maybe a promotion or a raise in on the horizon?
<user1> I'm hoping for both! but I'll take just the raise!!
<user0> Well I hope that it goes well for you!
<user1> Thank you!
<user1> Nice! I hope you get this job if you worked hard for it
<user0> I have and thanks so much I know I got this I'm positive of that all my hard work will pay off and I'm going to do great on Monday for the interview.
<user1> Just have faith in your abilities and the rest will come by itself
<user1> I'm sure its always fun to view the progress of your creations.
<user0> It is and me and my family got to see those great creation this weekend she made us a fabulous dinner. 
<user1> That sounds nice, having someone prepare a meal for you can be fun.
<user1> oh yea.. whats happened since then
<user0> Not much really, we just had a small chat, but it just felt really satisfying.
<user1> oh well that sounds pleasant
<user1> Did it feel good to get back out?
<user0> It felt amazing, I'm so happy I was able to push myself onto the right track.
<user1> How far did you end up running tonight?
<user0> Only 1.13 km in about 6 and a half minutes, which is terrible but I used to run nightly about three years ago. I averaged 5 mins per kilometer, and I know I can get back into shape!
<user0> How did you do?
<user1> I was so stun to see I only missed 7 out of 200 I was so happy to have aced my test.
<user0> Oh wow! Congrats! That's great!
<user0> It is it's something we all have as humans it's not defined by gender show off your emotions proud.
<user1> Yes, and it's a good news for us all.
<user0> It really is why would someone make you feel like it was for girls only especially being young but you are great now.
<user0> He should be ashamed for himself, did he say why he did it?
<user1> No we haven't seen him or he won't return none of the family calls he took our $500 and disappeared, 
<user0> Well, on the other hand you can think of this situation, as if you just paid $500 to a person to never bother you again.
<user0> Have you hugged him recently?
<user1> No he has been gone for 5 months now I can't wait to hug him though so for now I sleep in his shirts it seems like the closet I can get and it is so dear to me to wear it.
<user0> I'm sorry to hear that, he is a brave man.
<user1> Thank You he is very just 2 more months and me and our kids get to see him.
<user1> Did something ruin it?
<user0> Nothing really, except some indigestion much later in the day.
<user1> well thats not too bad
<user1> I can't think of a certain moment that the idea clicked. It seems like I've always known they can.
<user0> Lucky you, I have a sharp memory of that moment.
<user1> What was that moment for you?
<user1> Im sorry but I am laughing. I bet you were so embarrassed. 
<user0> It is pretty funny now but at the time I was red face it was awkward I know lot's of people noticed it lol.
<user1> I would imagine. Just own it and wear it like a badge. 
<user1> Its nice to have the internet
<user0> How did people live without it just a couple decades ago?
<user1> I cannot even imagine
<user1> Sounds very relaxing to me, as long as my allergies don't act up.
<user0> That's right we have to keep those in mind.
<user1> I always keep some propolis pills with me just in case.
<user1> What happened that made you have to do that?
<user0> Just some drunken guy, tried to attack me.
<user1> OH goodness!  Are you ok?
<user1> I enjoy sunny weather too.
<user0> Yes, how do people live in those cloudy cities like Seattle? 
<user1> They must enjoy the rain.
<user1> Oh no, I'm sorry hun. I hope you're at least moving for a good reason like better opportunities. 
<user0> Yes, it should at least be better for me financially. 
<user1> Well there is at least one positive. Maybe you could try joining some meet up groups to help you acclimate. 
<user1> I do almost everyday I feel like that is a great mindset to have to make your day successful.
<user0> I am glad we have this in common, many people are so negative in this world.
<user1> They are but to just be able to continue throughout another day is a great feeling.
<user1> I agree, do you have a favorite artist?
<user0> I love Vincent van Gogh his paintings are so moving and a lot of the art shows are close to his creativeness. 
<user1> Yes, he is great no wonder his work is so expensive.
<user1> That's good. Did you find out the results of the test?
<user0> Not yet. I should find out within the next week.
<user1> Good luck on the exam! 
<user1> What does providence mean?
<user0> Means something extraordinary, like higher power.
<user1> Okay, tell me more about that.
<user1> That's great. Does he do photography as a job or a hobby?
<user0> Just as a hobby. But he's good at it.
<user1> Maybe he can turn it into a career and make a lot of money!
<user1> That sounds wonderful!  I've never been on a cruise, I bet you are excited and ready to go!
<user0> Me either it will be a first for us all I am very excited only thing we are not arranged and ready yet we still have lot's to do.
<user1> I know that feeling all too well.  Too much to do and not enough time to do it all, and certain things you can't do until the week of.  Hopefully you will get it all done and then you guys will have a great time!
<user1> Wow what kind of dog did you lose?
<user0> A teacup yorkie I miss her so much I have been so heart broken since they stole her while we was out shopping. Had to be someone who was watching us and waited until we left. 
<user1> That's so tragic I have 3 dogs myself, do you have flyers up?
<user0> Yes I do but no call backs yet wish we had a chip in her.
<user0> Oof, I hope that doesn't wake you up
<user1> It does, and I get so upset. Apparently she doesn't ever do it to my girlfriend, only when I come over.
<user0> Maybe it doesn't fell very comfortable with having you over and doesn't have any other way of expressing itself
<user0> that's cool.  Do you celebrate both of them on the same day?
<user1> We do! Exchanging gifts makes it feel like Christmas in the summer and it made me so happy.
<user0> haha I bet.  That's pretty awesome!  
<user0> oh no. did something bad happen?
<user1> It actually went well. I felt I could give her the benefit of the doubt considering she has been doing really well recently. 
<user0> That;s great. I have always been nervous no matter who drew my blood.
<user1> I agree! I',m the same way, but even more since she is new, but I had confidence in her 
<user0> She is going to be great at that job
<user1> Yeah she is. I knew the manager done well when she hired her and this proves it. I know I can wean her from shadowing me now. 
<user1> Oh no. How'd they react?
<user0> He didnt get upset.. He said it happens alot, but I can feel my face get red!
<user1> I'd be super embarassed, too!
<user0> Yes it was very embarrassing! we both laughed at it. 
<user0> Wow, that's horrible, I hope he calmed down after and apologized to everyone
<user1> Unfortunately, no. Despite him scaring everyone, he did not care.
<user0> Yikes, I would definitely stage an intervention with the rest of your family, let him understand it's not okay
<user1> I agree, I wish it were that easy. At least he's cut down on the excessive drinking and we get along kind of fine now. It's better than nothing right?
<user1> I remember those
<user0> They were awesome and I wanted one so badly, but my parents could not afford it. I felt very bitter towards my friends for a while after.
<user1> I never had one. I didnt know they were expensive
<user1> That's great! I hope you keep getting good reviews like that.
<user0> Yeah im very happy to know what comes next, since I will find out how much of a raise I will get from this. I cant wait!
<user1> That's awesome. How much do you anticpate the raise to be?
<user0> Im hoping alot, but Im overjoyed about it!
<user0> oh thats cool, is she good ?
<user1> She's super talented. She made a few dresses and cosplay within a month. 
<user0> oh thats cool
<user1> Yeah! I was surprised she could pull it off in such a short time.
<user1> oh that sounds like it will be very rewarding!
<user0> Unfortunately, I had to switch majors; the program was too difficult to stay in and my mental health was deteriorating.
<user1> a tough situation but at least you were able to realize and adapt!
<user1> Oh god. The living room is shared. She should just leave the messiness in her room.
<user0> I agree completely! I get so irritated and I always tell her to clean up after herself, but she seems so very lackadaisical. 
<user1> How old is she?
<user0> She just turned 18, so there's really no excuse.
<user0> I'm so sorry to hear that. How old is the cat?
<user1> Only a couple of years old. It's so upsetting to think that she won't make it for much longer.
<user0> All you can do is make sure she's not in too much pain as she goes.
<user0> I hope you walked out right then and there!
<user1> I didnt. I kept on with the date. She was very pretty and well dressed. She drove a nice care. I was kind of envious of it. 
<user0> ah that was really disrespectful of her though. That's not someone you'd want to date long term.
<user1> Yeah i agree. At the moment I was just envying her look. I wish I could have what she did. 
<user1> That is good to hear. She should be a big help a lot quicker than normal then.
<user0> I agree! Everyone including me were quite shocked byt it. 
<user1> That should bode well for her and her future there though, so it was a good surprise!
<user0> Yes it was. We all didnt think she woudl do well so fast. Took us by suprise. 
<user0> How has it been going?
<user1> Its very boring since Im usally home by myself alot. NOw that Iim starting to date it wont be so boring. 
<user0> That is good, hopefully you find your soulmate.
<user1> Yes I agree. I live alone and are new to the city so it can be very boring. 
<user1> Oh god. Did anything happen?
<user0> Everybody was screaming and leaving the place! It was very scary for everyone! I didnt stay to find out. 
<user1> Well, I hope nothing bad happened!
<user0> I agree. I bet the little kids have never seen nothing like this. How horrible!
<user0> I watched it too! My favorite is Federer. Who is yours?
<user1> I like watching Serena Williams. Do you watch every summer?
<user0> I have for the past 10 years! It's one of my favorite sports to watch.
<user0> That's great. Do you thiink you will get a raise?
<user1> I really think I will. I dont expect less than that. I have confidence in it. 
<user0> Confidence is super important
<user1> I agree. I have no doubt it will go well. 
<user0> good luck. even though you don't need it
<user1> Thanks! I feel and have confidence it will be a good raise!
<user1> That's great! You must be happy!
<user0> I was! It was very unexpected and exciting. Although, I was hoping to have time to clean the place up before he got home.
<user1> How come he came home early?
<user1> That's really thoughtful of you. Do you typically do things like that?
<user0> Well I volunteer to help abused and battered kids. I wanted to show her things like this. I know she can be a good loving person. 
<user1> Perhaps I should find the local shelter in my community and do the same. I have never done that before and I feel like I should be giving back to those less fortunate in some capacity.
<user0> It makes you feel very good with yourself to be able to do things like this. I love and cherish those moments. 
<user0> Yay! Do you guys have free time to spend together now?
<user1> Yes. I'm very excited since I haven't seen him in two weeks.
<user0> That sounds great, you should make him dinner to surprise him back!
<user0> How long did that last for?
<user1> for a good 45 minutes. At that it was during rush hour. everybody was so mad at them. 
<user0> Why didn't you tell them to move?
<user1> We all were honking and yelling at them, but they didnt pay no mind. How inconsiderat of them. 
<user1> You must really miss them.
<user0> I really do.  I mean we're in constant contact over the internet through instant messaging and video calls.  But it's not often that we all can get together and see each other in person.
<user1> Yea. Seeing each other on a screen definitely can't beat being with each other in person.
<user0> Definitely.  We've talked about making plans to visit each other but it's hard to find the time to organize it.
<user0> did he catch you doing something crazy?
<user1> No, thankfully I was just eating. 
<user0> Thats good lol
<user0> That's so sad. Do you have any other friends there?
<user1> Yeah i do, but she was the one I was closest to. Yes I was very sad.
<user0> I am so sorry for you. Perhaps you can hang with her after your workdays?
<user1> Yeah maybe we can do that. Its not the same though. 
<user1> New York is a fun place to visit.
<user0> I agree. I never been there so Im so happy!
<user1> You will have a blast.
<user0> Yes I will!. I cant wait!
<user0> Oh no! was it too short for your liking?
<user1> Actually I had to shave my head off. She used new product that burnt my hair! 
<user0> Yikes! I would ask for a refund for sure
<user1> Yes! Im so mad at her. She knows better! I cant beleive this!
<user1> Wow! Well a cheat day here and there might be okay! Haha
<user0> I agree. I feel bad for doing so!
<user1> Right, but I'd say once isn't too bad as long you stay on track.
<user0> I agree. Ill do my best not too. I feel horrible eating a whole pizza. I will pay for it tomorrow. 
<user0> I would feel terrible too. Where did you move to?
<user1> I moved to a town about 30-45 minutes away, but at that point we were so used to seeing each other every day of our lives.  It was hard to get used to.
<user0> I've moved almost half a dozen times in my life before, so I completely understand. Those were rough times.
<user1> Yeah, it's always a big hassle having to pick up and go like that.  There's so much to take care of and do before you make the actual move.
<user1> That sucks, imagine being in an environment like that all day, I would go crazy
<user0> I agree. It made me sick to my stomach seeing it. I feel bad for them!
<user1> I guess some people are just really rude, no matter what position you put them in
<user0> Yeah. It makes me wanna puke thinking about how mean he was!
<user0> It's hard to trust a GPS. I have heard a lot of stories about people being steered the wrong way. Please tell me you didn't do it.
<user1> I was very nervous and doubting to do it. I actually did and it wasnt that bad
<user0> I am so glad that it didn't turn out bad for you. 
<user1> Me too. At first I wasnt going to, but I didnt want to get lost. 
<user1> what did he do , how did he react ?
<user0> He rejected me and told me not to every call him again. Im so embarrassed. I should have known better. 
<user1> Well he is the one missing out and  i'm sure your very worthy of attention from some better.
<user0> Maybe. I just feel bad and embarrassed about it. I should known better not to mess up our friendship. 
<user0> Why was she upset? Depending on how many people entered, fifth could be really good.
<user1> There were 30 girls. We worked very hard and felt she would place top 3 but what an outcome it was to be 5th. 
<user0> That's still really good! She did better than 25 other people. 
<user1> I agree.Im proud of her, but she was very upset at the judges. 
<user1> NIce! I bet you cant wait! Do you anticipate to releax or do things to catch up?
<user0> Just relaxing this weekend. 
<user1> Very nice! I bet its going to be a good happy weekend. 
<user1> Dang, and here I thought I was lucky winning a free soft drink in that contest. Maybe we have to pool our efforts together and try to win us something big?
<user0> I know, man just got together and buy like 50 boxes and cross our fingers.  And another thing was he got it on his first try both times.
<user1> Why stop at 50? We ought to get 100! We need to show your friend and evil corporate Taco Bell who is boss and nab us some consoles!
<user0> Haha, that's the spirit!  Win us some systems, sell them off and use the money to buy more boxes.
<user0> Did you let him?
<user1> We have been practicing together in my car , so I feel I can let him. 
<user0> You are good to allow him to borrow the car.
<user1> Yeah. I feel he wont let me down. 
<user1> Wow, I really like to do that. I hope you will enjoy it..
<user0> I dont know. I hate heights, so im very nervous about it
<user1> Ah ok. If you try once you will be alright next time..
<user0> I dont think I will ever not be scared of heights. The thought of it makes me have the chills!
<user0> That sounds revolting! Have you said anything to him about it?
<user1> No. I'm not very confrontational. And our lease is up in two months anyway so I'm just going to wait it out.
<user0> That sounds like a good plan. Perhaps you should request a formal resume from any potential roommates for your future abode.
<user0> Did you ask her to stop it or did you have to move away from her?
<user1> well the library is very small so limited seats so I had to sit there and listen to it. I was so frusterated
<user0> That was very rude of her to do that, some people just have no manners.
<user1> Yah I agree. I could understand if it was not so quiet and an open place. I can still hear it in my ear now!
<user1> That's so exciting! Have you run a marathon before?
<user0> I never have. I think all this time I been practicing will pay off.
<user1> That's good, I hope you do well! How did you prepare?
<user0> I joined cross fit and did alot of cardio work outs.I think this helped me for it.
<user0> What a nice surprise! Did something happen or did he miss you!?
<user1> His business trip wrapped up a few days earlier than planned.
<user0> I see.I bet you and him are happy to be able to spend a little time together. 
<user0> I'm sorry to hear. Why is that?
<user1> I am finally getting to take the kids to Disneyland! 
<user0> Oh, well that is a fine thing indeed! I would be  jumping up and down!
<user0> Sounds pretty lonely. Did you meet or make some friends while out of town?
<user1> No, I was too busy focusing on work while I was there.
<user0> Ah I see. Staying focused is hard, especially when your lonely.
<user0> That's horrible! Is she going to try again?
<user1> Yeah she is. She is going to retake some classes she made a B in. The look on her face after she found out was pricelss.
<user0> It must have been awful to see that in someone you care about. I'm glad she's not giving up.
<user1> yeah thats what i said. Its like the world ended when she found out, but she is doing better now.
<user1> wow , thats great. You must be loving it
<user0> Yeah I cant wait. I never been, so I cant sleep thinking about it.
<user1> You must get a good sleep now to enjoy the New york later
<user0> Yeah Im going to try, but its so exciting and my nerves are everywhere!
<user0> Nice! Were they scratch offs?
<user1> For the powerball. We are all crossing our fingers!
<user0> I will cross mine too! I hope ya'll win it big.
<user1> WE hope we do to!
<user1> OMG....that had to be so scary.
<user0> Yes it was. My phone rang and thats what woke me up. Im so lucky to be here today. 
<user1> I am so glad that you are. Now no more driving when your sleepy.
<user0> Yeah im very thankful I didnt crash last night. 
<user0> That really sucks. Maybe you should try egging their door? Or just break in and pretend you're bigfoot while they're trying to sleep.
<user1> I'm not trying to get arrested! I think I'll just wait things out until I move in two months.
<user0> I would go with the bigfoot option. You can get a costume on the cheap on ebay nowadays. I've used that tactic countless times and it has never failed!
<user0> That is some exciting news. Do you already know what kind of vehicle you want?
<user1> Yes! Very exciting! Yes I had my eye on one all year. I cant wait
<user0> Christmas is coming early. You will have to take me for a ride.
<user0> I am sure you will. Good luck for you!!
<user1> Thanks! It will be a breeze. 
<user0> Whats kind of exam is that?
<user1> Statistics exam. I aced this class for sure. There's no doubt in my mind. 
<user1> Don't be. i think you will ace it.
<user0> I hope so. I usually do better than I expect to, but that still doesn't make it any less scary.
<user1> exam's are always scary. we just need to take the mind out of it
<user1> Why not block the calls?
<user0> I want them to be able to get in touch with me if something important comes up.
<user1> Have you asked them to stop calling about this topic?
<user1> Have you spoken to him?
<user0> No, I don't like to be confrontational. I'm moving in two months anyway, so I'm just going to wait it out.
<user1> Maybe you should buy some earplugs.
<user1> I love tennis. Will you watch the US Open?
<user0> Maybe. I hadn't considered it yet.
<user1> It is a great tournament, you should watch.
<user1> So are they telling you good news?
<user0> Not yet. I just filled out the prequalification online. I haven't officially applied yet.
<user1> Oh okay. Well hopefully they give you a chance to breathe and decide what you want to do.
<user1> Ooh how nice! Do you have any guesses as to what she may be making you?
<user0> Nope! She was going to make something completely different from what she usually makes!
<user1> Well I hope it's good! Your mom sounds like a great person to have a fun surprise for you like that.
<user1> You are so lucky to find someone special online. That can turn out so badly sometimes for some people. 
<user0> Oh I know. I got lucky, we found out we lived really close to each other so we met up and it has been great ever since.
<user1> That sounds like fate? Being that both of you lived close to each other.
<user1> Wow, watching kids grow up is hard. How has she been with the cell phone?
<user0> She has been good so far. We are trying to limit her access to it to just a few hours per day. She also had to "turn it in" at night before she goes to bed.
<user1> That's great parenting! You have to trust that your children will make the right choices.
<user0> Yes, you do! Hopefully she keeps doing the right thing with it
<user1> I am sure with your guidance she will!
<user1> You should go, Otherwise the condition could get worse.
<user0> I ended up going. I'm really glad I did. She has been a HUGE help for me.
<user1> That is great news! fortunately doctors are there to help us and i'm glad they have helped you!
<user1> Oh my goodness that sounds so bad! Did they charge you for the visit?
<user0> No. I just asked what it would cost to fix then told him I couldn't afford it to get him to leave. 
<user1> You made the right move. They at least have to show up with that giant truck that sucks the tank dry.
<user1> If I had a bag of M&M's right now I would eat them for sure!
<user0> well that is what I just did, so far I have eaten half of it
<user1> maybe save the other half for later. lol.
<user0> I do not think I can and feel ashamed that I cannot resist it
<user1> That's ok, it happens to us all. Tomorrow is a new day.
<user1> How did she reacted to the admission to self harm? 
<user0> She was really sad, but she appreciated the fact that I told her. 
<user1> Now that your girlfriend knows the problem,  the both of you can work on solutions and support together.
<user1> Is that like a laser tag place? That sounds like a lot of fun! What do you think?
<user0> Yeah exactly. I wasn't sure if I'd like it or not and I was a little unwilling to try it out. 
<user1> I've played laser tag a few times. I think you will have a great time! It's very high paced and noisy but that's half the fun.
<user1> Oh that sounds worrisome, do you think you will pass?
<user0> I'm fairly certain I'm going to fail and I feel awful about myself, but I just can't get myself to do it.
<user1> I'm sad to hear that but human nature is hard to fight. Honestly, if you have any alternative options or plans you may have to fall back on them.
<user1> That sounds intensive! How did it go?
<user0> It went awful. It turned out that the motherboard or processor were defective and we had to deconstruct it to return both pieces. So much wasted time!
<user1> I bet that was so defeating! I'm sorry to hear that. I wish there was better quality control with some of these companies that deal in parts.
<user0> It really was. At least my friend learned a lot about computers as we built it together!
<user1> That's a good bright side to look at.
<user1> Did you save it or kill it?
<user0> I saved it. I brought it outside and hoped for the best.
<user1> It's missing a leg so its probably dead unfortunately.
<user1> ooh, I bet you can't wait to finish!
<user0> You got that right! I'm feeling pretty happy about my performance and I think I'll get the job!
<user1> I hope you get it! Good luck!
<user1> How did they go? Did you pass?
<user0> It went amazing! I expected to pass but I didn't think I'd get a 91!
<user1> Wow! congrats, you should totally be proud of yourself.
<user1> That's very sweet! I bet it brought up a lot of feelings inside you.
<user0>  Definitely. I felt so warm and fuzzy on the inside, and so did she when I sent her a snapchat of it.
<user1> You guys sound like you have a solid relationship. It's always great to find those little pieces from the early days.
<user1> Did you get her number?
<user0> Nah. I have a loving girlfriend and I would never cheat on her.
<user1> Good man, I have a lot of respect for that.
<user1> That sounds like quite the checklist. I'm glad you brought the beer you might need it haha!
<user0> Oh yeah definitely. Never have I ever felt so ready for anything in my life.
<user1> Well I bet you're going to have a great time. With that haul I don't see how you couldn't!
<user1> Holy cow! Did you call him in?
<user0> I should have, but last time my girlfriend did that the police ignored it. I was so angry.
<user1> Oh man!  Do you have a dog?
<user0> I do, and I couldn't fathom how someone could do that. I wanted to hop off the bus and yell at the guy.
<user0> How come? And was it a pain to replace it?
<user1> I'm not sure what happened.  I had to have a guy come out to replace it, and couldn't meet him, so my wife had to.
<user0> I hope he did a good job!
<user1> My said he did!  I had quite a bit of confidence in him, based on others' feedback.
<user0> Awesome, I'm glad to hear that. Sometimes it's hard to find contractors with good reputation.
<user0> How come you didn't collect them? i loved them myself.
<user1> I think my parents found them expensive, otherwise I can't think of any other good reason. To be honest, I kind of envied my friends.
<user0> Well, they are expensive and you didn't really miss much.
<user1> In that case, I feel much better haha.
<user1> Nice, Was it hard to start?
<user0> Unimaginably hard. But once I got into it I couldn't stop. I'm feeling pretty certain that I'll hit my 5km goal in no time.
<user1> Wish i could run close to 5km, i'd struggle with 100 meters.
<user0> I used to be that guy too. If I can do it, you can do it.
<user0> That's cool. Man, those tiny disks were easy to lose. what game?
<user1> He was playing Paper Mario and the Thousand Year Door. What an awesome game! It brought back so many great memories.
<user0> That's awesome. I get nostalgic about old games as well. 
<user0> That sounds horrible, Did you wash it or throw it away?
<user1> I washed it and it came out surprisingly. But at that time, I felt so sick seeing what was happening to my jacket that I thought I was going to puke next.
<user0> That is a really rough story, You should make him pay for another one.
<user0> damn, is he ok now?
<user1> Thankfully he is. He's doing much better, but the thought still shakes me scared to this day.
<user0> Did he go to the doctors for help? anyway i'm glad he is OK.
<user1> Yeah he did. He's on meds and he sees a therapist every week!
<user1> Oh no! Was it a fun night? 
<user0> It was, but it got scary at some point. Apparently people were trying to wake me up by shaking me and I would not get up.
<user1> Oh heck! That had to be really scary for them! glad you're okay though! 
<user1> Aww, that sounds interesting!  Are you in touch with many people from high school?
<user0> A couple people. Fewer as the years go by, unfortunately. 
<user1> I get that.  It's weird when I forget the name of someone I knew for years.
<user1> Poor thing!  Is he felling better now?  I hope he quit that diet.
<user0> He quit the diet a while ago as recommended by his doctor. I was a little scared but I knew it was just side effects of a bad diet.
<user1> Thank god he is ok.  There are very dangerous diets around, better be guided by his doctor.
<user1> Were you nervous?
<user0> No, he's such a good driver. I knew I had nothing to worry about.
<user1> That's awesome.  I'm glad he did so well.
<user1> That's lovely! I love waking up to awesome texts.
<user0> Yeah! I had a moment of realizing how lucky I am to be in the position I find myself in, and felt really thankful for my life and the people a part of it.
<user1> That's so wonderful to hear.
<user1> How did that make you feel?
<user0> Really lonesome. I missed her so much.
<user1> I bet. I'm not great at being away from my boyfriend.
<user1> That's great! What have you been doing to socialize?
<user0> Just talking to more people in general. For example, at a convention I was volunteering at. 
<user1> What kind of convention?
<user0> It's called Otakuthon. It celebrates Japanese culture, anime and videogames. I was with MSI and I was just so surprised with my improvement.
<user0> That's such a sweet thing to do.
<user1> Thank you, they're so cute!
<user0> Dogs are probably my favorite pet. Maybe I should take up volunteering for a dog shelter one day.
<user0> Lil Peep died? when.
<user1> November of 2017. Almost a year ago. 
<user0> damn, him and XXXtentacion we're really good.
<user1> Never really listened to XXX but Peep's music really resonated with me.
<user1> I love puppies! But they definitely are a lot of work in terms of their hair.
<user0> You're right. I'm just so irritated, even if it isn't his fault and I love the big goof.
<user1> I understand. Our puppy sheds a ton too and he isnt even that hairy of a dog
<user1> Oh my, that sounds like an absolute blast!
<user0> It was. At that time, I couldn't wait for all the fun and games we would experience!
<user1> Did you stay for long? That would be a great vacation. 
<user0> We stayed for only 4 days because it cost us about $200 each for four days and nights, but I hope we can book it for a whole week or two next summer.
<user1> What a great time! Is the cottage on a lake?
<user0> It's very close to a lake, it probably takes a two minute hike down through a patch of trees and tall grass to get there.
<user1> Sounds like heaven!
<user1> Oh no! Did you get in trouble?
<user0> Yes, they called my parents and I was sent home. I got spanked
<user1> Aww, I'm sorry. Hope that teacher learned a lesson 
<user1> It's wonderful peace of mind to find someone you can trust with your fur babies! Did you have a nice trip?
<user0> Yes, I was able to go visit my stepdaughter on the other side of the country. The sitter sent pictures occasionally, so I didn't spend my trip worrying.
<user1> Aw, that was so nice! I'd love to find a cat sitter like that!
<user1> How did it go? What'd you get him for a gift?
<user0> He got a remote control excavator, and had a lot of fun at his party.  It's crazy how fast he's growing up, though.
<user1> It seems like all those years just flew by, huh. At least now he's getting old enough to start remembering all these great times!
<user1> Are you feeling zapped from the week?
<user0> Yeah, there's a lot going on.  I ended up heading to work anyway.
<user1> I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you don't have to work through the weekend!
<user0> No, I don't have to.  But there's plenty of work to do on our house!
<user1> It never ends does it? I hope you keep your head above water though, it's all you got sometimes!
<user1> I feel that pain. Do you not have the motivation or just dont know what to do?
<user0> I don't have the motivation. I know the workouts I should be doing but also struggle with proper form a bit.
<user1> I get that. Well if I could give any advice it would be make sure you have proper form over anything. Dont worry about heavy weight if your form is garbage.
<user0> Thanks for the advice!
<user1> Sure. I love working out. 
<user1> How much pain are you on a scale of 1-10?
<user0> on bad days it is about a 6
<user1> Dang that sounds bad! I know you might be frightened of going but I think you should go. You'll be better off for it.
<user1> That was nice of them! I bet you felt really cool hanging with them. How did it go?
<user0> Yeah it was awesome! I was a little scared at first but within a few hours of arriving there it turned into a total blast!
<user1> That is awesome! I love festivals, they're always great to unwind and even just walk around talking to people.
<user1> Why not, have you have many temptations?  I know how difficult it can be at times to eat healthy, I struggle to do it too.
<user0> Yeah. Carbs like pasta and bread get me every time. 
<user1> I know, fresh bread is a big temptation to me, and what about sweets and desserts, do you have a weakness for those too?
<user0> Yup. Even though I don't need to lose any weight, I want to be healthy and cheating on this diet makes me feel bad.
<user0> It's really a good start to recognized that you should talk about it. We all need someone to just listen once in awhile.
<user1> Yeah you're right. I had faith in them and they ended up being really supportive.
<user0> Oh that's a good friend. I hope your feeling better now.
<user0> I like dominos better
<user1> It tastes pretty good now, but I still like the oily goodness of Pizza Hut!
<user0> Dominoes, IMO, has better prices and better pizza. I dont like all that oil
<user0> That's thoughtful of her. Nice to know that your mom was thinking of you in the middle of the day.
<user1> Yup, she is the best! I shall make it up to her one day!
<user0> Take her out to dinner! That would be a treat.
<user0> Oh no! You must've felt ashamed. did you return it?
<user1> Yes, I got caught and had to walk back in shame!
<user0> Hopefully they were understanding that it was accidental?
<user0> Did you get wrote up or a lecture when you got their.
<user1> Well I will find out tomorrow. I know better than that is what she told me, especially on Fridays, when we are the busiest. 
<user0> Its always best to be on time , I hope they understand no one is perfect.
<user1> I agree. I feel so bad and embarrassed about it. Even the doctor scolded me. 
<user1> The journey there is always the toughest, its years of practice and studying but in the end it will be totally worth it
<user0> I agree. I guess I will weigh my options, its just im getting old and watn to start a family too, so I dont know.
<user1> With whatever you decide in life just know that you are a very skilled and intelligent person! Im sure you will find your path in life eventually with time
<user0> Thank you for that! You just made my day!
<user0> Wow,  that was serious then
<user1> Yeah. I want to stay true to my beliefs, but she made some very valid points. 
<user0> OK,  so what is your plan now? 
<user1> I will do research about her theories and then make really think about sticking to my beliefs. 
<user1> Wow that sounds scary. Did you make good friends?
<user0> Yes, I did eventually. There's something to be said for living in a dorm at a time when you want to meet new people and fit in.
<user1> Yes it can be really helpful! I went to school 3 hours from my home and it was still hard to meet new people
<user1> Oh, that must have been a hard thing to do. I'd hate to be the one to deliver such a bad news...
<user0> Yeah I felt bad. She started crying so much. Its like her world ended there.
<user1> So sad...that makes me want to cry, too, just hearing about her reaction.
<user1> I bet it does! Do you go by there often?
<user0> I get to visit about once a year. I always wish that I knew who lived there now so I could see the inside of the house.
<user1> I bet it's much different than it was back when you lived there.
<user0> A little, but mostly I love seeing all the things that are the same.
<user0> Oh no :( Can you tell me? It's okay if it's too private.
<user1> I just got back my grade for my final for my class and I failed it. I studied real hard, but unfortunately it didn't seem to matter.
<user0> Oh my gosh I'm so sorry that really sucks. :( Can you talk to the professor and try to make it up or find out what you did wrong?
<user1> I'm going to have to at least try. Maybe they'll be understanding and let me attempt again.
<user0> Good luck to you! I wish you all the best <3
<user0> Oh no why would they do such a thing
<user1> They were angry and wanted to be aggressive. 
<user0> Definitely doesn't excuse what they did.
<user0> That's not cool. I bet it felt awkward.
<user1> It really did but I would never do something to jeopardize my relationship.
<user0> You are a stand up person!
<user0> Nice, silence is golden
<user1> Well, my family was here, too.  Toddlers don't make life quiet, but they make me feel fulfilled.
<user0> Full of what?
<user1> Full of meaning.
<user1> Oh no, was it one of those meetings that should have been an email?
<user0> It definitely was, so I ended up skipping it.
<user1> Hopefully you don't get in trouble but I definitely know the feeling. 
<user0> I regretted skipping the meeting a little bit, but probably not as much as if I'd gone to it.
<user0> Oh really, were you supposed to tell them?
<user1> It was my choice. I really don't think they'll tell anyone! They're good people.
<user0> You can never be to sure now a days, they might post your secret to social media.
<user0> Did you ace your test?
<user1> Yup, I was worried during the test too, but I am glad everything turned out okay
<user0> I always worry when I have to take tests. Unfortunately, I am horrible with tests. I am glad you aced it!
<user0> Nice, what a legend and a gentleman
<user1> Yeah, but I haven't had one in 3 years.
<user0> Word, you should ask him what the secret is
<user0> That kind of cold disregard for someone you're supposed to love is totally alien to me, the guilt would destroy me.
<user1> It would me too, not only that but he just up and got with her like I never existed to him.   Its funny because he always accused me of cheating on him and I had no clue why.  It was him the whole time!
<user0> Yeah Freud called it Projection, it's too bad people tend to hide their true natures so well.
<user0> It's awful! I know so many families are dealing with similar situation. Sometimes we don't know how to help someone close to us. Heart breaking...
<user1> Yes you are right about that.  I dealt with it for a long time and then I just couldn't anymore.  Over and over things would disappear and he would of course always deny it.  He became violent at time to his sister and me and I couldn't put them at risk.
<user0> You can't help him until he wants to really change. Sometimes all you can do is pray.
<user0> Did she feel bad and apologize after she realized what you had done?
<user1> she was joking about it, but she was so happy afterwards and we ate together, it was such a nice day
<user0> It's good to get to spend time with those you love. I am happy for you.
<user0> That's inspiring, has that worked for you in the past in the same way?
<user1> yes always, it is something that works for me
<user0> That's so cool, you seem very intuitive
<user0> That sounds frightening. Did you get home safely?
<user1> in the end yes.. but the journey was sure hell
<user0> Why were you walking so late at night?
<user0> Nice, what are some things you realized?
<user1> that i have everything i wished for.
<user0> You don't have me yet <3
<user0> oh god, how did you . have the courage to even go outside?
<user1> My house flooded so I had to get on my roof !
<user0> that sounds like an adventurous day 
<user0> Wow, how could they do that?
<user1> They are complete monsters I tell ya!
<user0> Someone's gotta put an end to that poor service!
<user0> You should. No matter what you can't lie to your Mom. It will always come back on you.
<user1> i just realised this now
<user0> Come clean and fix it. It will make you feel better.
<user0> Nice! Do you have any superpowers?
<user1> In a way yes,yes i do the power of my will and mind
<user0> I like your confidence! Fighting!
<user0> oh nice, what kind of memories?
<user1> Memories of talking to strangers in chatroom. Lots of things 
<user0> how does this make you feel like?
<user0> That's awesome! You're going to be rolling in the dough with those skills
<user1> Hell yeah, no more living in mom's basement!
<user0> That's exciting. How long have you been learning programming?
<user0> an interesting one, what does this make you feel ?
<user1> Well at first I thought it was cute until I saw him at the gas station the other day.  I overheard him asking someone that was getting gas if he happened to have a little change he could have.  He needed to get home in his lawnmower but didn't have the money to do so.   I ended up giving him 3 bucks.
<user0> oh did he say anything afterwards? what happend next?
<user0> That is so kind of you, I also a have a soft heart for animals.  I happen to be a dog person, but I do have a cat that was my ex boyfriends.  
<user1> i am a both person ahaha i also have a dog, but he is always so mean 
<user0> I can't say I have had any mean dogs as of yet.  My favorite breed is  a pitbull.   THey are so loyal  and sweet although  lots of people claim they are mean and vicious .
<user0> where are you going!
<user1> TO SEE MY BABY GIRL
<user0> thats awesome i hope you have a good time with her
<user0> Wow, that must've been disappointing.
<user1> Yes, I was off by one number. I was going to be a millionaire!
<user0> Oh! So close. Just to think about that missed opportunity.
<user0> Yeah, it's like time passes but the smells and everything stays the same
<user1> yes! i am so glad you get it, it's beautiful but also sad at the same time
<user0> Yup, and I feel there's a part of us that is eternal as well
<user0> I think I would leave if I saw something like that.
<user1> I left as fast as possible!
<user0> Did you tell someone about it so they could take care of it?
<user1> Nope, just you!
<user0> It seems most responsible to alert someone to clean it.
<user0> I feel that way sometimes when I check my bank account, how's school going?
<user1> I failed and dropped out! Now I live in my parents house doing nothing all day
<user0> Word, college is tough, wishing you the best
<user0>  and got upset with you?
<user1> no i was the one who was upset with him
<user0>  And why do not you try to teach your brother?
<user1> PROGRAMMING!
<user1> Good for you!  I hope it does not stress you out, though.
<user0> it doesn't i am taking regular breaks
<user1> That is good.  Money is no good if you are not healthy enough to enjoy it.
<user1> Dang, how fast did you run away?
<user0> I froze up because I was terrified. It was just my brother though
<user1> Did you tell him how creepy he is lol
<user1> That is awesome, what types of photos did you find? Anything funny or silly? 
<user0> Well more of my old best friend. I have not seen her i a long time.We went through alot together. It was nostalgic to me. 
<user1> Aww yeah, those are great times that you can never really go back to. Sometimes I also wish I could go back in time...maybe you could call her up again and catch up on the last few years! 
<user0> I agree! We have alot of things to catch up on. 
<user0> It's not fair, eh. Having to suppress those feelings day in and day out is significantly harder than the mundane work itself. At least it's comforting know that most everyone feels the same? 
<user1> Yes, it's true we all know this inside out, but we still continue to work on our meaningless lives, the funny thing is we all know but no one is acting, if we all acted we would be living in a much more beautiful and free life, not one which just gives the impression of freedom, that's all there is now, faking but i guess the one thing that is true is my feelings
<user0> Maybe if we weren't so attached to being creatures of comfort. Some things we just can't let go of, wouldn't exist without some poor shmuck having to do the dirty work. I guess we're all that shmuck to someone, someway or another.
<user0> Oh wow, what ovie was it and how did it make you feel? 
<user1> I don't remember the name. I was watching it with a friend and they put it on but it was about a son who found his birth mother after many years apart.
<user0> oh wow that sounds very emotional, I think I would have needed a bucket to catch all my tears. 
<user0> I liked my friend very much and believed that he can not talk negatively about me
<user1> what makes you so sure? anything can happen i mean just look at murphy's law 
<user0> May be you are right. But sometimes, you go with your heart not with the law. Murphy's law may not work in every situation.
<user0> Oh no, I am sorry to hear that. How is she doing and how are you holding up? 
<user1> She is getting much better. My family and I did everything we could to take care of her.
<user0> That is great that she has such a great support group and loving family members to support her. I hope she gets well soon! :)
<user0> Oh no, maybe buy her a new cake to make it up to her!
<user1> oh wow you are such a genius! why didn't i think of that before... there is always a bright side to everything
<user0> Yes there is! Maybe throw in a cupcake too, I am sure she will forgive you in a heart beat! I know I would. :) 
<user0> I am so happy for you! Why have you been apart for the past two weeks?
<user1> no we live in a long distance relationship (not for long though) so it's hard for me to see her, but i will be able to see her after 6 months apart  
<user0> Awesome to hear that you'll get to live with your loved one soon
<user0> Oh no what happened, are you alright? 
<user1> Yeah, I'm alright. But I dropped a jar of pasta sauce and it ended up shattering. Sauce got all over the floor.
<user0> Oh no that must have been a terrible experience, I hope no one got hurt from the shattered glass.
<user0> That's what I like to hear! What changes did you make this semester to achieve your possible 4.0?
<user1> I actually gave more effort this semester, so I will continue to do goo and hope to get into nursing school next year.
<user0> wow. that's awesome! you'll need  that work ethic in nursing school for sure.
<user1> I agree. Im planning and hopping things go well.
<user1> It sounds like you're quite the organized person!
<user0> Yea. I like to have things ready and done prior to make sure everything goes well.
<user1> I'm the same way a lot of the time. It's really a good way to avoid any unnecessary disasters.
<user1> That is so exciting! Best of luck to you man! I doubt she would reject such a great guy like you. :) 
<user0> Thanks! I think we are doing well so i wont be disappointed or sidetracked by a no from her.
<user1> That is great, I would also be surprised if she said no to a man like you! 
<user1> I wouldn't worry too much about it. None of it really matters, if we make a difference or not, we all end up dust in the end.
<user0> no, i don't believe that, whether you are having a bad day or not if you look at everything clearly you will see there is a next stage, just like birth death is a process
<user1> If telling yourself that makes you feel better, I found all of that to be much more stressful. To be completely honest with you I think people invented stories about the after life to make them more comfortable with death.
<user0> Not necessarily,  while it's true you have your traditional christian or Muslim that preach the afterlife as some miracle and hell, scaring people into not being themselves, but death isn't a scary phase, and i don't care about whether i am going to die, as that is just the ego trying to cling on and survive, i've passed that point, but after looking clearly you'll see there is more than just this dimension and that is just a simple fact, science tells us this too, it's not about feeling good or feeling comfortable with death, it's about growing 
<user0> Yeah, 70s were incredible, the dancing the cars, the women had style and the music was incredible.
<user1> RIGHT?! but now is just so bad, i wish i could go back
<user0> But we got to make the best of it, pretty soon elon musk will release flying cars and then life will be amazing again.
<user0> Congratulations on your success! I bet you worked incredible hard to achieve your goals.
<user1> thank you! it's always nice to tell you these things, you don't get jealous and you are just happy for me, thank you
<user0> There will always be people that are jealous of your success, but it is up to you to be the bigger person and handle it with grace.
<user0> Oh no, can you return it or get a refund?
<user1> No I didnt purchase insurance. When i saw it my blood was boiling!
<user0> I am sorry to hear that, I would have felt the same way. 
<user1> yeah. Im so upset i cant even think right nowl
<user1> That has got to be rough. At least it has a home now that hopefully has more time.
<user0> I agree, but im praying they will take care of him. hes just a puppy.
<user1> I'm sure they will be great to him and he'll bring them joy as well!
<user0> Yeah thats all i can ask for.
<user0> OH no! Are you the jealous type?
<user1> It definitely had me feeling a little uneasy about the whole situation.
<user0> OH man! Yeah I would of felt the same way!
<user0> oh no do you feel ready for it? 
<user1> I'm super ready for it! I spent so much time studying over the last week.
<user0> That is great, I believe that you will do amazing! 
<user0> Oh that sounds really annoying. maybe you can look it up online or get someone to help?
<user1> there isn't any solution it's a century award i am working on, it's the problem of non-polynomial descent 
<user0> Oh I see, well good luck to you, I hope you'll solve it soon.
<user0> That is great, what has been going on in your life recently?
<user1> I've just been getting things done. Nothing has been going amazing but nothing really sucks either.
<user0> That is good, sometimes that is all you really need to do, get things done  one step at a time :) 
<user0> They looked really exciting! Does it make you want to play it again?
<user1> It does. I put so much time in that game before. I might have to pick it up again.
<user0> If it makes you happy then you should do it! Capitalize on that nostalgic feeling while you can.
<user0> That is always frustrating. What happened?
<user1> I woke up to find out my car was sideswiped while it was parked by the curb during the night. No note or anything.
<user0> Wow, some people are just terrible! I hate when people don't take responsibility for their actions.
<user0> What did he do?
<user1> He got caught cheating by his teacher on a test the other day.
<user0> Oh no. What do you think caused him to do that?
<user1> Probably because he did not study enough so was unprepared.
<user1> What was it that you accidentally ate?
<user0> I bought a sandwich and after a few bite I noticed that there was a bunch of mold.
<user1> Eww that sounds horrible! Were you able to get a refund at least?
<user0> I was!
<user0> I'm glad it went as planned. I can imagine that to be a very stressful moment.
<user1> it really was its just so scary but I had to believe the experience and caring nature of the midwives would get my through it and it did.  I really admire anyone in that career, its not just a job but a vocation.
<user0> You've really got to be committed to go into work like that. It's not for everybody, I agree.
<user1> Indeed.  The really do work with life and death everyday.
<user1> I know how hard diets are to stick to. What foods are you avoiding?
<user0> Fried foods. I feel bad I didn't commit to it the first day. 
<user1> Don't be too hard on yourself, it's hard to quit something immediately. Just keep trying, I believe in you!
<user0> Thank you! I need that motivation so I can get over this shame im feeling. 
<user1> I get it. There is always another meal to start making the change!
<user1> Why not? What happens tomorrow?
<user0> I have to talk to a large group at work tomorrow. 
<user1> Don't let it worry you too much. Just make sure you organize everything you need to present and remember to speak loudly and clearly! You can do it!
<user1> That sounds creepy! Is there any chance someone could start escorting you to your car? There is strength in numbers!
<user0> I agree. I had goosbumps all over and chills down my spine. 
<user1> I definitely recommend getting some mace and a pocket knife. Stay safe out there!
<user1> I hope that all goes well. I am sure he will be good as new after!
<user0> I'm really hoping so! I've been really worried.
<user1> I am sure the procedure will go excellently.
<user1> That's really cool! I bet people really underestimated that underdog!
<user0> I agree! I was amazed with her performance. She did really well.
<user1> That's awesome! Maybe she'll come out of her shell.
<user0> I hope so. She is very talented. Who would have known. 
<user0> He's a brave man. How was the experience?
<user1> Well the day came and off we travelled.  We arrived at the place only to find all our friends and family there to cheer us on.  Up we went in the plane and of course while the lovely instructors tried to reassure me the whole time, i tried desperately to keep my breakfast down!  However after the nerves and initial panic when we jumped out, it was actually one of the most amazing experiences of my life!
<user0> It sounds incredible! Hopefully it helped you conquer your fear!
<user1> It certainly did.  I would definitely recommend it.  My husband though is another story.  He has a fear of the sea and underwater so you can just guess what I will be buying him for his next big birthday haha.
<user1> Congratulations! Worrying about tuition is the absolute worst panic!
<user0> Yeah and its the last one before I graduate! I can be more thankful for his generosity. 
<user1> You're going to kill it this semester! You're going to be so proud when you're walking down the aisle to get handed your degree.
<user0> Thanks for the kind words. I cant be more happy and excited to be done!
<user0> Did you guys write still write notes in each others' books in high school?
<user1> Yes!  I laughed and sometimes cried a bit reading through those, especially from some old friends that are no longer with here.  It even brought up some great memories of prom and our school leaving party.
<user0> It's amazing how many feelings and memories mementos like that can bring back.
<user1> Indeed.  It definitely made my clear out day much more enjoyable.
<user1> That's awesome! Hopefully it comes back in one piece.
<user0> I agree! She will take care of it. I have faith she will bring it back the way she got it! lol
<user1> I think it will be fine. I bet the new car runs well.
<user0> Yeah it does. I never let anybody drive my car, but I felt I could let her since she is responsible. 
<user0> Im sure that is tough.  You must really miss him.
<user1> Yeah i have no pets or children so im just here in an empty house. 
<user0> Do you get nervous being on your own?
<user1> Nah just bored. Im new to this city so I dont know anybody either. 
<user0> Oh that sounds even tougher.  It is a long time but I hope it flies by for you and your hubby is back home again.
<user1> Yea I agree! II feel so helpless being home by myself. 
<user0> Im sure your not though! 
<user0> Thats horrible! Did you get the police involved?
<user1> Well yes.  While i was in my daze, absolutely horrified, my level headed husband did all the practical things like contact the police and insurance company etc.
<user0> Yeah i would have felt the same way. 
<user1> Thankfully the insurance company sorted my out with a courtesy car for now but still cant believe there are people out there that do such terrible things!
<user0> yeah it unfortunate we have to worry about things like this.
<user1> true but in time I finally did see that its not the end of the world, its just a car that can be replaced but that initial overwhelming feeling was awful.
<user1> That's a ton of traffic. I hope they finish their project soon
<user0> Me too! I get so frusterated because there are no back roads to my house so I have to go through this for the next 2 weeks. 
<user1> That's unfortunate. I wish we could fly sometimes.
<user0> Me too, so i wouldn't have to deal with wasted time!
<user0> How lovely!  I such it was so nostalgic to talk about old times together.
<user1> Yes it was. I cant wait for our reunion so we can catch up on more!
<user0> That is a brilliant idea.  There is nothing better than catching up with old friends.
<user1> Yes the things we remember and ponder about are the greatest!
<user1> Awe your such a caring and loving person! Are you going to keep it?
<user0> I didnt think I was but he has won my heart.  No one claimed him, even after posters being put around so yes he has officially become part of the family.  To be honest I was glad no owner came forward, I would never have wanted to give him up in the end he has just stolen my heart!
<user1> The love and care you show him will bring him joy and happiness! 
<user0> Just as he does to us.
<user0> Oh wow, that must've been a hard situation. Especially later when you were more in control again.
<user1> Yeah. That was the day I decided to no longer drink
<user0> That sounds like a good decision. Good luck!
<user0> What's happening this weekend? I hope you have some good things planned.
<user1> A friend that has been living overseas for the last year or so is going to come back to visit finally!
<user0> That's awesome! I'm very excited for you this is a good event for you!
<user0> That's interesting. Are you okay?
<user1> Yeah, I'm fine. My friend got into a car crash while I was in the car though.
<user0> That's bad news. I hope that everyone is healthy and doing well.
<user0> Why what happened?
<user1> I ended up getting lost for a bit in the woods which was not fun. Luckily, I made it back to my group at some point.
<user0> Oh sounds scary!  I would have been scared.
<user0> Oh no! I hope she's forgiven you since then.
<user1> oh yes she has, it was a while ago now but at the time the guilt was awful.  Needless to say I learnt my lesson and never borrowed her clothes again!
<user0> That's probably a good idea.
<user1> Yes just a pity I had to learn the hard way.
<user1> I'm sorry to hear you were upset! Why did you have to quit?
<user0> Im going back to school full time. I was there for more than 10 years. I will miss everyone. 
<user1> Wow that is a long time! Hopefully you can stay in touch with all of your former coworkers.
<user0> Yeah just thinking about it makes me want to tear up. 
<user0> hmmn, really?..i guess you must have felt very bad
<user1> I was gonna explode. Im so fed up with him. Im so done.
<user0> am so sorry about that, did he apologize?
<user1> He doesnt know I know, but he will soon when i throw his stuff out
<user1> Aww- I'm sorry that happened. Why were you embarrassed?
<user0> Well the costume itself ended up looking great, since my mom made it.  But I hadn't realized how fat I looked when i wore it, so I felt bad.
<user1> It's always difficult when you feel self-conscious - but I've learned that people rarely judge you as hard as you judge yourself. 
<user0> That's true, but no matter how much I tell myself that I always end up thinking about it too much about it.  I'm constantly worrying about what people think of me.
<user1> Please try to be kinder to yourself! You are a great person- with a lot to offer. Always remember to be good to yourself.
<user1> In reference to what?
<user0> Your trustful person?
<user1> My husband is my most trusted companion.
<user0> Oh, How much did you like him
<user0> That's horrible! I'm a parent and I could never take money from my child. Did you confront him?
<user1> i did many times, but he threatens to kick me out and ruin everything
<user0> How frustrating! Keep your head held high and be strong. One day you'll be able to keep him from taking your money.
<user0> That's really nice, however, to keep the marriage fresh and strong, I think it's important for you to have outside friends.
<user1> that's only normie talk, we are both introverted and we hate people
<user0> Haha, well I do know the feeling. I guess if it works for you, then don't change anything.
<user0> what did you do???
<user1> i builied someone because they made fun of my mother, but the person had difficulties walking already and i buillied i can't believe i did that
<user0> well im sure you'll get over it. nobody should make fun of our mothers
<user0> stay hopeful! , they'll release it sooner or later
<user1> i hope so :<
<user0> it's all gonna be fine and you'll get what u want.
<user0> That is so sweet. It is wonderful to have things that bring back these beautiful memories. 
<user1> Yeah, it is.  I always like to keep things that mean a lot to me and this was a gift from my mom so it's even more special.
<user0> That really does make it special. I'm glad you have that. 
<user0> ....what feelings? what are you talking about
<user1> she said that the elder man approached her and told her she is dumb and that made her very sad and upset
<user0> oh man, that's rough to hear from someone older than you. is she ok?
<user0> That doesn't sound very good, but jealousy is a hard thing to deal with
<user1> yeah but only i should get everything! no one else
<user0> Other people deserve to have things, too.
<user0> Oh no! When that happens you have to get up and yell, "Safe!"
<user1> indeed, but this time i was red and yelling in my head
<user0> Awww, well it happens to everyone sometimes. Just try to forget it. 
<user0> eh not really. what about you
<user1> i did, espcially today when i woke up, i realised how everything is meaningful and how i can't just waste my life chasing after money and stupid things like that, so i decided to work hard on becoming free
<user0> and what does that mean practically? what will you do differently?
<user1> i will work on the things i enjoy, which is knowledge and learning more and go for nature walks more often
<user0> i love walking in nature. hiking is a great way to exercise and to explore the outdoors
<user0> Oh it's always sad when someone you care about leaves. Can you at least keep in contact with him?
<user1> Oh yeah, we still keep in contact over the Internet daily and visit each other every few years.  But I miss when we used to hang out every day.
<user0> I know. It is hard to say goodbye to people but he is doing a wonderful thing at least. 
<user0> Everything is going to be okay. Try to relax. 
<user1> i hope so
<user0> If there is something in particular, try to deal with it head on. 
<user0> that is great.. may i know what you have learnt
<user1> I have been learning to trade on the Forex markets.
<user0> it is challenging i guess.. best wishes that you developed skill over it
<user1> Thank you sir, have a great day!
<user0> great day to you too
<user0> How hard have you been studying? Exams are extreme amounts of mental crunch time!
<user1> yup but i have been studying since for a year 
<user0> You sound very confident! I wish I had your confidence when I was in school.
<user0> I bet you will do great! What job is the interview for?
<user1> art design
<user0> That's a great field. My daughter just got a degree in art but she hasn't been able to find a job yet. Good luck tomorrow!
<user1> thank you! i have a freelaning job at art already but i just want the qualifcation for more, maybe your daughter can do the same thing
<user1> Good for you. Being prepared is always better than the alternative.
<user0> yup! defiently, i am so amazing 
<user1> Don't get too cocky but enjoy your victory you deserve it.
<user1> Oh no! You must feel really bad. Are you able to fix the problem?
<user0> no, i can't i just need to fix myself as  i am the problem
<user1> Please try not to be so hard on yourself! We all make mistakes.
<user1> Why do you need to go to the doctor?
<user0> I had a painful cyst and I knew I would have to get a needle.
<user1> Oh that's terrible. Did they take care of it?
<user1> That sounds very uncomfortable. Were you honest with them about your change of plans?
<user0> Yes. Without really giving details, I always kind of shrugged off their questions and told them that it didn't work out.
<user1> Right. 
<user1> Oh I bet that was amazing! I have a memory of going to a waterfall with my parents when I was young and it's a nice thing to think back on. Does your daughter remember it?
<user0> Yes she does. Of course she doesn't see the sentimentality of it yet as I do. She is only 23. 
<user1> One day she'll look back and it will mean so much to her! Memories with parents are the best ones.
<user1> I totally understand, I hate carnival rides too, they always feel so rickety. Do you have a particular one you fear the most?
<user0> (pressed enter too early). I love thrill rides, but i don't trust any carnival ride that gets rebuilt every time the fair opens up, too many horror stories. I mostly hate the ones that spin you a million different directions.
<user1> Agreed, a good theme park is nice because you know they have high safety standards, but those carnival ones scare the crap out of me.
<user1> Oh my goodness! That sounds awful! Was this recently?
<user0> Yes. They aren't sure what's wrong but his oxygen level is down to 40%
<user1> I'm so sorry to hear that. Hopefully he has a good team of doctors that figure out what is going on. Are y'all able to visit him?
<user1> That's so scary!  You must have strong intuition
<user0> Yeah I honestly don't but the whole mood on that highway just felt right for that to happen. A lot of people weaving and having their hazards on for no reason.
<user1> I'm so glad you came out of it okay.  I hate driving in bad weather and reckless driving just makes it worse.
<user1> It was nice of you to at least think of it. I'm sure she wasn't that upset.
<user0> I hope so, i usually hold it open for everybody but i was distracted and didn't see her.
<user1> It's totally understandable. Life can get really busy sometimes!
<user1> Oh, that's not good. Did you get a warranty for the phone?
<user0> No I usually don't since i've never dropped mines but I do get warranty now. It wasn't a cheap repair either.
<user1> I'm sorry to hear that. I hope that everything works out for you.
<user1> Did the other dog provoke him? I wouldn't stress it too much, its just natural behavior for them, take him to training school.
<user0> Not really, but he knows better. I think I will get a trainer.
<user1> Oh then yeah, invest in a trainer. I love dogs a lot but an aggressive dog is very dangerous.
<user1> Oh I'm so sorry but I bet that was very special of you to find.
<user0> Yeah sadly we don't have many videos of her but the few we have we keep them safe and stored.
<user1> I would definitely make digital copies and upload to a cloud or a disk in case something happens.
<user1> That's awesome!  Congratulations!
<user0> Yeah, i pampered myself and went with some friends to a Japanese sushi place.
<user1> Nice choice!  Getting a B is definitely something to celebrate
<user1> That's exciting!  There's nothing like listening to your favorite music with great headphones
<user0> Yeah, it really is a day and night difference. Let's you appreciate the intricacies of a song much better.
<user1> I agree 100%.  Sounds like it's time to start downloading some new tunes to test out!
<user1> Oh thats heartbreaking, do you guys already have children?
<user0> I do but she doesn't. Which makes it harder I think. All I can do is be there for her and hope time helps her heal.
<user1> I really hope she gets better too, it must be terrible to know you cant have any kids. You're a good man for helping her cope.
<user1> Young love, it's such a bittersweet quest.
<user0> It is, those were the funnest days. No responsibilities.
<user1> I know right? I wish I was young again sometimes.
<user1> It's always difficult losing a pet.  I'm sure you had a flood of positive memories and sadness than they're gone
<user0> It was very bittersweet. She could not work her legs anymore due to age.
<user1> You just have to remember what a good life she had with you!
<user1> Nice! Why do you like it more than other places you've lived?
<user0> It's my first time living in a small town. I love the fresh air. I have also met some great people.
<user1> That's good! I've always heard that people are closer friends to each other in a small town.
<user0> Either that, or people are just nosier and love getting into each other's business! Just kidding. I think the slower pace of life just makes people nicer.
<user0> That's a blessing.  I know a lot of people didn't have a mom like that.
<user1> Me too. I am so thankful for her.
<user0> Is there anything she does specifically for her?
<user0> I'm sorry. I know how that feels. Did you study really hard?
<user1> I did, but the material was a hard subject.
<user0> Oh, okay. Maybe you should ask your teacher for some extra help or find a study buddy. i hope you do better next time.
<user0> That's sweet! I have a great husband too! How long have you been married?
<user1> Just under two years. Still feel like a newlywed@
<user0> That's great! We've been married for almost 10 years and I still feel like a newlywed. It's great when you marry your best friend.
<user0> Oh gosh! That sounds frightening! Did you get out the taxi as soon as you could?
<user1> No, I just trusted him. But I wrote all his details in my phone just in case. 
<user0> Oh, well that was a smart thing to do. I would've bailed. lol
<user1> Yeah but the car was on the highway and I could not get out. Thankfully everything was alright. Never again though!
<user1> I usually love the trips down memory lane, but the sad side of it are the ones who are no longer around. I'm sorry.
<user0> It's bittersweet! Nice to see their faces again, but sad to miss them.
<user1> I'm right there with you. It makes you shed a tear sometimes too.
<user1> Oh. I know lying is sometimes beneficial in some situations. Hopefully you did this to protect someone's feelings
<user0> I just felt really bad and guilty that I did it.
<user1> Yeah, I think that means you have a conscience, which is a good thing. If you didn't feel bad, I'd worry about you!
<user1> That would make a funny video! We have a super friendly, playful cat too.
<user0> I love cats. They're so funny and such good company!
<user1> Yes, they are. He is my daughter's best friend. She can do whatever she wants and he is unphased.
<user1> That was thoughtful, sometimes i think kids fake being scared just to not be alone. hope you didn't get kicked too much!
<user0> Haha I didn't sleep a wink. He's only 8. He pretends to be all cool, but he's still very much a little kid.
<user1> Kids are interesting creatures that's for sure. I'm sure you got some cool uncle points.
<user0> I'm an auntie :p
<user1> My mistake :)
<user1> I feel the same way about my dog.  They're the greatest!
<user0> yes they are they are always happy to see you and they will always there for you
<user1> I don't know what I would do without my dog.  I'm glad you have one that's always there for you!
<user1> Nice! What did you have? I am planning to serve breakfast for dinner tonight.
<user0> Eggs, bacon, strawberries, tomatoes, and coffee. So yummy!
<user1> Mmmm. that sounds really good! I'm thinking biscuit and sausage gravy, hash brown and eggs...
<user1> I hate when that happens. I bet you meant well but you're left looking like a crazy person! I hope they understood.
<user0> They were ok with it, but I hope I didn't hurt their feelings.
<user1> I think they will get over it. Most people understood that not everyone is going to remember every little thing.
<user1> What happened? The yard always has mysteries!
<user0> My 4 year-old just dropped his pants and started peeing in the grass!
<user1> Shocking! Has your kid done that before?
<user0> No!  All of the neighbors were out there, too!
<user0> Maybe you should find him and apologize right now.
<user1> Yes maybe I should but my ego gets in the way.
<user0> You could just cook him a nice dinner or plan a special date instead. 
<user1> That is a cool idea! Thanks for the great advice! I will do that right now. :)
<user0> Your welcome! Glad I could help!
<user0> I can understand the feeling, I went through a couple of spells like that in the past. I'm sure they mean well but you're at a point where you're hurting to get back out there.
<user1> yeah! I just want to be able to support myself and not go to the food bank or rely on friends and family
<user0> You'll return to self-sufficiency soon, you just can't let yourself fall into a pit of self doubt. Stay confident.
<user0> Aww, that's so sad. I'm an animal lover so I understand the pain.
<user1> It hurts really bad and I don't know what to do. I think I should give some dogs away to a family with no small animals.
<user0> That's a really tough decision either way. I wish you the best with it and hope everything improves
<user1> Thanks for listening my friend.
<user1> Ah what a responsibly to take on! You are a great example, is it quite tough?
<user0> No. The baby bird just sleeps and eats do it is really easy. 
<user1> Alot easier than a kitten or a puppy then?
<user0> Yes! I think so, haha!
<user1> Keep up the good work!
<user1> I bet you can see the stars and hear all sorts of wildlife at night.
<user0> Oh yes. It was hard to get used to at first but now I barely notice it.
<user1> All that outside noise can become so soothing if you left it.
<user0> Yes I think so. I especially enjoy this night owl that hoo's everynight.
<user1> Living out in the woods can really make you put things in perspective too.
<user0> Sure does. Your welcome to visit any time my friend.
<user1> Thanks that is quite the offer. How kind.
<user1> Did you wait until the last minute to ask for time off?
<user0> No. My boss is not a very nice person. I think I should find a new job.
<user1> Yeah you might want to look into it then
<user0> Thanks for your advice my friend!
<user0> Oh no! Have you tried taking your dog to the vet?
<user1> I hate the vets. They charge so much money. Maybe I can google seomthing.
<user0> Yes, google has a lot of great information for pet care.
<user1> Thanks fo your advice my friend!
<user1> Well that sounds like a high stress occupation!
<user0> You think? It sure is exciting, at least when I win.
<user1> I'm glad you like it. I think it would be hard to get it right every time the way the market is sometimes.
<user0> Your right. Let's see how I do next week.
<user1> I wish you the very best with it all!
<user0> Thanks my friend!
<user1> You're welcome. Be careful not to chase stocks too hard, they don't always turn the way you might hope!
<user1> I don't know what you can do. A duck is just a toy that taste good to a dog.
<user0> I scream at the dogs and it seems to be working but I never know what can happen in the future.
<user1> Dogs gonna do dog stuff. That's just how they do.
<user0> Yep. Talk to later my friend.
<user0> That would be bad you should double check before you leave
<user1> I feel I can't fit anything else in my suitcase so I think I have it all. But I will double check like you said. :)
<user0> Yeah it is better to be safe than sorry
<user1> You are so right! See you when I get back my friend!
<user1> Why were you ashamed? Did she disturb the neighbors or something?
<user0> Yes, my neighbors were very angry.
<user1> I'm sorry that happened. You might need to get her obedience training,
<user1> Thats awesome! do yall have any plans? 
<user0> We are just going to hang out on the farm and hang out with the cows, ha ha
<user1> lol maybe yall could find something to bond over
<user0> We have a great relationship so just each others company is good enough.
<user0> Yeah we dont thinnk about how special it was until it is gone
<user1> It is so true. We take it for granted. I wish I knew then what I know now.
<user0> Yeah we all do but we can only go forward
<user1> Very true my friend.
<user1> Have you taken her to the vet?
<user0> No. There are no vets where I live. I gave her some medicine though but nothing seems to be working.
<user1> You might want to look up what is going on online
<user0> That is a good idea. I will take a look. Thanks my friend.
<user0> That sucks. Next time they should tell you instead of laughing!
<user1> well looking back its funny, but man, yesterday i wished i could hide, plus I think my boss seen it too
<user0> I'm sure it's not so bad. At least you can laugh about it now!
<user0> That is great! you should celebrate and enjoy this momment
<user1>  I already have plans to go out to a nice restaurant and celebrate with my family
<user0> that is good! I hope you enjoy yourself
<user0> Awesome! What's it about?
<user1> its about how some customers are not choosing our slow moving products. i have been working on it for weeks. i got it nailed down
<user0> Congrats! I hope it goes well. Are you presenting to a board of directors?
<user0> Maybe you can save more and be able to get one.
<user1> its not just that, this neighbor is always buying expensive things and likes to show them off
<user0> Man that gets to me when someone does that , like they are better than everyone else.
<user0> The holidays are a great time for that sort of thing. What did your family do together?
<user1> just the normal stuff,  but the kids are all grown up.Holidays are never the same without having kids around to enjoy it
<user0> I understand what you mean.  I hope you and your family are all able to get together and enjoy each other's company soon.
<user0> I hope you can have you applied or did you interview already?
<user1> i have interview for it and thinking i might get it but you never know
<user0> well have you practiced interviewing? With that you can feel so much better!
<user0> I'm sorry to hear that. Hopefully something better is coming along for you soon.
<user1> thank you, i was really depending on this promotion
<user0> Keep working hard and I think your efforts will eventually be noticed.
<user0> Ah that always sucks, did she need to go out or is she sick or something?
<user1> i don't know, she never did that before, i don't know if the crap or her behavior got to me more
<user0> Well it isn't as if she did it on purpose dogs always have a reason.
<user0> Oh no, is it painful and disrupting you in anyway? 
<user1> its painful but the thought of it being pulled kind of freaks me out plus the cost of it.
<user0> Yeah, I know what you mean it does sound very scary, but they do numb your face and usually they do not pull it out, they fill in the cavity! 
<user0> What did you do?
<user1> Well, plans got changed.  It rained like crazy, so we couldn't work outside.
<user0> It has been raining a lot here too. Definitely ruins a weekend planned outside of the house.
<user1> It was okay, though. We got to spend some time hanging out and had a low-key weekend.
<user0> That's good, sometimes it's good to just be lazy inside the house.
<user0> so are you making him a gift?
<user1> Yeah, we're rebuilding a porch swing for him.  But I've had to hunt down some tooling.
<user0> don't worry about it you will get it done and he will be proud of it
<user1> Thanks, I hope so!
<user1> Do you have a general fear of flying, or is there something about this trip?
<user0> it s the fear of flying, just the thought of it frightens me
<user1> Have you always had a fear of flying?  I haven't ever really feared it, but I don't like it.
<user1> Was it another boring day today? 
<user0> Well, it sort of turned out that way.  There was a big event at work today, and I wasn't sure how it would go.
<user1> Ohh okay I see, yeah I always get excited when new things happen at work too. 
<user1> I know the feeling. Hang in there! tomorrow is always a new day 
<user0> you know the worst part of it, is that i hid it from my partner who is proud of me dieting, i feel bad for it
<user1> Did you hide the wrappers?
<user1> There's very few brands I feel that strongly about. What kind of yogurt is it, I might want to try it?
<user0> Astro balkan plain! It's not as pastey as greek yogurt, or runny like other kinds
<user1> I don't think I have ever seen that kind in the store, I'll have to look for it next time I go. I don't care much for the runny yogurt, but I like greek yogurt so long as it's whole fat and sweet.
<user1> That is horrible. Americas government wont be of help....hopefully you have family?
<user0> No I'm all by myself
<user1> No cat or dog?
<user1> Yes I love animals and have 3 dogs right now.
<user0> Well then you will understand the love I had for my pitbull named Lily.   We had a special bond and when she died it broke my heart.  Never leave a candle burning and leave the house.   OUr house burned and she died of smoke inhalation.  I will never forget her!
<user1> I'm sorry that happened to you and I will take your advice.
<user1> That sounds super scary, could he tell that your were scared or nervous? How did you escape that situation?
<user0> I shrank into myself and prayed for the car to go faster and not crash
<user1> Oh wow, it's fortunate that you managed to get out of that situation alive. I'm glad you made it out of that awful situation. 
<user1> That sounds a little scary. Why was he running towards your car?
<user0> He wanted money!
<user1> Did you give him any?
<user0> NO!
<user0> Aww, I am sorry, but I must say Pirate peanut butte cookies do sound good, did they help you feel any better?
<user1> In the short term, yes! They're oatmeal and peanut butter
<user0> Ugh, that sounds wonderful, I would do the same if I were stressed I think
<user0> That's amazing. Were you impressed?
<user1> Yes, he did it perfectly and did not hurt himself
<user0> That must take a lot of practice. I can't even juggle safe objects so I'd likely lose an arm if I tried to juggle chainsaws lol
<user0> Me, too!  I work at the registration department at a college and we're very busy until school starts.
<user1> There's just something so nostalgic about going to school. Reminds me of my childhood.
<user0> I think it's the feeling of the beginning of something new.
<user0> Wow that is so sweet of her. She must really love you! 
<user1> I hope so! She always helps me and one day I will return the favor!
<user0> Wow that is fantastic, she is so lucky to have you around because you are such a sweet and caring person. :) 
<user0> Good for you friend! I'm sure you'll find something soon. What field of work do you want to be in?
<user1> I work in video production. Super fun job, but I'm tired of the freelance life.
<user0> That does sound like a really fun job. I also work freelance and would also like something more stable. 
<user0> Oh no, they went on vacation without you?? 
<user1> Yes, I had to work and could not get time off!
<user0> Oh no that sucks, I am sorry that you had to stay home alone. What did you do to entertain yourself? 
<user0> Oh no, I am so sorry to hear that. How are you holding up? 
<user1> I am doing okay, my cat was old and is probably in a better place now :'(
<user0> Yes, I am sure that your cat is in a better place. If you ever want to talk to someone about it I am always here to listen. :) 
<user0> The big one? The bar? That's a whole lot of schooling and effort culminating in to one test! I imagine you're very excited, but anxious too.
<user1> Luckily not the bar yet! Just the end of summer class.
<user0> Ahh. Still, another stone set on the road to payoff. I wish you the best!
<user0> You study hard?
<user1> I did. Failed my last so I knew I had to make it right.
<user0> Oh no, I bet you aced this one then.
<user0> Oh no, have you talked to him about it? 
<user1> Yes! He is such a manchild! He does not care about cleanliness!
<user0> Aww man, that sucks, I am guessing that you end up having to do all the dirty work because he has been slacking off. 
<user0> Oh I would be pissed. Hopefully you had more so you could fix another plate.
<user1> I did, but he knows better.
<user0> Guessing he didn't get anymore food for dinner lol.
<user0> I'd imagine so. What a great time of our lives college can be. The world just seems right, being surrounded by your peers, all sharing similar goals. 
<user1> It was so great. We all just wanted to learn.
<user0> Mmhm. I wish I studied more, paid more attention, and joined more clubs. But I guess that's the thing, you're already as busy as it gets, and unfortunately you can't experience it all.
<user0>  That is great, confidence is always a key in success! I believe that you will pass as well! 
<user1> Thank you. I'm ready for it to be over with.
<user0> Yeah I bet! You will do great, I have high hopes in you! :) 
<user0> Aw, that stinks. Why couldn't they come?
<user1> My dad had to work last minute. I got everything ready for them. Oh well.
<user0> That sounds really disappointing. Hopefully, you'll be able to see them soon! I'm sure they were excited too.
<user0> Oh man, I bet you did. I would have had a gag reflex if I saw some one puking at the bar. 
<user1> They couldn't even make it to the bathroom. Ugh.
<user0> Wow they must have had 1 too many drinks if they could not even get to the bathroom. I am sorry you had to see such a disgusting sight 
<user0> Me too, it's so hard not knowing what to expect.
<user1> And we do not even know if we have an afterlife.
<user0> Right, no one truly knows until they get there, so scary.
<user0> What was the book about?
<user1> It was about the golden state killer. Very errie.
<user0> I'm glad you were happy reading the book.
<user0> Oh, I understand. I also remember mine. Do you remember something else about that day?
<user1> I could not find my classes. It was almost comical.
<user0> I imagine it was a big college. what did happen at the end?
<user0> Me too! I love that game!
<user1> Yup, I did it in my first try too!
<user0> I saw a machine one time that you could win live lobsters. They would cook it for you if you won.
<user0> Nice! How long has it been since you last saw her?
<user1> 6 months. Way too long!
<user0> Man, I hope you two do something fun!
<user0> All spiders or just the poisonous ones?
<user1> Any of them. I hate all their creepy legs.
<user0> Thats fair I guess, weird fish freak me out more then spiders through
<user0> Wow, is she an older or younger sibling? 
<user1> She is 10 years younger than I am, and quite spoiled.  She always has the  nicest things.
<user0> Aww man that sucks, One day your hard work will pay off, so don't let it get to you too much. I am sure she is not intentially doing that
<user0> omg! I hate cockroaches, they are ugly insects 
<user1> Yes! they are so creepy with how fast and nasty they are1
<user0> were you able to kill it? what did you do?
<user1> I sprayed it with Raid
<user0> Well done. I hope you dont find anymore, they are scary. 
<user0> Wow! that is really cool. Did he land the back flip?
<user1> He did! I didn't know he could do that.
<user0> What prompted his back flip?
<user0> It happens sometimes.  It only becomes a problem if you forget often.
<user1> Luckily I have not done it too many times.
<user0> I hope they were pretty understanding.
<user0> I hate burger king! McD's all the way
<user1> Your dam right! Even if the food is small, it tastes so good!
<user0> Adding mac sauce to a cheeseburger is a game changer
<user0> That is unfortunate, did you fail the test?
<user1> Not exactly, but close enough. I will study better next time.
<user0> You got this! I believe in you!
<user0> Wow! Did you tell them anything?
<user1> I did a few days later. They seemed sorry.
<user0> You should stop being their friend!
<user0> Oh, snitches are no fun.
<user1> Yes, snitches get stiches
<user0> I would just keep to myself.
<user0> Who?
<user1> Oh so sorry, I meant to say I didnt treat my mother as well as I should have.  I often treated her with disrespect and disobedience.
<user0> Well I think as long as you say sorry, she can forgive.
<user0> I know how annoying that can be.  I love dogs but they certainly get do annoying things at times.
<user1> I still do not know why he was barking.
<user0> Maybe there was something outside or maybe he just wanted attention.   Dogs behavior can be hard to figure out sometimes.   Good Luck!
<user0> I have done that before. It is not fun.
<user1> Yup! I had to walk home in shame!
<user0> I hope you threw out those pants.
<user0> Ooh, what kind of trick did she learn?
<user1> shaking hands! so cute
<user0> Aww! I wish I had a dog now!
<user0> American football or soccer?
<user1> american football!
<user0> Okay. I'm not really a fan of it.
<user0> Yeah, that was a surprising result.
<user1> I still do not know what to make of it
<user0> Does it make you feel like you're living in an alternate reality?
<user0> it can be scary at times. How do you deal with it?
<user1> I try to go to bed earlier.
<user0> That is a good way. I have a dog that makes me feel safe. Do you have anything like that?
<user0> You can watch some movies
<user1> What should I watch?
<user0> It depends on your preference. I watch korean dramas.
<user0> Life is always a lot better when the sun is shining.
<user1> Yes, I appreciate everything, even the sun 
<user0> When the sun is shining walking and seeing the beautiful sights makes me smile.
<user0> That is good you have someone to share your happiness and problems with
<user1> It is. Do you?
<user0> my best friend is my boyfriend. So I share everything with him
<user0> Same here! where do you volunteer at?
<user1> The humane society. I just love animals.
<user0> That is so generous of you! have you ever thought of joining a volunteer organization?
<user0> what are those
<user1> It is a terrible disease where your ankles and calves are fused together
<user0> ??? is it a cancer of some sort??
<user0> That is excellent! I wish I had the courage to do so, too. 
<user1> You should try! It is fun!
<user0> I think it would be fun to help someone build a house.
<user0> oh yeah? was it because you didn't know if you could do the work, or because of all the hot college girls
<user1> Just nervous for new beginnings.
<user0> well how did it go? did you do well?
<user0> That must be nice. I wish i had one.
<user1> You should! They need a lot of attention though!
<user0> Yes, they do. And lots of care.
<user0> What about it made you feel nervous?
<user1> just nervous for a new start in life
<user0> Yeah I understand. Big life changes make me feel uneasy sometimes too.
<user1> just nervous for a new start
<user1> I lost my dog last year, I miss her too. 
<user0> Dogs are too good to us
<user1> I agree, they are the best. 
<user1> That must feel good.
<user0> Yes, I am starting to appreciate lots of small things in life!
<user1> Small things like what?
<user1> Wow thats completely unfair!
<user0> Yup, it scarred me for life. I have mental issues now
<user1> Well i mean sounds like favortism to me. Siblings always get the better things 
<user1> Wow, lucky you. I play those once in a year only
<user0> I can understand that, as I usually dont have the money to play to very often.  I couldnt wait to go cash it in.  
<user1> I do not play too much because if I do not win, I feel it is a waste of money.
<user1> well that's good. what's the subject?
<user0> Organic chemistry!
<user1> I hate chemistry because I think we should leave all that stuff to nature and just live our lives as the animals we are
<user0> I agree!
<user1> do you have a good teacher?
<user1> Wow that is annoying. Did you get a spicy packet after?
<user0> No, I was pouting all day! 
<user1> That is okay, mistakes happen all the time.
<user1> Did you drink a lot of coffee when you were a child?
<user0> No, but I like losing myself in my thoughts when drinking coffee!
<user1> I see, that is such a nice way to remember your past,.
<user1> Well did you pass or did you fail?
<user0> I failed unfortunately, but I liked my optimism!
<user1> Well I guess you might want to study harder next time.
<user1> oh you must love getting cancer results!
<user0> Well it does get my heart beating fast!
<user1> that's why I do it, for a great cardio workout. so what were the results?
<user1> and then what happened??
<user0> I woke up
<user1> and then what happened
<user1> I hope something good was on
<user0> There was! But I felt so bad afterwards. I'm a monster
<user1> yeah you are. what show was it?
<user1> Really? what kind of icecream?
<user0> A plain vanilla one. It is rare since their machine is always broken!
<user1> That is a good one! it is not always broken though. Sometimes they are out of ice cream mix because the workers eat it all
<user1> That is a rational fear when you are little. How did you overcome it?
<user0> I became depressed and I felt nothing
<user1> Oh that is a bad place to go
<user1> Oh really? What were you guys talking about?
<user0> About topics that really impressed us. It was you <3
<user1> Aww that's so sweet <3
<user1> He must be a good person bit if he's a stranger, is it safe?
<user0> It was super creepy, I did not take the offer !
<user1> That is good safety first
<user1> I am sorry to hear that! what was its name?
<user0> I called him Pizza Guy
<user1> That is cute! is there a meaning behind that name?
<user1> That is good! Never accept anything less!
<user0> Exactly,you receive what you get. Nothing less.
<user1> I'm rooting for you! Get your dream person!
<user1> I can imagine how it feel,more so if its someone who never leaves his/her phone down.
<user0> Yes, I do not like being ignored >:(
<user1> The writing is very clear on the wall. You have been ignored.
<user1> Wow, that sounds intense! I hope you'll find out there was nothing to be stressed about after all!
<user0> yeah but i hate having mean teachers , the ones that are not open for different ways of explaining things. so i really hope i won't have anyone like that
<user1> Well I hope you won't have any of those mean teachers! Maybe you'll have some awesome ones?
<user1> that's sounds amazing, you
<user0> Yes, me very happy!
<user1> you didn't talk to any of them during summer break? is there anyone specific you're looking forward to see?
<user1> I feel you. I am still scared even though I am sort of successful now!
<user0> it's that fear of not being able to control everything that hurts the most
<user1> Uncertainty is the only certainty!
<user1> Have you always felt that way or have changed your view over time?
<user0> That is just me,we seem to get a lot of things done within a short period of time.
<user1> Well that is a good way of doing things as long are you getting the job right in my opinion.
<user1> Yes I believe in you
<user0> thank you, i'm believe in myself and all the hard work i put in this project
<user1> Your hard work will not fail you
<user1> I'm so sorry. : ( 
<user0> To make it worse,i was the one on the wrong. The insurance is seeming difficult to compensate.
<user1> Well, at least you came out without an injury? Or did you.
<user1> Dang! What are going to do with all that free time!?
<user0> The plan is to just relax. Maybe some TV or a book.
<user1> Nice! Well I hope you have a nice and relaxing weekend!
<user1> Oh my god, that sounds like the most terrifying thing ever! Where was this so I know never to go there?
<user0> It was at Mcdonalds!
<user1> Not surprising. How long did it take you before you were able to eat a burger again?
<user1> what kind of promises? who hurt you?
<user0> nobody hurted me , it's just seeing people get hurt is kind of annoying for me
<user1> what is the worst hurt you've ever seen?
<user0> nobody hurted me , it's just seeing people get hurt is kind of annoying for me
<user1> so I hear....
<user1> Wow that sounds like good news!
<user0> Yeah. He was going to college. He went for a couple years. He didn't finish there. 
<user1> I'm glad to hear he has moved on with his life! A huge step forward.
<user1> Wait, you forgot you're vegetarian? That must've been pretty shocking
<user0> My girlfriend makes me! And she is always watching!
<user1> Oooo you have to be sneaky with your meat habits, my friend
<user1> Who have you helped recently?
<user0> well, i always help this old man to cross the road.
<user1> That's really kind of you. Does the old man appreciate it?
<user0> well you see, i do it more for myself , i don't really mind if the other people appreciate it or not it's more for me to be a better person.
<user1> You are a good example to others.
<user1> Sounds like a great friend! Do they just listen or offer helpful advice?
<user0> I usually ask her for advice and tell her embarrassing stories because she never snitches!
<user1> Loyal and caring. You've got a winner on your hands!
<user1> good to know. and what makes you life so good, huh?
<user0> Family is doing great, bussines is booming
<user1> what if it all comes crashing down on you!
<user1> Did your mother find out?
<user0> No, but the guilt haunted me for a long time!
<user1> How have you managed it? Have you thought about returning to the store and admitting to it?
<user1> That sounds unfair. Maybe you'll get another chance to win.
<user0> The funny part was I threw the baton at the end and got my team disqualified for the race.
<user1> Oh wow, well there is always another chance, we all learn on mistakes.
<user1> I am not much of a gamer myself. What is your favourite game?
<user0> My favorite game is Assassin's Creed.  It has a great story.  When I see it running on a gamer's expensive PC I wish I could get that performance.
<user1> You need to save your money to be able to afford it.
<user1> I can sympathize with you. I've had a lot of betrayal in the past. The ONLY thing to do is to continue looking for trustworthy individuals. 
<user0> I have learnt the hard way,keep your friend circle small.
<user1> Not for naught but, a dog won't ever betray you <3
<user1> oh my god, did it take a lot of work? and did it annoy you when it fell down?
<user0> Yes it took me over an hour! I was so mad!
<user1> maybe this time you can do it somewhere alone?
<user1> Same. I hate my life. I sit in front of my computer all day
<user0> i do too, it's normal to runaway and sit in front of your computer i guess
<user1> Well I hope things turn out better for you
<user1> why do you do it?
<user0> i don't do it on purpose , it's them they want me to be a doctor but i don't like medicine.
<user1> oh I see. what do you want to do instead?
<user1> That's unfortunate. Did you make up afterwards?
<user0> no, she still doesn't want to apologise for what she did, but eve she doesn't i'm gonna talk to her today!
<user1> That's good. You guys are siblings after all and should try to get along.
<user1> hi, what makes you think that?
<user0> Bruh,my instincts can't be wrong. I just have this crazy feeling that i might be lucky this time round.
<user1> fair enough my friend, would you say your chances are high because of signs of other people winning around you recently?
<user1> Could she just be too distraught to pick up a phone? I agree that she owes that much to you but, maybe shes too broken atm
<user0> i got really angry and i'm so worried about my father. so i'm gonna go visit my parents and check on them this weekend.
<user1> Hopefully you don't live too far. I know this is a random chat but, I genuinely hope your father is okay. I don't have a dad so, cherish every moment you get.
<user1> Golf is by far my favourite hobby, this sounds awesome! What island was it?
<user0> Caye Caulker. Maybe a vacation for your partner. There's a snorkeling place there. The coolest things though was that it was unlike anywhere I've ever been.
<user1> I will have a look at it on my lunch break today! I did snorkelling in the Philippines at it was amazing.  That was on the island of Coron
<user1> Ooooof lmao do you work in an office?
<user0> Yeah, insurance. No client though thankfully.
<user1> Thank goodness. You really dodged a bullet on that one
<user1> oh boy oh boy oh boy where are you going??
<user0> i'm going to Greece. i can't wait to see all the greek gods up close.
<user1> well, I don't want to break it to you, but those guys are fictional....
<user1> Did the secret negatively affect others?
<user0> No, but some kind person came up to me and promised not to tell anybody.
<user1> I can understand that feeling. Well, if it was pretty innocuous there's no harm and keeping confidentialiy
<user1> Oh wow more responsibility! I bet the pay raise will be welcome
<user0> Yes, a couple more levels and it will be easier.
<user1> Sweet! Sounds like a good job. How are the bosses?
<user1> thats a wonderful thing how long have you been married?
<user0> for over 5 years now. 
<user1> very nice its always good to find a faithful and loving woman
<user1> we all make mistakes , what's important is to learn from them! and you were young so it's okay you know?
<user0> yeah it was something a stupid kid does, I went into a comic book store with a friend and tried to steal a lot of comics but we were caught and I learned it was bad to steal
<user1> it's good that you learned from your mistake!
<user1> That's awesome! Tell me about her.
<user0> i've been with her for 10 years and she's wonderful mother and wife and always puts her family first
<user1> Aw, that's great to hear about happy marriages! I hope you tell her often how much you appreciate her!  I'm sure you're a great husband too.
<user1> Oh no! Did someone let it out?
<user0> They must have. I couldn't believe what I was seeing...
<user1> How old was he?
<user0> 10, I had him for 10 years.
<user0> Oh no, I am so sorry to hear that. It's stressful. I hope your job is safe?
<user1> mine is good, i just feel bad for the people who got fired you know?
<user0> Totally. I can't imagine losing my job. Luckily the economy is pretty good, so maybe they will find new jobs quickly. 
<user0> Why are you moving?
<user1> well, my university is in a different city so i'm leaving everyone here to follow my dreams.
<user0> I would feel emotional too with such a big transition in life. I am sure you will enjoy university though
<user0> were they close to you? 
<user1> I was really close with my Grandpa on my father's side. I used to spend every summer with them when I was as child 
<user0> that makes sense why you got upset but in the end we're all gonna follow them and you never now you may see them again
<user0> That is so heartwarmingly sweet. I know exactly how you feel since my family means the world to me as well.
<user1> they are my reason to live for sure, I don't look forward to my kids growing up and moving out
<user0> It's true they grow up so fast. This is why we should appreciate every second we have with them.
<user0> What do you do?
<user1> I am a project manager. I started off very junior, and now I have worked my way up in the company
<user0> Oh wow- Do you have a college degree?
<user0> Why do you find it hard to throw away old stuff
<user1> Just thinking of all the good times I had with toys / books etc when I was a child! Even though I wouldn't use these things again, it was still hard to throw away 
<user0> So what are you planning to do
<user1> I ended up giving it to charity - that way someone else can have good times with them! 
<user1> Oh no, I've had that happen before, it is the worst. I hope it wasn't too bad for you!
<user0> It  wasn't that bad in the end, but it was the fear of not remembering anything! 
<user1> I understand that all too well! I'm glad it wasn't too bad though. I've had some pretty embarrassing things happen while hungover.
<user1> did you apologise to him? maybe next time try to not drink a lot so you can control yourself?
<user0> I did apologise to him the next day, and I had a lot of making up to do. I don't usually get nasty when I drink alcohol, but this has made me be more careful 
<user1> i'm glad it made you more aware of what you're doing.
<user1> What are you going to do to change that?
<user0> Keep doing my best in whatever i do. I'm sure all shall be well.
<user1> Keep your head up high, good positive thinking.
<user1> What did you do to it?
<user0> I took it home with me, I felt bad for it.
<user1> You are such a sweet soul. They say adopt and rescue ,don't buy
<user1> I wish I could have heard your speech. it must have been really funny.
<user0> I don't think anybody recorded it which is a shame! My Dad loved it though which is the main thing 
<user1> I hope he had a wonderful wedding. He must have been proud of you.
<user1> Did you get the job? Or you're still waiting on the response?
<user0> I did get the job - the company were really impressed with my knowledge of what they did, and my enthusiasm for the role 
<user1> You must be really proud of yourself. That sounds really fulfilling!
<user1> well if this isn't a great start for summer i don't know what is
<user0> I wouldn't change a thing in the world right now.
<user1> of course you won't, have an amazing summer!
<user1> Oh it can really hurt
<user0> At least it wasn't with a close friend - it was someone I didn't know. At least i didn't have to be angry with 2 people i knew! 
<user1> Its fair that way
<user1> Oh no, I am sorry to hear that. You must be very worried about her!
<user0> Worried least to say,teenage pregnancy with not best formal education. I'm lost for words.
<user1> Oh gosh, all you can do is try to be there for her.  But yes, 14 is so young to be a mother. I'd be very upset too. I'm sorry.
<user1> Must have really brought back good memories. I love nostalgia.
<user0> It's great! I'm really looking forward to playing the new Spyro games too!
<user1> It's a great thing these companies are doing letting you re-live the good old days when you're older!
<user1> Oh no, how embarassing! Did anyone see? 
<user0> Yes! There was like 12 people near me! I couldn't believe my luck.
<user1> I hate it when that happens! I hope you didn't hurt yourself, and that somebody tried to help? 
<user1> How did it eventually go?
<user0> I got the good response I was anticipating. I put a lot of work into my CV, and the application, so I was very happy with the result 
<user1> Congratulations on a new job
<user1> Oh no, I am sorry to hear that. That really sucks, maybe you can reapply soon?
<user0> I suppose I could, but I'm not sure I want to apply again as they didn't treat with any respect, and ignored my application 
<user1> I can understand that. I think the next company you apply for will be your time to shine!
<user1> Oh no! I confess I have done that to my kids!
<user0> I have too now that I have kids of my own!! I think that the use by dates on food are more of a guideline, and so far they haven't got ill! 
<user1> Ha, that's good! Mine haven't gotten sick from it either. I just hate to waste food!
<user1> Amazing, did you revise for it, or are you naturally clever? 
<user0> I studied all week for it. I came prepared.
<user1> That's cool - I never had the concentration to study that much 
<user1> Oh man, I would have moved out the next day.
<user0> Yeah it wasn't long before I did move out! I never believed in ghosts until then, and it still creeps me out! 
<user1> I don't blame you. I've never seen one before, I'd hate to see one.
<user1> Oh no. May I ask what you did wrong?
<user0> I got caught drinking under age. I got off without being charged, but it was very scary! 
<user1> Where did they take you? Back to your parents or to the police station?
<user0> They took me back to my parents, but I think they just wanted to give me a bit of a scare! 
<user1> Did it work? Did you ever do it again?
<user0> I didn't do it for a long time, but I eventually did as I got a bit older 
<user1> Well try to stay out of trouble now you are a bit older!
<user1> were you happy for him? or did you get sad because you didn't want that to happen?
<user0> I was delighted for him, his new wife is so great for him, and she's always been really cool to me 
<user1> that's great, i'm glad she's nice to you.
<user1> That's wonderful news, congratulations! Are you going to celebrate?
<user0> I am definitely going to celebrate! It is my dream job 
<user1> I am so happy for you. You should get a nice dinner with your family.
<user1> did he find out?
<user0> He did eventually, I actually told him when the guilt got too much for me 
<user1> thats good you told him. Thats a lot to keep inside. Hopefully he wasnt mad
<user1> Ohhhh, that is so bad. Why did you cheat?
<user0> I got drunk - i felt really guilty about it
<user1> Oh no, sorry about that. But have you confessed to her
<user1> well that's great news congratulations, how long have you known each other?
<user0> We have known each other for 7 years, and been dating for 5 - felt like the right time
<user1> that's good that you put a lot of effort into it
<user1> haha, amazing! did you get shouted at?
<user0> No but a lot of people saw me do it and my face went beet red
<user1> That's really embarassing! did any of your friends poke fun at you for it? 
<user1> What happened exactly? Is it just old and moldy?
<user0> no its just 17 years old and needs to be replaced
<user1> At least you got your moneys worth! Are you going to have it installed?
<user1> That is so lovely
<user0> yes I had a good childhood with wonderful memories even though we didn't have a lot of money
<user1> Memories are good to be kept in the medulla. Good old days. You really had a good time
<user1> Aw. When you know, you know. How did you do it?
<user0> I was rather cheesy and proposed to her on christmas 
<user1> I bet it was really special though! Christmas is such a beautiful time of year. When are you getting married?
<user1> That's too bad. Do you have proof of infidelity?
<user0> Not really, but my one boyfriend was always very flirty and liked hooking up with girls a lot
<user1> It's good that you're faithful. Too bad your boyfriend couldn't be less flirtatious and respect you more.
<user1> What kind of food does it serve? Sounds wonderful!
<user0> It is a Spanish restaurant, and they serve Steaks and Fish chargrilled. It is my new favourite place to eat! 
<user1> Surf and turf! That's what they called a steak served with seafood. It's very yummy!
<user1> That's good, I love relaxing outside by a pool.
<user0> Yeah it was like I had no stress.
<user1> That's always a good feeling.
<user1> oh man dogs are crazy! My dog killed a cat recently, I hope it's not poison!! Is he okay?
<user0> He seems to be ok but if he start salivating then for sure there is poison. I will have to run to vet!!
<user1> oh no, you are a good dog owner though
<user0> Thanks! I think I am if I save his life. :)
<user0> Sounds like you are doing all the right things. Did anything go wrong?
<user1> no it took 2 weeks to close and no issues came up
<user0> Oh that is great! Congratulations on your knew home! That must be so exciting!
<user0> that's the coolest thing ever I didn't know you could have them as pets
<user1> Oh yes! I have 3 adult females and one male. I have had them for 5 years. They have names and I can call them and they come running to me. They are cool pets.
<user0> My kids would love something like that
<user1> Your neighbors can complain sometimes if they don't like noise. They can be noisy in mating season.
<user1> Monkeys!!!??? I have never heard monkeys howl.  Tell me more.
<user0> It is hard to give you an example through text but it does sound like a monster in the mountains. Kind of scary! haha
<user1> Where do you live that there are monkeys in the mountains?  I live in Florida, the flatlands. lol
<user0> I live in Florida too but have a second home in Mexico. They are in the jungles and are wild there.
<user1> Sounds exciting.  But I would have been scared of howling monkeys too.  I am not sure why, but the term "howling monkeys" makes me giggle.
<user0> Haha, It is a funny situation. Chat with you later my friend!
<user1> Bye! Watch out for those monkeys!
<user1> oh that is so exciting!!! good for you man!
<user0> thanks, i thing I am going to celebrate when I get home tonight
<user1> yeah pop that champagne!
<user1> That sounds awesome! What's your favorite part of your vacation so far?
<user0> I love hiking through the rice fields and the fruit here is out of this world!!
<user1> What kinds of fruit do they have there?
<user0> It is all tropical fruit like mangoes, jackfruit and durian. Lots of new interesting tastes.
<user0> That's great that they let you work in exchange for lessons. I bet you have the best memories.
<user1> Yes I have very fond memories from those days.  I can still remember the smell of the farm and the smell of horses like it was yesterday.  I never wanted to wash the smell from my hands and I would daydream about owning my own horse someday.
<user0> That's awesome. Do you own a horse now?
<user0> That's awesome! Yeah I definitely find the more I study, the better I do. Funny how that works! 
<user1> Yeah, but theres a balance. study too much and you just burn yourself out
<user0> True. There has to be a work/school/life balance. 
<user0> Well I hope he gets to felling better.
<user1> He's better already but he got a real bad fever during that week
<user0> You should keep an eye on him older people are more prone to getting sick.
<user0> That's very considerate of you. I know some people that drink it all and don't replace it.
<user1> Yeah, I have done that before and I got yelled at by everyone. I learned my lesson. Haha
<user0> Lol it happens, what's important is that you learned and care enough about your people to internalize the knowledge.
<user0> Awww, I never had one, but wanted one.
<user1> Yeah i had good memories playing with my friends
<user0> What were your favorite games?
<user1> for sure need for speed underground, loved that game
<user1> Wow, thats terrible. Did you get him to pay you all back?
<user0> No, he cut off all communication. Nobody liked him anyways, he was dirty and rude.
<user1> Well good riddance. If you never want to see scum again, just loan them $20.
<user1> I'm sorry. It sucks when you put time and effort into studying but the grade is bad. Could you get help from your teacher or a study buddy?
<user0> Yea i had a study group I just panicked when i entered the testing room i think. It's not so bad though, i still passed the class.
<user1> Well that's good news. I hope you do better on your next test.
<user1> Aw, I know that must be hard having to take care of yourself so far from loved ones that you can depend on.
<user0> Yes it is quite hard. But it has been my choice to move away. I guess one day I will return but not sure when.
<user1> That's good that you are keeping your options open and even better that you challenged yourself to leave comfort and travel.
<user0> Yeah that is my personality for sure. At least I will have lots of stories to tell one day! 
<user0> Oh no! that's horrifying in high school! I hope you didn't get made fun of.
<user1> One of the bully kids noticed the sweater around my waste on the warm day and knew something was up. He really tried to embarrass me.
<user0> Kids can be so mean. Thank God that's all behind us now!
<user0> Holy crap! Is there not a landlord or something you can complain to?
<user1> I can but they take forever to come and clean it up. I just talked to the guy who did it and he said he won't do it again. Spent  an hour cleaning it all up with a lot of clorox, alcohol, and soap.
<user0> I'm glad I never had to live with other people. I would not be as patient as you.
<user0> Did you pass?
<user1> Yeah, got a 73% on the class. Not ideal but better than failing.
<user0> Absolutely. Great job!
<user0> I completely agree, having complete control over your diet is amazing and has a ton of benefits
<user1> It's easier to maintain than people realize!
<user0> Yeah, and it can be cost effective if you plan wisely!
<user0> Oh my goodness! That is scary! Are you alright? Did anyone get hurt?
<user1> Yeah im alright, i was far enough to steer clear of the chaos. The guy that flipped had to get carried by ambulance, but he didn't look very injured. and the other guy was ok.
<user0> Whew! You are lucky! Glad to hear everyone was ok. 
<user0> Oh no, poor dog :( I'd be devastated too, i love dogs so much.
<user1> My heart is broken and I can't stop crying. I feel so helpless that I could not save her. 
<user0> Don't beat yourself up over it, it was a very tragic accident but who could've known. He's in a better place now.
<user0> That was nice of her. Did everything work out?
<user1> No, she forgot.  Which, unfortunately, is typical!
<user0> Oh no! Did you guys stillhave a nice evening?
<user1> Yeah, it worked out okay to take the kids with. It just wasn't quite as relaxing.
<user0> Yeah I thought of that. well, the kids probably loved it!
<user1> Yeah, they hate leaving mama!  They can take or leave daddy.
<user1> Very nice.  How many shoes do you have?
<user0> i have around 7 right now
<user1> Are they all Yeezys?
<user0> No, mainly adidas Ultraboosts and nike
<user0> That sounds so nice!  Are you very far from grocery stores and stuff?
<user1> Only about a 30 minute drive. Not to close and not to far. But we grow some of our food here and we have cows and chickens too.
<user0> Yeah, that's not too bad at all!  Sounds idyllic!
<user0> Oh yes.  The first car is amazing
<user1> Yeah its a great feeling having someone thats yours.
<user0> Yes I remember the freedom that comes with the first car.
<user0> I feel exactly the same way.  People should be more considerate and be on time for the sake of others.
<user1> Yes totally agree! Maybe I should just leave and make them wait. Haha
<user0> Yes, that would certainly give them a taste of their own medicine!
<user0> I agree, it's something I struggle with as well. Have you tried an diets you liked?
<user1> I haven't done anything specific with diets, no.  Have you found one that you like?
<user0> I've tried a few, and I would have to say the one that I liked the most was Weight Watchers. It's pretty easy to stay on, and the food is usually good. The only big problem is that it gets expensive.
<user1> I think that that's a common problem with all of them.
<user1> That's so cool! Did they get you anything nice?
<user0> They got me a bunch of gift cards to my favorite stores. They are all so wonderful. I love them so much!
<user1> Time to go shoppin lol!
<user1> Aw Im sorry. Are you doing better now?
<user0> yeah I'm doing much better thanks.  I'll for sure be getting a flu shot next year!
<user1> That's a good idea. I haven't done that in years. I always feel like I barely dodge a bullet by not getting it.
<user0> I have been lucky in the past but I dont remember the last time I have felt that sick. I definitely dont want to go through that again.
<user1> Glad you are doing better!
<user1> I feel you, but at least it should be shorter than driving and the odds of a mishap are much lower than regular transportation.
<user0> i keep telling myself flying is safe but I am petrified of getting on that plane
<user1> I see, I think you may consider a tylenol or some type of sleep pill for the flight, to ensure that you don't feel uncomfortable or paranoid during travel.
<user1> That's awesome. I was always a daddy's boy growing up.
<user0> Awww, yeah Daddy's can be the best! I wish all children could have good daddy's.
<user1> Amen. Mine was a good man. He taught me a lot of good life lessons.
<user1> I am sorry your dog passed away, I totally understand wanting to keep a momento to remind you of him. Was he old when he passed?
<user0> He was about 12.  He was my first dog though! He was a sweetheart.  It is nice keeping something to remind me of him.
<user1> I'm glad you have something that helps keep his memory alive. :)
<user0> I do too! 
<user0> Aw what a sham! Did they give any reason why they hired from the outside?
<user1> My boss said the recruiter is an idiot and just never looked at internal candidates. It was a bummer but I figure I'll look for something else in the company soon
<user0> Well that's a good attitude to have. I don't blame you for being mad. I would be.
<user1> I was a little upset.  My boss and her boss were more angry than me though so I felt good they were at least on my side!
<user1> Oh man, that is exciting! Do you know what kind?
<user0> It's a beautiful 2018 yellow jeep! The car of my dreams! So stoked!
<user1> That's awesome!! I love jeeps!  congratulations, that's great news!
<user1> That's so sweet.  What kind of bird is it?
<user0> I think it is a love bird. She thinks I am the mother and it is so cool when she walks all over me and comes when I call her. I have never had a pet bird before.
<user1> Aww, I'd love to see a video of that.
<user0> Ok, I will make one for you. :)
<user0> You're lucky the cow didnt hurt you.
<user1> Yes I think so. That probably could have killed me. But I guess it was not my time. I angels saved me.
<user0> Good thing you listened to your gut feeling
<user0> Hopefully it will stop soon. That's the worst having to get creative with the little food you have on hand.
<user1> Actually I have no food and I am starving. Maybe I should order a pizza. But then the delivery guy will have the same problem.
<user0> Well that is what they get paid for. Just be sure to tip him well.
<user0> Uh oh. I bet he knew he was in trouble. Did you get him a crate?
<user1> i was on the verge of something more serious and probably would have regret it
<user0> Yeah, I'm glad you didn't do anything you would regret. I hope he is better for you in the future.
<user0> Oh no! I'm so sorry about that. Don't blame yourself, animals like to play with each other!
<user1> Yes but I think I could have avoided it. I am training my dogs now to stay away from the goats. I hope it doesn't happen again.
<user0> That sounds like a good plan. You definitely don't want that to happen again. Sometimes bad things happen in order for us to learn and avoid it again.
<user0> That sounds great, I can remeber going fishing with my dad at that age. Did your 4 year-old have a good time?
<user1> He did!  He caught 4 fish all by himself.
<user0> Wow, that's impressive! I'm glad he had a good time.
<user0> Poor doggy! Did you have to take him to the vet?
<user1> I did end up taking him in. Luckily it wasnt too serious and he was fine a couple days later.  He looked so sad with his big lip!
<user0> I bet he did, I'm glad he's okay though.
<user0> Thats really nice you have a friend like that.That's hard to come by. I hope everything is better for you now.
<user1> thank you, i do not know how i will repay him back, I will always be in his debt
<user0> I'm sure he doesn't expect it but thats a really nice thing he did.
<user0> I hope you arent and I'm not too! It would be rough living on the streets.
<user1> Yeah especially when it is snowing outside. Can you just imagine having to sleep outside like that . Oh! So sad!
<user0> It would be terrible in the winter.  I cant imagine sleeping outside when its freezing
<user0> That sounds fun! Where did you go?
<user1> We went to a greek place.  There were belly dancers and a ton of good meats and appetizers. I think we'll check it out again this weekend since it was so fun!
<user0> Mmmmm, I love greek food! That sounds appetizing! I think I will take my girl there too this week!
<user0> I'm so sorry you feel that way. Maybe you should talk to someone you trust. A family member or a friend.
<user1> that is the problem there is no one I can talk to or share with
<user0> I'm sorry. You could seek out a professional to talk to. Or you could just try meeting some new people.
<user0> What kinds of pets do you have?
<user1> I have chickens, ducks, parrots, cockatiels, budgies, peacocks, guinea pigs, dogs, goats and cows. haha 
<user0> oh wow! you did say a ton! I love animals too. wish I lived somewhere I could have more.
<user1> Yeah, it is so much fun to live with animals. :)
<user1> Did he have superpowers?
<user0> Hah - no.  But he did have the cord wrapped around his neck twice, and he'd tied an overhand knot in it, too.
<user1> That's pretty impressive.
<user1> Oh wow, are you going to be in front of anyone important?
<user0> Not today. I just feel insecure about it, like everyone is looking at me. It is probably just all in my head.
<user1> Usually, you are the one who notices it the most. 
<user1> wow, that must be an interesting thing to be involved with. lots of milk too, i presume.
<user0> Oh, yes! Fresh raw milk is so wonderful and one of the best foods we can eat.
<user1> very cool, wish i could get into something like that. sounds fun
<user1> Awww, I understand. Dogs are sooo great to be around and they are super friendly. 
<user0> i know that what makes it harder not having her around, no companionship
<user1> Maybe also looking into getting a new dog, I know it's hard, but you can get through it! Your friends and family are always there as well.
<user1> That sounds like such an enjoyable life. If only it was so easy!
<user0> Yeah, maybe in my next life I guess, haha.
<user1> Haha, that is true. But we have to make the most of this one. 
<user1> Oh man heart breaker. Thats good yall are friends though. You never know maybe one day yall will be married
<user0> Haha, I hope not...my current girlfriend would probably be a little upset! She's a nice person (the one from high school) but I dont think I could ever marry her
<user1> you dont still have any feelings at all for her?
<user1> Ooh, I've always wanted to learn how to do that. You must be so excited!
<user0> Yes, I have so many ideas! How cool it would be to not have to buy any more expensive clothes and make my own! 
<user1> Omg, that would be awesome. I might just have to learn how to do that myself.
<user1> Ooo! That's exciting! Congrats on your baby! I hope your guests enjoy their time. 
<user0> Thank you! I have so many fun games planned and lots of great food.
<user1> Yay! That sounds like so much fun. Baby showers are a great way to bring everyone together.
<user1> Usually it will let you know if something is wrong. Part of how we are designed! 
<user0> Exactly! The human body is interesting!
<user1> It is, everything has to be balanced just right, or else we feel it.
<user1> Oh no, how did you make things right with the manager. I am sure he is just wanting to get paid. 
<user0> Yes, he did want to get paid but I needed to go home and get my wallet. He got angry with me but what could I do? I had no money with me.
<user1> That is a tough spot to be in, maybe you could of washed dishes for him. Or give him your phone for collateral. 
<user0> I just left but I came straight back and paid. All was fine in the end. But I will never go to that restaurant again.
<user1> That is good, such an embarrassing situation to be in.
<user1> Oh man I want that too! did you get it?
<user0> I did!  It is by far the coolest thing I have ever bought!
<user1> Do you use your computer?
<user0> yeah, I have it plugged into my computer.  I cant tell you, or even begin to explain, how real everything feels when you use it.
<user1> How much do they go for?
<user0> It was $400, having a computer that can run it is the expensive piece
<user1> thats not bad. I have a rx 280 
<user1> Moving, is always such a pain. Did it go smoothly at least?
<user0> Yeah.  He kept up with me pretty well.
<user1> That's good, glad he wasn't having too tough a time.
<user1> Oh man, I can't stand barking dogs. I wish owners would do something to shut them up. 
<user0> i know the worst part is my bedroom is near the fence and the dog barks all night 
<user1> That can make it so hard to sleep at night. 
<user1> Aw man, childhood is full of good memories! I love the smell of strawberries. 
<user0> Yeah, I also remember having my strawberry shortcake themed birthday party. There were strawberries everywhere! I bet you could guess what flavor the cake and ice cream were, lol.
<user1> Haha, clearly strawberry. Sounds like you had an enjoyable childhood! 
<user1> Your neighbor doesn't do anything about his dogs?
<user0> that is the problem, he does nothing, except give me his little mustache smile, one of these days i'll wipe that smile off his face
<user1> If it were me, I'd call the animal shelter and report possible abuse since the dog does nothing but bark all day - poor thing just needs attention and the owner isn't taking care of it.
<user1> Really depends on the person I think. You can't have good people without bad people.
<user0> Yes that is true. The ying and the yang. But I think most people are good though.
<user1> Agreed!
<user1> You are very lucky my friend. There are so many children out there that cannot say the same, sadly. But so happy for you!
<user0> Yeah life ends up pretty dark for tons of people. It's slightly absurd when you think far into it!
<user1> I guess it all comes down to karma, if you believe in that stuff...... I do. :)
<user1> what did you end up doing?
<user0> Luckily, my wife was willing to keep them busy.  Even after she had a crazy day!
<user1> It's good to have a partner. 
<user1> I have a son, it's definitely nice to have some peace and quiet.
<user0> It was for a while, but it was too quiet for me!  I've gotten used to the noise.
<user1> You must have been very happy when they returned home.
<user1> Did you get it?
<user0> No, they ended up giving it to someone with less experience.
<user1> That's disappointing. I feel sorry for you. 
<user1> That sounds like a bummer. Hopefully, you did not lose too much.
<user0> Nope, I'm a little careful when I go out there.  It would have been nice to join in on the winning though!
<user1> Yeah, but it is a good thing to hear you did not lose too much. Some people put all the money on the line.
<user1> Hey, that's awesome! I hope you get it. When do you hear?
<user0> Probably next week sometime. I'm really excited!
<user1> Well I hope you do. What kind of job is it?
<user1> You must have been relieved you were able to help. Did all go as plan?
<user0> yeah! I pretty much knew all the steps that I needed to do before everything started and there werent any surprise issues which was awesome.
<user1> That's awesome! I'm glad it went through without a hitch!
<user1> Oh, that's terrific! What a great feeling that is, to be appreciated and valued!
<user0> i knew she could and would get the promotion, i feel like i am going to burst 
<user1> Oh, I love that you are so happy for her! You sound like such a supportive and loving partner!
<user1> I also have two older puppies, training takes time and care and love.
<user0> It definitely does!  I have one older puppy that I got through potty training.  This one is just taking a little extra time.
<user1> Puppies are smart believe it or not, use treats and don't yell or punish for their mistakes. A change of tone and placing them outside works really well.
<user1> i remember the lite brite toy. it was a nice toy to have.
<user0> It really was! The toys back then seemed to have lasted a lot longer than the toys now too!
<user1> i agree, the toys now days are made cheaply and of poor quality. everything is about video games. 
<user1> Moving can be stressful for sure, hopefully you had some help?
<user0> yeah, the help was great and we did end up getting everything over.  Now the fun part is unpacking the boxes!
<user1> It's like christmas! only you already know whats in the boxes. the best part about moving is you can have a fresh start on organization. 
<user1> That's not good!  What did you do to try to get him to listen again?
<user0> I made a deal that if he went to bed he would get tablet time the next day and if he didnt then he wouldnt get any time
<user1> I bet that worked!
<user1> Oh man, i'm about to eat dinner over here! lol that's pretty gross. My cat pukes up stuff all the time so i can kind of relate.
<user0> Sorry about that! Yeah, it was a terrible thing to wake up to!
<user1> I bet, hope the dog is feeling better though.
<user1> interesting, what was the issue?
<user0> Well when he was during the potty training stage he would often poop on the floor.   HOwever he would then eat it!!!!!   I could smell it but not find it anywhere.   He would come running into the living room wanting to lick you on the face with poop breath!
<user1> oh man, that is an issue, i hope he grows out of it
<user1> I bet you cant wait.  WHere are going for your vacation?
<user0> i always wanted to visit Miami, i can't wait to visit the beach and take in all  the fun
<user1> Miami sounds like a great place to go for a vacation.   I wish I was going with you!
<user1> That sucks! What were they upset about?
<user0> I don't even know!  She does that sometimes, and just badgers you.  I can't figure out what fires her up.
<user1> It sounds like a very challenging environment to work in.
<user1> That's exciting! When will she be moving in?
<user0> In 2 weeks.  It'll come up fast, I think thats why I'm starting to get a little more nervous.  Its not even her, its just the move that will not be fun
<user1> Does she live far away?
<user1> That sounds very frustrating.
<user0> It is!  The guy at the city could care less if he helps us out.
<user1> Hopefully you'll able to get it all sorted out soon.  I'm sure when it's done it'll be a beautiful house.
<user1> What happened?
<user0> It was a duck hunting game and all of a sudden the dog from the game killed my mom and started coming after me.  I dont know if you've ever tried VR but everything feels SO real.  It was pretty scary
<user1> I've never tried VR, but just imagining that is scaring me away from it.
<user1> Congrats!  How exciting for you.
<user0> thank you, when they called, I did not know who it was at first, then it was, wow I got the job
<user1> That's a long time to hold out hope.  I bet you were shocked.
<user1> It always takes time. Hang in there It will all work out.
<user0> Well, he's got another interview on Thursday. I just know he will get that one!
<user1> I bet so too!  Good luck to you both.
<user1> What subject did you choose?
<user0> I chose finance and economics
<user1> Nice choice. I guess you have good relationship with your brother.
<user1> why was the officer yelling at her?
<user0> She was trying to cross the road and accidentally had her phone fall, the officer thought she was insane
<user1> wow, that's unfortunate. i would feel embarrassed for the lady
<user1> That's so wonderful. I love being cared for when I am ill.
<user0> Yah, i feel loved so much
<user1> It is an amazing thing to have a loving mother. Everyone should show more appreciation to their moms.
<user1> Sorry about that, you could have taken a taxi
<user0> It was a short enough walk, I just stayed aware of my surroundings and got home safe.
<user1> good enough you got home safe
<user1> Did you have a good childhood? You must miss a lot of things.
<user0> I think I had a good childhood. I love that I have many photos that I ca look back on.
<user1> Yes. Nostalgia is unavoidable when we look back on our youth.
<user1> That's unfortunate. But at least you learned from the experience, right?
<user0> I sure did. I am just embarrassed that I did that, I am not usually that way. It was out of character for me.
<user1> No need to feel ashamed. We all make mistakes and at least you learned your lesson.
<user1> That's nice that you helped him. I'm sure he appreciated it!
<user0> He did, he is nice and well now. I just know how horrible it is to be sick, it helps to have someone to care for you.
<user1> Yes, it really does. I am sure if you get sick, he will remember and do the same for you!
<user1> Wow! Were you hurt? Was anyone else hurt?
<user0> luckily the only problem I had was my neck was sore for a few weeks but nobody else was hurt
<user1> That's good news at least. I hope you are feeling better now. And don't be hard on yourself, accidents happen.
<user1> Oh that's great, its awesome when the kids go off to school each year.
<user0> Yes - this is m child's first year and it was pretty difficult for me to let someone take care of him instead of me. You know how it is! Parent life.
<user1> You'll get used to it and begin to appreciate your quiet time, haha.
<user0> Yes!  I'm already enjoying it!  How are you doing?
<user0> Wal-Mart is a place where weirdness always happens. Can you tell me what happened, I'm dying to know!
<user1> Well, I was parked pretty close and a guy came up to ask me for gas money!  There was a gas station a small walk away though!
<user0> Do you think he was panhandling you for money or a person who really needed it? Did you give him money?
<user1> I didn't have any cash on me.  He got out of a vehicle that had two other guys in it...staring at me!
<user1> That must have been a very windy day!
<user0> I wanted to run and hide.  I haven't' worn a dress since.  
<user1> I bet It will teach you.
<user0> Oh it did.  I learned my lesson.
<user0> I go to church every Sunday I love it.
<user1> yeah its a great feeling getting back into church !
<user0> The people you can meet are super.
<user0> That
<user1> Yeah its nice when people do kind things like this it doesn't happen very often now day
<user0> That is really not thing. I wish more people would do such nice thing. I know that made your day.
<user0> So you don't like to be alone. I am so sorry that affects you. So what would you do? 
<user1> I was used to having family or friends around most of the time in my old place, but then I moved away. I had to make new friends which I found very difficult
<user0> Yes, usually when one relocates it's hard to make new friends, but eventually it will happen.
<user1> I eventually made friends through work, and it is really nice when my old friends come to visit too 
<user0> That was really nice of your old friends.
<user0> Happy birthday. What was your favorite gift?
<user1> A pair of shoe
<user0> Nice. What brand of shoes were they?
<user0> That's terrible. Were you able to identify the kid?
<user1> Yeah eventually the kid was caught i told the man and he caught him shortly after
<user0> I'm glad he was able to catch him.
<user0> Wow, how was it? I have never seen that trailer. 
<user1> It was just sad. I love Paul Walker and his movies. I still remember hearing about him passing away in the same way he became famous. In a fast car.
<user0> Aww, that is so sad to hear. He must have made some great movies! 
<user1> Oh he did!  I think the one about candy cane and the truck driver was my favorite. I can't remember the name.
<user1> Are they twins?!
<user0> Yes!  They are so sweet. I don't even like kids and I really felt my heart warm up to them.
<user1> Awww! Twins seem like a handful but also very exciting at the same time!
<user1> Oh, I'm sorry. What happened?
<user0> It didn't happen to me directly, but my husband passed GAS while we were shopping. Everyone was staring.
<user1> I can imagine that you did want to run and hide. Sometimes husbands get us into all kinds of situations.
<user1> I've been in that situation before. Did she find out about it? 
<user0> She didnt say anything but I think she knew.  I mean, I still watched the episodes that she missed with her!
<user1> Well that's all that matters. If she was okay with it. I'm sure she was happy watching the episodes with you, even if you had already watched them. 
<user1> That sounds like a bit of work. Are you adjusting to your place now?
<user0> Yeah, unpacking and all that fun stuff now.  I really like the new place though.
<user1> That's what's most important. I'm glad everything has gone well.
<user1> Oh, I'm sorry. Why didn't you get to go with him?
<user0> I have to stay home with our son.  It is hard for us to find a baby sitter for him.
<user1> Oh, that's too bad. I know exactly how you feel. Hopefully your husband will watch your son another night so you can go have some fun. 
<user1> Was it a lot of fun?
<user0> Oh gosh yes. I wore a beautiful dress. I felt so pretty!
<user1> That's great, but you don't have to wear a fancy dress to be beautiful. I'm sure you're gorgeous no matter what you wear!
<user0> Thank you! I feel like a slob lately.
<user1> It's ok, just try your best to remind yourself how beautiful you are and practice self-care as a habit.
<user1> What a great feeling! You must love your dog.
<user0> i really do, no matter what happens, she will always be by my side
<user1> She sounds like a great companion.
<user1> Are you looking forward to it?
<user0> Yes. I have all my binders ready with paper and a calendar to keep track of stuff.  I'm nervous but ready!
<user1> Exciting! I'm sure you'll do fine.
<user0> I hope so!  It's very different from undergraduate
<user0> Why is that?
<user1> He keeps screwing up my prescription!  I've needed it for a week now but they keep sending it to the wrong place or use the wrong name
<user0> Wow, that's no good. I hope they get it worked out soon.
<user1> Me too.  
<user1> I can't play those kinds of games. Too spooky for me.
<user0> It didnt start off scary but out of nowhere everyone around me was dying and I was home alone with a killer outside the house.  It all just feels so real in VR too.
<user1> That would keep me up at night.
<user1> Oh my gosh that's insane. Well, I'm sure you'll be able to control your impulses in the future. 
<user0> i hope so, i was doing so well on my diet but I feel like I failed
<user1> I've been there before too. The important thing to remember is that there is always another chance to make it right tomorrow. 
<user1> Aww, sounds like he is teaching the puppy. That's so sweet.
<user0> It is pretty awesome!  I'm impressed that he knows he doesnt need to be first and the puppy should have priority.
<user1> Yeah, sounds like a pretty smart pup.
<user1> I do understand, I have a son myself. You just need to be patient and continue trying.
<user0> Thanks, we are.  He did finally go #2 in the toilet by himself last night, though!
<user1> That is awesome. I am proud of him 
<user1> gotta risk it for the biscuit
<user0> Haha, I dont think I could do that to my girlfriend.  I like her too much for a random chick.
<user1>  i feel ya but sometimes temptation is good gets the heart pumping
<user1> It can be nerve wrecking. I'm sure you will do fine, though! Have confidence!
<user0> i feel like i know the material but i am not sure if i can pull it off in front of others
<user1> You know they say, imagine them in their underwear...I wonder that really works. I'm not fond of public speaking either.
<user1> Did you spend a lot of the time on the project?
<user0> Yes, I feel like I worked really hard and I put in so many hours. I guess it was not good enough. :(
<user1> I wouldnt get discouraged.  Maybe talk to your boss and see what you can improve on next time.  I'm sure, at least if you have a good boss, they will want you to succeed and guide you in how to do better.
<user0> Thank you for your great advice my friend!
<user0> Nice! Enjoy it! I like living alone. It is so peaceful! I get lonely somtimes but for the most part it is great!
<user1> It does feel a little lonely.  It's weird coming home and not really having someone to talk to in person.
<user0> Yeah, but they are all just a phone call away. Keep your head up, your girlfriend will be there soon!
<user0> Oh I know, mine too! I love how all the colors change with the setting sun.
<user1> Yeah, it is such a good time to reflect and meditate on life and stop to enjoy the beauty of this world.
<user0> It reminds you of how beautiful life is.
<user0> Wow, that's rude! He won't last long...
<user1> I know right?  I made sure to keep my mouth shut and not add on to what they were saying or doing.
<user0> Yeah, some nerve on that guy. He should be grateful to have a job!
<user0> Oh wow! Congrats!! How exciting!! How far along is she?
<user1> Only one more month to go. She is about the explode though! Glad it is her and not me, lol.
<user0> LOL Right!!! It's way too hot to be pregnant right now!
<user1> Totally agree! But I will be there to fan my sister for her at least. Haha
<user0> You are so awesome!!! I wish I had  sister like you when I was pregnant.
<user0> I've been in that situation before!  It can be scary
<user1> It was!  I didn't want to chase him off either.  Thankfully he just kind of wandered away.
<user0> I'm glad it worked out in the end!  I wish people would be more careful with their dogs.
<user0> Oh, no. Did you take it back or keep it
<user1> I have not had time to go back yet but I will for sure. I feel bad like as if I did something wrong. I better check my change from now on.
<user0> The store might not take it back at this point if it has been to long. 
<user0> That sounds beautiful! What emotions did they bring out of you?
<user1> My grandmother kept those trees at our old house.  They super made me miss her and when we used to sit outside on her porch.
<user0> I'm sorry! What a lovely memory to have of her though. It's good to still have things in your life that remind you of her.
<user0> Oh no! That's so sad. I'm so sorry, I know you must feel like crap.
<user1> It's strange sometimes how we get so attached to material things like this.  I know I really shouldn't but it feels like a piece of me is gone.
<user0> I understand completely. I have things of my grandfather's that I can never replace.
<user0> Sweet! Where did you go?
<user1> We went to a lake not far from here.  We had a ton of fun on the boat . . . nobody else was on the water one of the days!
<user0> That would be awesome to have the whole lake to yourself! My guess is the weather was nice too if you guys got to use the boat most days!
<user0> I've had similar experiences.  What do you end up doing?
<user1> I write up feedback for development. It just gets frustrating when they start to demand that I fix it.  I might be good at my job but not good enough to do a code change on the fly.
<user0> Have you ever had a positive experience from that cycle?
<user0> oh no! hope all is well with your dog.
<user1> Thank you. Other than an allergic reaction and a subsequent skin infection all is well. Just a couple weeks of meds and a change in diet needed.
<user0> Good to read. Always great to find a vet you can trust. Looks like you did. 
<user0> BBQ sounds so good right now! How was it?
<user1> It wasn't bad.  It wasn't earth shattering good either.  Everything just weirdly seemed okay.  It was a bit strange. 
<user0> Well that's kind of disappointing. It's always a let down when you go out and it isn't is good as you were hoping.
<user0> i completely agree. though, i'm remote so i am never sitting in the same room as others so i can distract myself ;)
<user1> That must be nice . . . I'm in person.  However, I actually had a productive meeting this morning.  How novel that was!
<user0> lol. it kinda is. i moved about 3 hours south of my office a few years ago and since even at the office my work involves connecting to remote data centers it hasn't changed my job any. 
<user0> That's terrible! What did you do?
<user1> I had to bolt out of the store!  I have never been so embarrassed.  Lucky for me I had a napkin in my purse so I didn't get it everywhere.
<user0> That's good. I'm glad your alright.
<user0> Oh no! That's so sad. You must've been so upset. 
<user1> I was! I thought I was going to get in trouble
<user0> Hopefully you didn't and hopefully the other kids didn't make fun of you
<user0> What kind of car was it?
<user1> i was an old Cadillac, reason I miss it, lot of memories of family and friends riding in it
<user0> Oh I bet! My husband wants an older car when we can afford it
<user0> OH NO! I would be devastated. Did he pass, or missing?
<user1> i cannot find her anywhere, she is missing, it feels like I have a part of me missing 
<user0> I am so sorry. I am sure you are. I would be devastated if I was in your shoes. Does she have a chip? Maybe someone will get her to a vet office.
<user0> Good job! How do you think you did on it?
<user1> I know I did well! I studied and felt very prepared when I took it.
<user0> That is a good feeling. Time to celebrate before the grind starts all over!
<user0> Yeah I like going straight to the point too
<user1> Definitely. Nothing worse than dragging out a drive because you didn't pack enough food and didn't plan bathroom breaks.
<user0> I like when I get places earlier than expected
<user0> I understand that completely! Did you have to get any work done?
<user1> Yes I had to get a filling in my very back tooth.  THe dentist said I had a very deep cavity and to raise my hand if I started to feel anything because it was very close to my nerve.   I was scared the whole time.
<user0> That sounds scary! I always avoid going to the dentist until I absolutely have to. I know that's pretty bad!
<user0> Oh no! I hate when that happens. Was he afraid or just didn't want to sleep?
<user1> He just didnt want to sleep. I think he was overtired and trying to fight it at that point.
<user0> Ugh, that's the worst. That happens a lot with my son as well. Hopefully he wasn't too cranky today!
<user0> That is wonderful! You must be happy, shows that he is getting bigger, soon it will be college 
<user1> Haha, I hope not too soon!  I was really happy, he is growing pretty fast!
<user0> College is when the tear will start to flow. I love children.
<user0> That will be fun. What a great way to relax and unwind
<user1> I think so.  I'm hoping the weather will be nice and we can all have a great time!
<user0> I saw the weather forecast. We only have a 20% chance of rain so you know how it is here. We'll be good.
<user0> That must be hard to do, he wants to be beside you. He is going to miss you.
<user1> I know.  It's tough to hear but he needs to be a little more independent and sleep in his own bed too!
<user0> Yes he needs to so you would have to ignore him at nights.
<user0> That is so sweet. What is her name?
<user1> Angie, i like to give her a warm bath, dress her in her doggy clothes and give her a doggy treat
<user0> I can just imagine she sleeps in your bed sometimes. I love dogs, I would like to have a dog someday.
<user0> That is very cute, the little one probably couldn't hold its bladder as long. 
<user1> Definitely not.  I was surprised that he knew to let the little one go first!
<user0> That was very smart of him, maybe he remembers back to his puppy days.
<user0> That's good. How is it going?
<user1> It's going well!  So far no accidents and he doesnt appear to have ruined anything.
<user0> That's great news! It sounds like he is enjoying his new freedom, and was ready for it. 
<user0> I'm glad you didn't hit the dog!  Did he jump out at you suddenly?
<user1> Yes, he came out of nowhere and I slammed on my brakes. My tires skid across the road.
<user0> I live out in a rural area where people don't always have control of their dogs.  Sometimes those little ankle-biting dogs will start chasing the car and they make a break for the car and it makes one really fearful that you'll hit them.
<user0> lol, guess you were pretty hungry
<user1> Yeah, now I am scared somebody will find out. I better go buy some more before anyone gets home. Haha
<user0> yeah, might wanna go replace it
<user0> That sounds amazing. What's your favorite beach to go to?
<user1> I don't really have a favorite. They are all my favorite! But I prefer the beaches that have perfect soft sand with no rocks or anything. Like a huge swimming pool! 
<user0> Those are the best. Especially the white sand crystal clear water beaches.
<user0> i sure it was beautiful
<user1> It looked like another planet or something. Very sci-fi. Almost scary actually.
<user0> really, i wouldve never thought that. i have a friend who is in Dubai on a teaching assignment
<user0> yuck, how gross!!
<user1> Yeah, who does that? I have three pet turtles so I better keep a good watch on them. lol
<user0> lol right, they could easily be your neighbors dinner
<user0> Oh my gosh, I am so sorry for your family.
<user1> Thank you .  Shes a fighter i hope she can push through 
<user0> I'm sure she can with all the technology and modern medicine now. She's got this!!
<user0> why do you live so far from family
<user1> It is just where I ended up in life. You know one thing leads to another and your living a whole knew life.
<user0> i would like a new life. i totally understand
<user0> what? that scary
<user1> Someone was grabbed from their home and brought out to the street and was shot in the foot. Guess they wanted to teach him a lesson.
<user0> wow, a hard lesson
<user0> I understand!  I live in the country and have the same problem.
<user1> It always happens when there are electrical storms. It seems to be storm season around here.
<user0> Yes.  The only company available out here is Century Link and they just crash randomly all the time.
<user0> That is very cool. What took you all around the world? What was your favourite place?
<user1> My father was in the military so I lived all over the world my first 20 years of life. My favorite place is Spain.
<user0> What interesting stories you must have! I think that would be really neat, but settling down is probably good too. 
<user0> That is so sad.  I hate it when pets die.
<user1> Yeah, it is terrible. I just wish I knew why but oh well. She will have more babies in a couple months. 
<user0> yes.  they do like to have lots of  babies
<user0> I am going on a trip to Peru to visit Machu Picchu! I can't sleep because of the anticipation!
<user1> WOW im so jealous! You lucky dog.
<user0> I hear it is a very spiritual place to be and full of beauty and history.
<user1> I have heard the same. Are you going with anyone else?
<user0> Yes, my friends are coming with me. :)
<user1> I want to be your friend!
<user1> Congrats! Did you do it because of football season?
<user0> I honestly do not really watch football but I most excited to catch up on some of my favorite TV shows.
<user1> Cool! Whats your favoirite? I like the office.
<user0> Right now I am really enjoying Mr. Robot. I've never seen The Office but I always hear wonderful things about it.
<user1> I have never heard of Mr. Robot actually.
<user1> Same here! I am glad you are doing well! :)
<user0> i am glad you are doing well also. I like my job and i have a loving family, no complaints here.
<user1> I hope these feelings last for you!
<user1> A puppy!  That's so exciting!  Are you going to keep it?
<user0> I am not sure yet. I already have 4 dogs. I want to because he is so cute!
<user1> I don't know that I would be able to give it up.  4 is a lot, but what's one more?
<user0> Yeah, lol true!
<user0> Well I'm sure he will be, most guys are. I'd never get to  do anything if my girlfriend didn't trust me.
<user1> Yeah. I was in a bad relationship before with a man that was extremely untrustworthy so sometimes I get a bit crazy sometimes. 
<user0> Everyone gets jealous, It when you act on unfounded stuff that is the issue.
<user0> Yes sometimes people do stick their noses in where they do not belong
<user1> Yes, it is like they don't have a life of their own and want to control others lives. 
<user0> Yes.  Especially men who want to mansplain things to you.
<user0> Wow!  How much did he win?
<user1> He won like $40,000. He is a good man to give it all away to a good cause.
<user0> That is awesome that he gave it away!  Maybe good karma will let him win again.
<user0> Good choice. You could have broken down and never made it to school.
<user1> Yeah so true. The funny thing is as I was driving into the gas station my car started to stall because of having zero gas. lol
<user0> HAHA! You are super lucky you are smart. Lol
<user0> Everyone handles stress differently. My anxiety gets so High I sometimes cancel my plans.
<user1> I know it is not healthy for the body to get so stressed out but I just can't help it. Maybe I need a therapist.
<user0> I go to a psychiatrist and take meds, It just fixes what your body doesn't make, or do properly. It helps so much. 
<user0> Oh no! It will be ok. It seems everyone in life has to go through that at least once. Everyone gets through it!
<user1> Yeah, I feel really bad though. It is such a terrible feeling to be rejected like that.
<user0> Sometimes you need those times to make your realize how special having a job is. Gives you perspective.
<user0> I hope everything is fine, How did it turn out?
<user1> It turned out fine in the end. I knew the doctor would do what he thought was best - and my son did get better!
<user0> Im happy to hear that, a sick child is always a scary thing.
<user0> Neat. Where are you going?
<user1> We are driving to Florida to visit family. It will be a long drive but that's a part of the fun.
<user0> Sounds exciting. Have fun.
<user0> Oh wow, are you feeling super envious?
<user1> You bet I am! I told him I was driving my car whenever we go out because I don't want to see it,lol.
<user0> Ha ha, I don't blame you! Hopefully you can get the car you want soon though.
<user0> I 'm glad to here it will be fine , but what was wrong with it?
<user1> He want really weak and had a fever. It was because of an allergy that gave him a severe skin infection.
<user0> I 'm glad you was able to pin point the problem and I hope he stays in good health.
<user0> Wow, that's so mean of them to laugh at you! At least someone pointed it out eventually, right? 
<user1> yeah, but i think my boss even seen it too, i wanted to hide under my desk
<user0> That's embarrasing. But hey, I think the best way to get over moments like those is to just laugh at yourself! Don't beat yourself up for it. 
<user0> Wonderful I bet she is really content if everything is perfect. Love to hear that someone is doing well.
<user1> I do too, I just wish I had her life at times.
<user0> I understand but try not to be jealous. Good things will come to you to in its own time
<user0> The waiting must be very difficult and nerve wracking.
<user1> i know, im having trouble concentrating at work, I just want to know right now
<user0> Things like that make me antsy.
<user0> A new haircut can do wonders! I always feel like a million bucks after.
<user1> I wasn't too sure about it but all the lovely compliments really made me feel good! 
<user0> I bet you looked great! Those compliments would've made me feel good too!
<user0> Oh? What specifically were you talking to her about?
<user1> My aspirations when I was younger. We had a good laugh when I read in one of my old journals that I wanted to be a teacher when earlier that day I had stated that I couldn't imagine being a teacher now.
<user0> Haha! Well, as we mature, we learn so much more about ourselves.
<user0> Haha you are a good father. I hope you can make it through it!
<user1> I am a mother not a father silly.  Yes I made it through all right, but thought I was going to die!!   THey had me ride the ferris wheel and I was crying as they were laughing at me.
<user0> Oh my gosh! I'm sorry! haha Thats funny. Atleast you have them a story to always remember.;)
<user0> Oh no! So what did you do?!
<user1> I was so angry, I had to leave for work very soon. I ended up just asking a neighbor to borrow some. I didn't have anytime to buy any before work. I couldn't afford to be late.
<user0> That's nice of your neighbor! Your boyfriend should've told you that there was no toothpaste earlier. Maybe there would've been time to get some. But at least you didn't go to work with stinky breath, right?
<user0> Haha everyone has to do that once. Can you tell me a great story about the party?
<user1> Sure can!   Of course you cant have a party as a teen without alcohol, so needless to say we were all drunk.   We attempted to play darts.   Since we were all drunk we missed the board leaving wholes all over the wall.  THe house was trashed when my parents returned.  Years later I feel bad about it still.
<user0> Hahaha thats funny. I hope you guys are still on good terms. To be honest little holes sounds like an easy fix.
<user0> Wow, cool. Maybe you can ask to tag along?
<user1> I will be at work, maybe next time
<user0> That's too bad. Well, at least you have something to work towards and plan as a goal for yourself.
<user0> That's amazing! How old is she?
<user1> she is 9
<user0> Wow, that must've been a big thing for both of you.
<user0> I am sorry I do not know what nclex is but I wish you good luck
<user1> Its a nursing exam, thank you
<user0> O ok I hope that everything works out for you 
<user0> Wow! Did you try to get it out?
<user1> Yup, I adopted it and he's my pet now!
<user0> That's amazing! He probably loves you so much
<user0> Do you feel nice and refreshed though?
<user1> yes definitely!
<user0> I did the same thing today, so you are not alone in your behavior friend!
<user0> Oh no! Did it break?
<user1> Unfortunately yes. The screen shattered and I went for over a month without music.
<user0> Oh, that really stinks. I hope you were able to get another one.
<user0> Did you do some neat doctor stuff on it?
<user1> No, I hate giving chemical medicine to my animals. I just kept her on a heating blanket and gave her lots of fresh veggies. She is alright now!
<user0> Oh yea that sounds like you did a good job!
<user0> That is good, how long did it take before you go him to this point?
<user1> It took about a month. I think it was quicker but I was just too nervous to bring him around others dogs to find out.
<user0> Yeah i understand, it is good that you took him there though
<user0> Wow they must be doing well. Why dont you try to get one?
<user1> really cannot afford one, but the neighbor can, he is always buying expensive stuff, last month he bought a speed boat.
<user0> sounds wasteful to me. life isnt about material things anyway. 
<user0> Yeah sometimes kids say things that they really dont mean in the heat of the momment
<user1> It really hurt my feelings. I wish he would've handled it better. I'm more disappointed in him lashing out rather than what he said.
<user0> well maybe you guys should talk
<user1> I told him I was disappointed in his actions, but I still love him. We all make mistakes.
<user1> Ugh my neighbors do that sometimes. It's the worst! I think some things should not be allowed to be cooked unless you live alone.
<user0> Exactly! I had to air out the place for a couple hours after.
<user1> Ick. Hopefully the smell is fully gone now
<user1> Oh that is the worst feeling! I hate using the restroom in public as is. 
<user0> Yeah, I wish someone told me at least. They all probably just laughed. Haha
<user1> Maybe.  For me I just don't want to cause a stranger to be embarassed lol
<user1> I am with you, i like it a lot more than summer personally
<user0> I can get so much work done indoor and the beauty outside is wonderful. I love winter clothes and all the winter holidays.
<user1> I feel that, I hate being hot. In the winter I can be comfy and I can always just put on a jacket if I get too cold, but in the summer it is not that easy.
<user1> I was very nervous. I did not know if I would pass or not.
<user0> I took mine last summer I was nervous also. My heat was racing the whole time. I was so anxious!
<user1> Did you pass the test?
<user1> I am the same way, I barely make anything compared to a lot of people I know
<user0> Yeah, and it seems so hard to make money these days, at least for me. Maybe I should move to the city where there are more opportunities.
<user1> I think cities are more expensive, like living costs, so I do not want to live there ether personally
<user0> Yeah, you are right my friend. :)
<user0> I'm assuming that he/she didn't return it in time. I'm sorry.
<user1> i accidentally left it at his house and had to message him on facebook and ask him if he could drive it over
<user0> Oh, I understand. Did it bring it to you at all?
<user0> That is amazing!  I'm really happy for you!
<user1> Thank you! I have worked so hard for so many years and finally it shows that someone paid attention. :)
<user0> It sounds like you really deserve it!
<user0> that does sound terrifying , are you feeling better ?
<user1> I am but I still think about how things could've been so much different right now if I hadn't swerved just at the right moment.
<user0> at least your ok, thank god for that
<user0> Nice, for what position
<user1> as a supervisor. I feel that all of my hard work and skill has given me the inside track for this position
<user0> That's pretty great, you must really take the initiative.  Good job
<user0> You're much braver than me. I would never host a dinner party.. don't feel like I'm good at planning, and don't feel like I'm interesting enough to talk to a bunch of different people.
<user1> Yeah, we all have different personalities. But you would come to a dinner party if invited, right?
<user0> I think, maybe, yeah! It depends on who's there, and if I felt comfortable with the host. If I felt like I had enough people to kind of "rescue me" and who I could talk to at the party if I got anxious and couldn't talk to strangers, then that'd be alright. Other than that, I just kind of do like maybe a group of 4, max
<user0> Aw, that's too bad. You did the right thing by telling her though.
<user1> Yes, she didn't even get mad. I still felt so guilty about it though. 
<user0> Maybe you could save up and purchase her a new one.
<user1> Honestly that is such a wonderful idea!
<user1> I am right there with you!  God is good and wow, He's been with me through so much hardship.  I'm so happy you feel the same way.
<user0> Oh yes. He is there within all of us and he is the greatest friend we will ever have! He will never let us down. Even when we think He has we should only think it is something that I need to learn and He is so caring that He wants to teach me.
<user1> Yes, we can always count on Him to know the bigger picture and have faith that He's working for our good.  Hope you have a blessed day!
<user1> They really have changed. I know exactly how you feel and love thinking back to the time.
<user0> Yeah, so you remember all those wonderful old Christmas movies and all those commercials they played in between. I still have some videos of recordings from the 80's. 
<user1> Those were awesome! My favorite was the coke commercial at Christmas time. So many memories!
<user1> Oh fun!  How big was it about?  Did it have neat markings on it?
<user0> It was as big as a small bird, I was super surprised. It was furry and white all over. I caught it with a cup and let it outside so it can live on!
<user1> I think I saw someone post a picture of those online. Maybe it was a lunar moth! What a fun experience!
<user1> What is your nieces name?
<user0> Amelia, she makes my heart so happy!
<user1> That's amazing, was it your sisters first baby?
<user1> It will be amazing!  I should do that too!
<user0> Yes! I just went to the local nursery and they had so many plants to choose from. I made sure to only choose the ones that had some kind of fragrant smell. I am dreaming of all the flower arrangements I will make next year.
<user1> That sounds so great!   I hope your plants grow beautifully!
<user0> Thanks!! :)
<user0> That sounds like the perfect remedy for feeling down. Getting out in the sun and outside the house/bed is so good.  I'm sorry you're struggling with depression.  I understand.
<user1> Thank you for your kind words, it means a lot really. And yeah the cool breeze felt so comforting, it completely changed my mood!
<user0> I am so glad!  You know what to do to help your body and mind and that is good self-care.  I try to do that as well as meditate and pray in the morning.  Really refocuses me.  I'm glad you're feeling better!
<user0> I imagine, are you prepared for it?
<user1> Not yet, but I will start preparing. I am worried we may lose power or our house may flood.
<user0> Oh yes, last year with huracan Irma we went without power for 5 days.
<user0> Aw, did it bring back a lot of good memories for you?
<user1> yes definitely, it was great
<user0> That's awesome. Sometimes I wish I could be back in my childhood. Maybe if only for a day. ha ha.
<user0> I am sure it'll be ok. Usually if you stay in contact with them and don't blow them off for a long time it will be OK.
<user1> Yeah but i am usually so meticulous about those things.  I hope they don't charge an overdraft fee.
<user0> I would call them. They usually give you some credit for that.
<user0> That's good. I assume you have studied hard and are prepared?
<user1> for the past two weeks I have bee working on it and this week I have been practicing it 
<user0> Good luck! You will do great!
<user0> Haha, I'm sorry but I had a little laugh at that. It reminded me of the time I did that to my teacher in school. I was embarrassed, but it made me feel better to find out that it seems like it's a common thing that happens, since they're female authority figures that you can easily mix up.
<user1> Exactly, especially since we were only dating for a few months! I felt so awkward but she just laughed it off.
<user0> Yeah, she knew what you meant. She probably forgot in two minutes, while you've thought about it for much longer. The best thing to do there is to just show off your sense of humor and ability to make fun of yourself and not take yourself too seriously, which it sounds like maybe you did.
<user0> That's gross, why are they coming in?
<user1> Well they are actually my pet pigeons. They are the beautiful white ones with a fan tail. But they sometimes like to come inside to see if they can munch on anything.
<user0> You should probably avoid feeding them if you want a clean house.
<user1> No better I just put some screen on my windows, lol.
<user1> I sure wish it wasn't. I live far from my family and they can't even make time for me to go to them. So I feel for you, it is very sad.
<user0> Family should come first, right? The people of today are just becoming more isolated and lonely. I wish everyone would wake up!
<user1> Absolutely first. Especially when you don't live close.
<user1> I bet it wasn't Comcast! They wouldn't even give you a cup of water for free.
<user0> That's so funny! I was so surprised too but really happy. I might even pay for the services when my free year is up.
<user1> I am glad you had a nice experience! Its difficult to find such a company that cares about its customers!
<user1> Oh, wow! That is crazy, have you talked to the vet?
<user0> The vet says that this can be normal but to make sure that I give them their worm pills regularly. 
<user1> I thought it would be normal. Good thing to be cautious. 
<user1> Well it is a good thing you unplugged everything!
<user0> Yeah! I learned my lesson from experience. We get pretty crazy storms out here. 
<user1> That is a good lesson to learn early, I am glad everything turned out okay for you!
<user1> That sounds amazing!  But terrifying too lol
<user0> I am not nervous yet but I for sure will be when it's time to jump out of that plane! Oh, what am I getting myself into, lol.
<user1> I admire you!  I don't think you'll regret getting this experience
<user1> Hahah that is funny. Were your parents angry?
<user0> Yes, they demanded to know where we got the money to buy all that candy. We lied and said it was from a birthday party at school. Haha
<user1> Haha did they believe it?
<user0> Yes, heehee......
<user0> nice, what system do you play on?
<user1> Xbox primarily, I'm hoping he'll get everything back in one piece
<user0> i really enjoy video games as well
<user0> That's the worst! Have you tried talking to your neighbor?
<user1> i have, that what makes me so mad, he just smiles at me while I tell him and he does not do anything about it
<user0> You might try contacting the authorities, though I don't know if it would help. 
<user0> thats awesome! its really cool to be able to keep things in the family
<user1> It really was! It brought back so many wonderful and touching memories.
<user0> did he enjoy the toys>
<user1> He really did. It made me happy.
<user1> Yeah that can be nerve racking! How did it go?
<user0> He mostly speaks French, and although I understand it perfectly I have trouble speaking. In the end it went well, and he was super easy-going and made me feel like family.
<user1> That is good! Are you guys close now>
<user0> We are! Every time I come over, we drink a lot of different beers together. It's how we bond!
<user0> Good job! Do you feel pretty prepared?
<user1> I felt super prepared and I ended up getting the job just last Thursday!
<user0> WOWZA! Congrats! Is it a job you can build a career out of.
<user1> In a way yes and no. I'm teaching online, and my major in University is Education at the moment. So it helps me in school, and looks good on a CV for a full-time teacher position in an actual school someday in the future.
<user0> Oh thats good! Thanks for teaching. :)
<user1> Thank you for appreciating teachers!
<user0> My mom is one so i know how important you guys are.
<user0> Man.. i need some of that luck!
<user1> Same here. Just last week, he won over $400 playing slot machines, and I really wish that could've been me.
<user0> Wow thats awesome! i never win anything like that
<user0> I agree! I wish I was able to make things
<user1> It is really fun to create things, anyone can do it! But talent I think is a gift from God.
<user0> For sure you are born with those types of talents!
<user0> That is cool! I love flash backs from the past especially when it comes to television. I sometimes watch old shows on youtube that I used to watch as a kid. Love it!
<user1> same here, I loved watching Batman as a kid and could not wait to get home from school to watch it.
<user0> I used to watch the Wonder Years after school. I love watching it until this very day. 
<user0> that must have been embarrassing, I hope you weren't to traumatized
<user1> I think it is a good trauma cause to this day it keeps me working hard for my dreams so that I will never have to be in that place again.
<user0> that is good to hear, it was a motivation to succeed, a great character building 
<user0> Aw man that sucks. It must have been a crazy storm.
<user1> it was pretty bad but i think the tree was already dying
<user0> How big was it?
<user0> You shouldn't think about death whilst you're alive! Just live each day to the fullest. 
<user1> Yes you are right but it is hard to not think about it when there is so much death going on around the world and we have to hear about it through the media.
<user0> Yes but death comes to all of us someday. So I think its best we enjoy our life whilst we are blessed with it. 
<user1> You are right my friend! Thanks!
<user1> That is a good test of friendship.  Did he keep his word?
<user0> Yes in the end, he showed up and help me fix my car. I am really glad that he did.
<user1> It is such a blessing to have good friends on whom you can depend.  
<user1> Nice! I hope you get it, I'll cross my fingers for you also! Do you think you got a good chance?
<user0> i do not know, i feel like i have done all I can to get it, but you never know
<user1> That's all you can do, but if you worked hard, I'm sure you will get it!
<user1> Oh cool. Were there any good picture in there?
<user0> So many good pictures. It was great reliving all of those old memories, many I had forgotten about.
<user1> Well that's nice. I am glad they were happy memories for you. 
<user1> Oh boy.  I've gotten quite a few of those before.  New hairstylist?
<user0> no, same style from my barber who always cuts my hair, for some reason he did a terrible job
<user1> That's odd.  I would've told him so and asked for my money back. 
<user1> Ohhhh, disgusting.  What did you do?
<user0> first i did not know what it was, than i realized it was a fly, i was about to throw up
<user1> I bet, what a terrible feeling!
<user0> i know, flies are filthy creatures  and plus they produce maggots, yuck
<user1> Oh man, your making it even worse.  I never even thought about that.  Now I want to throw up.
<user0> 5
<user0> is there anything that you can do to help prepare yourself?
<user1> i think i'm ready but it is the waiting  to give it , I just want it to be over
<user0> yeah i can understand that!! id want to get it over with too. the sooner the better
<user0> Oh my, I hope that doesn't mean more workload for you.
<user1> Yeah, I hope we don't get a ton of work while they're gone
<user0> Maybe you should ask for overtime pay just in case you do get more work!
<user0> Yeah, flying can be scary.
<user1> i know, just the idea of being in a plane up in the sky, scares the bejesus out of me
<user0> Hopefully it isn't a long flight.
<user0> thats awesome that you trust her
<user1> yeah she is a great person.  she is a little younger than me.
<user0> its hard to find good people you can trust with your kids nowadays
<user0> Oh no! Thats horrible. Were you driving?
<user1> No, it was some person driving recklessly!
<user0> Oh Gosh that is horrible. I am so sorry that happened to you.
<user0> That's the worst! Because now you'll be freaking out trying to think of the things you may not even remember whether or not could have been there. That must be an anxious feeling. 
<user1> It really is, it just sucks losing all of those things. They were like my connection to the past.
<user0> Yeah, I'm not quite a hoarder or a packrat when it comes to those things, but I do get sentimental with some physical objects. If I lost them, I'd feel like it would be an itch I couldn't scratch, because I couldn't replace what I lost. Hopefully you can work past it somehow.
<user0> Oh man, thats the best feeling in the world. Getting out of a shower especially if its into clean freshly laundered sheets.
<user1> Yes! I feel like a new person!
<user0> It's such a wonderful feeling, I should take a shower soon too.
<user0> How did you you go over your budget?
<user1> i spend it like maniac i am so disappointed in myself...
<user0> I hope you can have better self-control in the future.
<user0> awww. that is good news!
<user1> i know! i am so happy about this! and i really can't wait, we are going to go on a cable car too
<user0> how long has it been seen youve seen each other?
<user0> Oh gosg. Do you have some greedy roommates or something?
<user1> just greedy? more than that, who the hell finishes a whole 500g of coffee in 3 days !
<user0> Hahahaa good point. Maybe try hiding your groceries.
<user0> yea i have
<user1> me too, she's recently going through a lot and despite all that, she's working hard everyday for us and i am just so happy and lucky to have her
<user0> thats great, happy for yo
<user0> literally me right now actually
<user1> same, it's just such a slow day too, but one thing that is making me hopeful is tht next week i am going to travel to see fiance
<user0> must be nice to have someone that loves you
<user0> What is going on with your work?
<user1> i had an assignment to submit but i didn't submit it on time, i am so disappointed in myself 
<user0> You can do better next time I believe in you!
<user0> Ouch.  Why? 
<user1> because  i am a very faithful person and i trust in my god!
<user0> Oh I see.  Very interesting that your faith makes you want to die though.
<user0> its not so bad, it can be intimidating but you just need to figure out the campus layout and classes but its very smooth from there
<user1> i hope i won't get lost but i'm so bad with that, i always get lost. 
<user0> once you figure the way it just becomes routine
<user0> You are so right, did you read that somewhere?
<user1> no, i just came up with this philosophy while facing an existential dilemma 
<user0> That is cool, have you studied any philosophy in school?
<user1> No, i study it in my free time
<user1> Yes, I feel that every day.
<user0> it's the most amazing feeling ever right? it feels like the universe gives us everything.
<user1> I wish people understood how precious life really is.
<user1> Why did you throw your laptop?
<user0> because i was very pissed off, i wasn't able to work .
<user1> Sometimes I lose my temper like that too.
<user1> wow thats vivid, what game was this?
<user0> league of legends, my other addiction, other than my fiance 
<user1> ah yes league, love hate relationship with that game but after 4 years it can really still tilt me more and more
<user1> Oh no, I hope it wasn't an important meeting.
<user0> it was actually, and because of the traffic i couldn't make it
<user1> Sorry to hear that, were they understanding about it?
<user1> I'm sorry your wife is sick.  What kind of soup is it?
<user0> it's called lentil soup and we make it a special way with cumin spice and love 
<user1> That sounds quite delicious if I must say.
<user1> Yeah.  reminds me of the good old days!  
<user0> for me it's when you get more than just nostalgia, when you get sad, happy and sentimental 
<user1> Yeah same here.  I remember one time awhile back I took some pictures of when the aliens landed in my backyard.   That was some good times!
<user1> Yikes, that's a tough one and I can definitely feel your pain on the job market. I think either network your way to a higher pay job (depends on connections) or possibly go back to school to a doctorate or certain specialist degrees.
<user0> ummm? excuse me? do you know people earn a lot from computer science, it is not my degree for sure, it's this corrupt world we live in that's the problem
<user1> Yes but the market is quite flooded with CS degree holders. It's hard to get something unless you are specialized I think. Unfortunately I don't see society changing any time soon.
<user1> Life is the most beautiful thing.
<user0> are you happy with the way things are? i am enjoying every second
<user1> I live every day like it's my last.
<user1> Waiting in line is the worst.
<user0> but it was in the line for university classes, i am so jealous 
<user1> I hope you got your classes.
<user1> Sounds like you are pretty confident in yourself!
<user0> yup i am !  so so confident and i think this is a good trait to have
<user1> I agree that it is as well. In most situations, it can work to one's benefit.
<user1> I don't understand what you are trying to tell me. Is this a joke?
<user0> no, i am angry! imagine every morning you wake and someone in your family takes your shoes because they want to make you angry
<user1> Why would they want to do that?
<user0> like i said to  make me angry, they are selfish and jealous
<user0> I can imagine the flood of emotions.
<user1> yup, many memories from the past, the good, the bad
<user0> I hope it was worth visiting.
<user0> Sounds like you are prepared. I like the confident attitude. Go get them!
<user1> i'll sure do that, it's going to be fun too, do you go to social events?
<user0> I would love to come with you to yours. LOL, I just invited myself.
<user0> I completely understand. Maybe you need a vacation to recharge the batteries.
<user1> maybe, but i also need a plan because if i continue like this, i won't get anywhere for reals
<user0> Are you looking for a new job?
<user0> That's not true I'm sure. Do you have any friends to hang out with?
<user1> no, i don't like people, they make me lose more hope in the plane
<user0> I can understand. Maybe connect with some like-minded people online? 
<user0> ewww that's gross!  Did you help clean it up?  And what was in that pizza anyway??
<user1> god knows what was in that pizza, but i helped clean and the mess was still showing, but he said it wasn't a problem 
<user0> He seems like a good friend.  
<user0> The future certainly can be scary.
<user1> are you not scared of the future?
<user0> I am curious for what the future holds.
<user0> Oh wow, the whole cake? Has she found out yet? Was she mad?
<user1> she hasn't yet, we're suppose to have it later tonight, but how disappointed she'll be when she comes back from work and sees that the cake has been entirely devoured by me... 
<user0> If you can and have time, I'd try to get a quick replacement and explain to her. Maybe she'll understand.
<user0> Oh cool.  How does it work?
<user1> it seperates the ascii values of each character and adds them up to give a number, then it divides  them by their length and then it does something else which i will keep a secret :P
<user0> Oh that's easy peasy.  Sometimes I only have to wipe once when I go number 2.  
<user0> Oh man, I would be so jealous. When will it be your turn? 
<user1> i am envying them. i don't know , i'm working very hard as well.
<user0> I think your boss should give you more recognition in that case!
<user0> That's good!  You're awesome!  Family is what is important
<user1> family should always come first. 
<user0> I agree!  
<user0> ready for all those ice breakers? those amazing crazy party? what are you hoping to do this year?
<user1> i am really hoping i can make some good friends, and just learn about everything i don't know a lot about you know?
<user0> yeah defiantly, my best advice to you is to learn and focus on your studying and always expand in knowledge that's the one thing we seniors always wish we had done   
<user0> what? what happend? why are you angry?
<user1> i'm angry because my mom and my sister had a fight and they aren't talking together. that made me very mad.
<user0> really? was it about something very stupid?
<user0> I think that's a kind of natural reaction, especially if it is just a hobby. I would have a fear of being judged.
<user1> Exactly!  I always feel there's less chance of embarrassment if you're the best in the room.
<user0> Definitely. I feel the same speaking foreign languages. It's more of a self-conscious thing.
<user0> that does sound like fun! where do you guys plan on going?
<user1> well, we are going to turkey! i've heard some good things about that country i'm very excited
<user0> that sounds like a good time. not the usual country you see people vacation to
<user0> That's awesome! It's so good that you have such a positive outlook on everything.
<user1> isn't it? i don't see negative things in life, i try to always look at the bright side.
<user0> I think you have the perfect outlook. I hope I can strive to maintain something like that as well.
<user0> what did he do yolo?
<user1> he couldn't keep his promise with me. he said he was going to get me pepsi max but he didn't and that made me sad.
<user0> this is absolutely the worst! he is no man in my eyes!
<user0> Oh, yuck! That's gross. Did you get sick too?
<user1> i didn't, but no one was home and i had to clean that up :(
<user0> that's rough! My husband always did with the kids when he was home.
<user0> don't be! i know this is overused but trust me, it's not as hard as everyone else makes it to be, if you focus and aim for your goals, you will get it! i know you can do it!
<user1> that was very needed , thank you so much, i was really stressed because of it.
<user0> don't be, i am sure your fiance will always be right next to you and help you out
<user0> It really is, what can we do to help?
<user1> i don't know maybe starting by stop using all those cars ? i don't know i wish we could do something.
<user0> That'd be a good idea, we could all start biking.
<user0> What was the project?1
<user1> the project that i worked on was to deliver a marketing speech for healthy eating
<user0> You must be an expert on nutrition then!
<user0> What are you looking forward too?
<user1> i am going to see my fiance who lives in adifferent country 
<user0> Which country? that sounds fun, are you guys doing anything fun there?
<user1> candaa
<user1> yeah. it would be best to check the website for a list of approved items
<user0> the website says yes! but my friends say they don't know if that's accurate so i think i need to double check once i am there
<user1> yes. hopefully all will go well
<user1> Are you his best man?
<user0> well , i consider him my brother, i don't know if he thinks the same, we grew up together.
<user1> I hope he does, being the best man is an honour and you're ready for it.
<user1> sounds quite interesting to code
<user0> it sure is! i used genetic algorithm as well as k-means and neural netwroking
<user1> oh dang i never really dabbled that deep when i did my small share of programming
<user1> What happened?
<user0> nothing so far, but it's what migh thappen in the future
<user1> I hope all goes well so you're as happy as possible.
<user1> That's good! I hope you had a good time?
<user0> well it brought back a lot of memories, and it felt nice to see her after all those years.
<user1> Yes, it's great when you run into an old friend you haven't saw for a long time. 
<user1> What are you planning on doing with it?
<user0> build a life with my fiance and grow together and gain more and more knowledge 
<user1> That sounds so admirable, I'd love to see you grow to an amazing person.
<user1> why don't you go get yourself some food? or just order some?
<user0> i have, but the wait is so real you know?
<user1> oh god i get you! waiting for your food to arrive is real torture.
<user1> wow, spooky, what did you do next?
<user0> i just walked past it.
<user1> that must have startled you 
<user1> You having money problems?
<user0> yeah! but i still ordered but the food delivery isn't here yet
<user1> I don't think I've ever had a delivery guy be that late. I'd be mad.
<user1> Oh, that stinks...literally! I have pets too so I know how you feel. My cat will eat too much sometimes and throw up!
<user0> it's the worst right?... really made me so so so mad
<user1> It is, I wished they could just use the toilet like we do!
<user1> thats good! nothing wrong with hard work and dedication
<user0> and seeing her reaching her goals and growing so much makes me so happy.
<user1> that does have to feel really good
<user1> Yes, where do you live?
<user0> I live in Colorado with the mountains and fresh air with so many wonderful outdoor activities available.
<user1> I love Colorado. I visit all the time.
<user0> It is great any time of the year. There are so many cool things to do even in the snowy winters.
<user0> Yeah, we have a lot to be thankful for.  We take for granted many of the perks of being a US resident!
<user1> That is for sure! I just wish other countries were the same. There are so many people suffering all over the world.
<user0> I agree. There is a lot of suffering.  I am glad people like you and I recognize that.
<user0> That is great. Where are you selling your popsicle?
<user1> From my house and from a few local stores. I am not ready to make it any bigger than that.
<user0> I understand. Good luck.
<user0> You were probably just being you.
<user1> No, I think somebody wants something... I am just waiting to hear it, lol.
<user0> Haha! That's usually the case. : )
<user0> I understand. Is your family living far from New York?
<user1> Yes, a plane ride away. But there was also a lot of cool things to see. I think it was a good experience but it would be better with friends and family.
<user0> It is always cool to have family and friends close by.
<user0> That is a great mindset to have!  You must feel very happy and content!
<user1> Yes, when I am in nature. :) But when I come to the big cities I feel like it is the devils playgrounds
<user0> Why do cities make you feel that way?
<user1> Because they are filled with concrete and pollution and unhappy people.
<user1> Oh no.. and no one really likes pumping gas. 
<user0> I just seem to forget until I get home. Oh well I will just have to give her some money again instead. Oh she is going to be angry.
<user1> You could grab it when shes done with it and fill it up real quick for her! 
<user0> Nah, I will just give her the money and endure the pain. Haha
<user0> Did you give it back or just walk away?
<user1> i did not find out untill i got home, the store is kind of far and I think I'm going to keep it, but it's eating on my conscious because of that
<user0> Yeah, that is a hard one to deal with.  Maybe you should give it back so you will not feel bad about yourself.
<user0> I would ask the realtor on some background and even google the address to see if any abuse headlines come from that place. 
<user1> That is a good idea. It is such good deal and I think it would not need much money to fix it up. But a ghost in the house is definitely a deal breaker!
<user0> Kinda makes you think even more since its such a good deal that people are just like get rid of it - deff look into it! 
<user0> I'm sorry to hear that...sometime you just have stop and take a deep breathe so you don't get overwhelmed.
<user1> Yeah, I know. But in the moment it is hard. I guess I am just a very emotional person. Maybe I need theraoy, lol.
<user0> Therapy is a good thing. Its is nothing to be ashamed of.
<user0> Maybe it isnt your body, but also your partners! Something to check into to see which end its coming from, but none the less it will happen! 
<user1> Yeah, more people are having these issues these days. I think it may be true that someone may be poisoning us through the water and food or something! It is a scary world!
<user0> It's hard to trust anything, even the oatmeal recently was put on the news that its high in cancer causing pest spray. 
<user0> Thats kind of you, did everything go well when you put it back into the wild? 
<user1> The duck flew away and was never to be found again. Hopefully he was reunited somehow with his family. I just hope so.
<user0> Sounds like it went well! 
<user0> Yes, I hate those kind of people. They have nothing to do expect lying about other people.
<user1> Yeah, it is very hurtful. But what can one do? Get back at them? It just seems like you would go to their level. I guess it is better to just swallow it and move on.
<user0> I just ignore them. At some point, they stop but they understand that it is not working.
<user0> I'm sorry to hear that. I hope he is feeling better. 
<user1> He is, i hated missing work, but that the sort of thing a person has to do for their children.
<user0> It is. Taking care of sick child is hard. Missing work is also hard. The things we have to do for our children.
<user0> Sounds like something on a movie! What a work day right, my god. Bring extras next time? lol 
<user1> Yeah, from now on I will have an extra pair in my desk. Everyone was teasing me all day. It was so annoying!
<user0> I bet they were lol atleast you can laugh about it now. 
<user0> That's very sad, has he considered getting help for his addiction?
<user1> Nope, he doesn't care and denies it's an issue. When I found out, I was too angry to look at him.
<user0> I can certainly understand your feelings, I hope he can somehow fix his habits.
<user0> Has it been a lot of fun?
<user1> Incredibly so. It brought back so many great memories from the times we played on the Xbox 360.
<user0> Oh yeah I remember those old Halo days too during my childhood, such a great game.
<user0> I understand that feeling. It wouldn't make sense for us all to want to do the same things, especially if you've partied before already.
<user1> Yeah, been there done that. I don't miss those hangovers on Sunday morning. Totally not worth it anymore.
<user0> That's cool that you know what you want from life right now and that you don't feel obligated to do things just because of norms.
<user0> Oh that's great! Does it come with a nice raise?
<user1> Yes it did, and much better benefits. Seems like I finally got to the end of a very long road.
<user0> Do you kind of feel like there's no where else to go?
<user0> I am so happy for you! All of your hard work paid off!
<user1> Thanks! For the first time in a long time, the future isn't looking so dark.
<user0> That is great accomplishment! I wish you well on your new path in life!
<user0> Oh my...I hope you didn't hurt yourself.
<user1> Just my pride. My boss and a couple coworkers got a good view of me just flopping into the floor as documents and paperwork went flying.
<user0> Since you didn't hurt yourself I think I will have to laugh. It sounds like it was funny.
<user0> Yea, I feel the same way.  It's worse when you have to pass by them twice a day.
<user1> I have to pass twice a day too. Oh well, I should just be grateful for what I have now. I just can't help that feeling from creeping in though. Maybe I will buy a lottery ticket, lol.
<user0> Heck no.  Be envious that they were lucky enough to have their parents hand down all their money to them.
<user0> Oooh, how exciting!! What kind of car did you get?
<user1> We ordered a new Ford Superduty pickup. This six weeks is taking forever.
<user0> I'll bet it is! Best of luck with your new truck!
<user0> Indoors?
<user1> Nah we were having a barbecue outdoors. 
<user0> In the 6th grade? Where is this school?
<user1> In Quebec. All schools have a budget for extra-curricular activities and events. We had a barbecue once every year in June with free food.
<user0> Makes sense. I live in the states. We have no money for such things.
<user1> That sounds awful, all schools need a budget for activities for the students. Anyways I had no replacement shirt and I had to rinse it out and wear it for the rest of the day; I felt sick.
<user0> How big a bird was this. I dont remember anything from the 6th grade.
<user0> Wow!! That's crazy. I'm like that though. I never win anything either
<user1> I mean I am happy for him and all, but I wouldn't mind some found money either.
<user0> haha right! Maybe you should buy a few and see what happens. You cant win if you don't play
<user0> Oh god, I am so sorry. Is he okay now?
<user1> Sadly, no. He passed away at the vet a few hours later.
<user0> I hate to hear that. It is so hard to lose a pet. I hope you are doing okay through this.
<user0> Do you not fly often? It isnt too bad.
<user1> a couple of time, but it truly scares me
<user0> Well if it is a bigger plane it isnt as bad. Just bring some headphones and listen to some comforting music.
<user0> You have to be more careful next time, maybe you need a calendar to remind you.
<user1> I put an alarm on my phone, I just get so busy some mornings. At least it didn't affect me too bad until the next morning.
<user0> I am so sorry to hear, I am glad that it didn't cause a lasting effect.
<user0> That is a fantastic feeling. I hope you get it.
<user1> Well I have almost twice the experience as the other two candidates, so I have a really good feeling about it.
<user0> Keep riding that confidence. It will get you places. It sounds like you deserve it.
<user0> That must have been a bit scary, You should have called the police.
<user1> I wasn't too far from my home so I figured I could tough it out. I was pretty scared however, especially since it was nighttime. 
<user0> You cannot be too careful these days, i am so sorry that happened to you.
<user0> Okay! Now that is interested, I would love to see them.
<user1> I think they have them up on their website, you should give them a look! I had them printed for a small fee and now they're up on my wall!
<user0> Oh really? I will be checking it out. I would love to have some.
<user1> Yup. The poster files are free, you just have to get them printed somewhere. They have a few different themes. I got Europa, Trappist-1e, Mars Explorers Wanted and "We Need You"
<user0> Free? That makes it even better, I will be getting me some posters.
<user1> Sweet! I hope you like them as much as I do!
<user0> I hope so too. Thank you so much!
<user0> I am afraid of spiders. I would run and scream. What happened afterwards?
<user1> It ran off somewhere and I couldn't find it, even though I moved most of my furniture. I'm a little scared.
<user0> I would move out of that room. Maybe you need to spray the area.
<user0> Oh no! Did it end up raining? Did you take rain gear?
<user1> It barely did at night, but for the few days we went camping it was nice weather! I'm so thankful that it didn't, because we made a lot of nice memories during our trip.
<user0> That sounds like it was a lot of fun!
<user0> Im sorry to hear that it can be hard ;/
<user1> i know, i am trying to cope but the emptiness is unbearable
<user0> Yeah i would get a pet
<user0> That is so sweet of you. I love cats, you must be a caring spouse.
<user1> I like to think so, thanks! Unfortunately, the cat wanted barely anything to do with me and I felt so isolated.
<user0> The cat didn't like you, oh dear. I am so sorry that happened. You need to spend more time with the cat.
<user0> I have heard that is a common side effect but you might want to talk to your doctor about it
<user1> I have, she said I'm okay because I still have a healthy weight. I've been a skinny boy all my life, and I still am but this extra chub has me feeling down.
<user0> Well you could always work out and turn it into muscle
<user0> Its a good guard dog then
<user1> In a way yes, but not really. As soon as anyone ENTERS the house, he turns into a huge lovable pup and wants them to pet him. He's such a nuisance but I love him.
<user0> What kind of dog is he
<user1> A Brittany Spaniel.
<user1> Animal accidents can be really bad!
<user0> I felt so bad for the poor cow. It seems no one was hurt except the cow. :( The car was pretty damaged though.
<user1> At least no one else was injured, but it is sad about the cow. 
<user1> Just cherish the moments
<user0> I will, but just the thought of it makes me blue
<user1> It will be okay
<user1> What kind of job is it
<user0> It's an online teaching position and I feel so good about myself. 
<user1> That is a nice job I am sure
<user1> Uh oh! Did you get in trouble?
<user0> No, but I felt like a jerk when I gave it to them the next day and had to explain what happened.
<user1> That is good that you gave it back and were able to admit your mistake. I am sure they appreciate that.
<user1> Awesome, congrats! I'm not too familiar with the Oculus Rift, is there a particular game you're eager to play?
<user0> Hmm maybe Robo Recall, a game about fighting robots. Otherwise I have to find out what games are available!
<user1> Robot games are always fun. I bet you'll have a great time!
<user1> Ooh how so? Were there a lot of hills and sharp turns?
<user0> Yep, exactly. I also have a new bike so between the new route and the new bike, I was totally terrified of wiping out. So I took it slow.
<user1> I see. Do you think you'll be going back on that bike trail?
<user0> Absolutely! And now that I know it better, I won't be so scared. I'm heading back out there Tuesday, can't wait!
<user1> I hope you have tons of fun and enjoy a safe trip!
<user1> What kind of con was it
<user0> Otakuthon 2018. It's about anime, Japanese culture and videogames. I was volunteering for the MSI booth (a PC-Gaming company).
<user1> that is really cool! I like in Texas so i cant go to stuff like that
<user0> That's a shame. Anyways, I haven't made any friends in well over a year because I'm awful in social situations.
<user0> That sounds amazing!  How did everyone do?
<user1> Pretty good. The hardest part for most of us was the blind trust fall, but in the end most of us learned to put faith in each other.
<user0> Awesome!  Hopefully what you guys learned in the ropes course translates over into the workplace.
<user0> Why did you do tht?
<user1> She's very trustworthy and I knew she wouldn't steal from me. It was also something she needed and didn't have the money to get it yet.
<user0> That makes sense, you are a good older sibling!
<user1> Thanks for the compliment! But she's also a great younger sibling!
<user1> I would imagine, that is a lot to drink!
<user0> It really is. I felt so bad about my actions, but it hasn't stopped me from doing it at least one other time.
<user1> I get that, well I hope you feel betternow!
<user1> why is that?
<user0> My parents never saw the importance I guess. 
<user1> I get that, did your friends know how to ride bikes?
<user0> They did, but I was always too scared and not confident enough in myself. I thought I would fall and really hurt myself.
<user1> Well it is never hard to learn if you give it a shot
<user1> Aww that's sweet. Did you cry?
<user0> I almost did. It was hard holding the tears back.
<user1> Why hold them back? It okay to cry lol
<user1> Oh, I am so sorry! I used to have a dog we loved so much who had diabetes...we gave him insulin shots twice a day but we lost him. I can relate to how you feel... 
<user0> It really sucks. It's fairly common in cats and I sort of knew the diagnosis was coming but that doesn't make it any easier. I'm sorry to hear about your dog.
<user1> Our pets are our family...it's not easy to see them suffer..I feel for you. And thank you about our dog.
<user1> Oh no,  what happened?
<user0> They had tried to commit suicide. It was very hard to hear but thankfully they are getting the help they need.
<user1> That is terrible, you must have been devastated,  I hope he find the help he/she needs.
<user1> Oh dear, but are you allowed to sing at work? That must be so annoying.
<user0> it really is, he thinks he knows how to sing, i would not be so annoying if he knew how to sing 
<user1> He needs to just sing in the shower. Tell him to quit singing.
<user1> Haha no way, I thought that only happens in cartoons!
<user0> Yep, everyone was laughing at me
<user1> I'm sorry but I probably would have, too. Hopefully you didn't get hurt though!
<user1> That is unfortunate, is he doing any chemotherapy ?
<user0> I'm not entirely sure of the regimen, I didn't want to ask too many questions. But I've been bringing pre-cooked meals over for her and her husband when I get a chance to help them out a little.
<user1> Well I hope everything works out for him!
<user1> What were you waiting for!
<user0> I was waiting for my computer monitor!
<user1> Nice!  The anticipation must have been killing you!
<user1> How well did it work out for you?
<user0> Oh it worked fine, but when I pulled my laundry out it surprised me how the smell of that soap reminded me of my life all those years ago when I used it regularly. Isn't it weird how scents can do that?
<user1> Wow!  That is such a great feeling!  I love when good memories come back to me!
<user0> Right? I didn't expect that could happen with laundry soap!
<user0> o no what did you do?
<user1> I slapped him and beat up the other women
<user0> o no im not sure that was the best response
<user0> Oh No! Did you get hurt?
<user1> Well, physically not so much, just a light scrape on my knee. But man my pride got wounded bad!
<user0> I bet that was a little embarrassing. 
<user0> Don't be embarrassed. You know that you had a problem and you are better now for it
<user1> Right. Not much that can be done about it now. I enjoy having more money now though for sure!
<user0> That's understandable. I wish you the best in staying smoke free!
<user0> That is great to hear that things are going well for you.
<user1> Thanks that means a lot to me!
<user0> I am sure that things will continue to go smooth since you have a positive attitude about it.
<user0> How long has it been since the interview?
<user1> That's the thing, my anxiety and excitement started the moment I first talked to the company, it was driving me crazy. But I ended up getting the job!
<user0> Oh well congrats and good job!
<user0> Oh that is awesome for your friend!
<user1> Oh totally. I'm happy for her but part of me was also a little envious, I hate to admit.
<user0> Yeah I can understand that. I would feel the same.
<user1> Well good, I don't feel so bad about it then. I thought I was being a bad friend!
<user1> That was probably not a good idea, how did it go for you?
<user0> It actually worked out amazing! I knew going into it that I'd practiced a lot and had built up my skills, so I was sure I could do it even if I was a little hesitant.
<user1> Well, you never know if you can do something till you try. I am glad you were able to do so well.
<user1> That can be kind of scary. How did it go?
<user0> It went great. I having put in all the work ahead of time to get ready, I knew exactly how to answer the questions they had for me. 
<user1> Awesome, congratulations! It just goes to show how great things can happen when you're prepared.
<user1> Good job.  Your coworker sounds like a shady little b**ch did you let him/her know what's up
<user0> I found them and gave them a piece of my mind. What kind of person does something like that.
<user1> For real.  Glad you had enough self-respect to handle it, most people dont'
<user1> Aww haha how many bags did you bring
<user0> It honestly wasn't *that* much stuff, I packed it well. But the joke's on him, he felt dumb for making fun of me after we needed a bottle opener and I just so happened to pack one.
<user1> Heey there you go...sounds like you're the resourceful one
<user1> That sounds awful!
<user0> Yeah, it's really irritating. I don't mind people having fun but come on, every single night? It's really ticking me off.
<user1> Have you tried talking to them about it?
<user0> Yes, I casually mentioned condo rules on noise and asked them to at least try and keep it down on weekdays.
<user0> I don't think that I have seen/heard one of those since the 90s... Possibly the early 2000's at the earliest! Crazy, I didn't know that they still exist either!
<user1> Right? Seeing the kids come running out really made me miss when I was little and got all excited about the ice cream man!
<user0> I loved that too!
<user0> That is wonderful to hear, good for you. There's way too much craziness in the world making people unhappy. It's nice to hear someone is doing well and happy.
<user1> Agreed. I have to actively distance myself away from the drama of reality but doing this makes me happier. Not sure if this is ideal but that's ok!
<user0> Distancing yourself from the negative things sounds like a totally healthy way to insulate yourself from that stuff.
<user0> Aw, that must have brought up a lot of nostalgia for you. 
<user1> It really did. Seeing all those old faces I haven't seen for years. It was a great experience.
<user0> Did you share it with anyone else?
<user0> Nice, a step up is always such a relief. Do you feel confident you'll get the job?
<user1> Some, I did well in the interview. Just trying to keep spirits up while they make their decision.
<user0> Well I hope you get it. Good luck!
<user0> That's great. How long are you going to have to wait?
<user1> Not sure, hopefully I hear this upcoming week. I feel pretty good about my chances so that's making the waiting a little easier.
<user0> I am glad you are so confident about your prospects. I hope you hear something very soon from them.
<user0> I think we've all been there...I've done my fair share of dumbassery
<user1> I feel it. Most of the bad decisions were fun, at least.
<user0> Ha YOLOOO
<user0> I know right! I noticed leaves on the ground the other day and got all excited! Is autumn your favorite season, too?
<user1> Yes! My absolute favorite! It's not too cold and not too hot and there is so much beauty all around! It is soon time to get all the winter clothes out.
<user0> I don't mind winter either but you're so right, the temperature is just right during fall.
<user0> Awe, sorry to hear that. I am sure you did better than you think.
<user1> Well, not really according to analytics. I was really let down by the fact that it was a flop but I'm not going to let it drag me down too much.
<user0> That is a good attitude. Better luck next time!
<user0> I was doing the same thing!  Hard work but so satisfying when you see the results!  Who is coming to stay?
<user1> Yes, there is no better satisfaction, in my opinion, than a clean house. :) My sister is visiting with her kids. They are staying for a week here at my house. I am sure the house is going to be trashed in the end.
<user0> I completely agree.  Mine can get trashed in 10 minutes flat from the kids.  ha ha. Oh, how fun!  I hope you have a wonderful time!  Yeah, you'll probably be cleaning all over again by the end of it but its worth it.
<user0> That sounds pretty disturbing.  Have you called the cops?
<user1> No but that might be a good idea. It's just an awkward and gross situation.
<user0> I bet.  I wonder what he is thinking.
<user0> I certainly hope so,  Why do you want to move?
<user1> I am moving to a smaller house with a big yard where life will be a lot easier. Less house to clean and more time outside. :)
<user0> That sounds great, That is how I like my houses to be too.
<user0> Hmm, don't you need fat and protein in your diet also?
<user1> I have done a lot of research and so many fruitarians are thriving and feeling the best they ever had in their life. There is fat in avocados and avocados are considered a fruit..
<user0> Oh I hadn't even thought of avocado. Well good luck with the diet, I hope it works for you!
<user0> Oh wow! That is a brave thing to do! Your letter must have been a little intense if you are worried how they will take it. How did it work out?
<user1> Yep, it was full of emotion and a lot of things I needed to get off my chest. I was quite nervous waiting for a response but it turns out I had nothing to worry about. She was really glad I spoke up!
<user0> Awe that is great! I am glad there was a happy ending!
<user0> Oh man I'd be mad too...you should wait outside with a paintball gun 
<user1> Yeah! I wish I had the time for it! I am going to buy one of the web cams and catch them in the act. I am going to teach them a lesson! But I love the paintball idea! That is great! 
<user0> Yup gotta lay down the law
<user0> Terrifying! What was it?
<user1> It turned out to be the sump pump, I guess it was old. But yes, it scared the daylights out of me!
<user0> Oh good. I bet!  I wouldn't have been able to go back to sleep after that!  Do you have to replace the pump?
<user1> I did, yeah. It was actually still in working condition but I couldn't stand the sound and I'm a light sleeper. No more scary noises at 3am!
<user1> Oops. I hate when that happens. Did they say anything to you?
<user0> No, but the person who told him confessed. So I decided to be the bigger person and apologize to my coworker before things got too out of hand. He actually wasn't that upset and appreciated that I owned up to it, but I still felt bad for it, mostly that I did it behind his back.
<user1> That was really nice of you to apologize like that. Some people would have just ignored it. I know that could have been embarrassing.
<user1> that sounds exciting! Do you bike a lot?
<user0> I've only recently started getting really into it. It sounds kind of corny but getting out there on my bike makes life just really... satisfying. Calm.
<user1> Doesn't sound corny. We all need a hobby to relieve stress!
<user1> How come you can't take them anymore?
<user0> they are all grown up. 
<user1> Awww, well maybe you'll have grandchildren that you can take one day!
<user1> That's intense. I hope you did well!
<user0> I did! I got an A and I am so proud and happy !
<user1> Congratulations! That's great news. Well deserved
<user1> I totally understand. The same thing happened to me last week. I thought I was going to lose it!
<user0> i understand the dog is being a dog, but the owner does nothing about it even when i tell him about it
<user1> Right, I had to end up calling the homeowners association on them
<user1> Wow that is very clever. I would have never thought that could happen.
<user0> Right? I wasn't even mad about it, I was astounded by his ingenuity.
<user1> That is incredible. I wonder what else you can train him to do.
<user0> Well he also taught himself how to use a toilet so who knows!
<user0> That is great! Hopefully he continues to be
<user1> I think he will. He puts up with me, and sometimes i can be a pill!
<user0> Lol i'm sure you have to put up with him as well so its even
<user0> Oh no. That's so sad. Was she sick for long?
<user1> Not really. She was old and we woke up one day and she could not use her back legs. It was very sad.
<user0> I'm sorry. At least she had a good long life.
<user0> That is awful! Did you have insurance to cover everything?
<user1> Thankfully, yes!! It took several months to replace everything that I could -- but even things, so many things I just simply couldn't replace. 
<user0> Yeah that is horrible. I am sorry that happened to you. 
<user0> Oh no! I hope you didn't get into too much trouble by doing so!
<user1> Thankfully, not too much! I was simply mortified because this was one of my main responsibilities and I managed to mess that one up so badly!
<user0> To be fair, everybody makes mistakes and it's bound to happen even to the best of us!
<user0> Sounds like that could be fun if you like your brother and if you like parties. Do you want to go?
<user1> I just came back from it! I'm actually still a little intoxicated. I must say it was a lot of fun, we celebrated my birthday and I felt very loved and happy.
<user0> Happy Birthday! I'm glad you were able to have fun and be surrounded by those that love you.
<user1> Thank you so very much! I appreciate the sentiment.
<user1> What was her reaction to that
<user0> She was a little sad and surprised, but we had been talking about threesomes for a long time now so she understood. Regardless, I felt very ashamed the next day.
<user1> I am sure she will forgive you
<user0> She already has. We both think of these type of things so all is good.
<user0> That sounds like some nice relaxing quality time
<user1> It really is! it's the only time in the day that we're guaranteed to have some time together, just us. 
<user0> Have you ever passed out together watching tv?
<user1> Not yet - but I'm sure it'll happen at some point!
<user0> How old is your baby?
<user1> 8 months old - but by looking at him, you'd think he was a two-year-old. Thanks for asking!
<user0> And how long have you been married?
<user0> that is exciting! will it be your first house?
<user1> Well it would have been, but someone got a bid in before us and it ended up being sold. My wife was so sad.
<user0> that is no good! hopefully yall will find a better one
<user0> You must really trust your friend! How did that turn out?
<user1> It was good, he (the dog) seemed really happy when I got back. He said that he let my dog out a bunch and even took him to the park!
<user0> Good to hear that it went so well. Do you think you'll let your friend watch him again?
<user1> Absolutely. He has proved himself to be trustworthy when it comes to important stuff.
<user1> Oh no, what did you do?
<user0> I started coughing--badly. He and everyone else stopped to look at me and make sure I was okay. He was so distracted after that!
<user1> Don't worry, from what you said it doesn't sound like you almost ruined it. It wasn't something on purpose at least.
<user1> Lol that makes a lot of sense?
<user0> Yeah I had a few hints. My expectations were somewhat true; my brother's friend celebrated not only my birthday party, but two other birthdays today. It was wonderful!
<user1> well that sounds fun!
<user0> It really was. I was so happy!
<user0> Haha caught red handed!
<user1> We proceeded to leave the restaurant, but not after informing the manager, very loudly, about the incident. 
<user0> Yeah, I wonder what their bathrooms are like if that's their service
<user0> Don't worry about it you will do fine. Kindergarten isn't too hard. Just don't eat the glue.
<user1> Lmao. It's actually my junior year of mech engineering.
<user0> Oh I see. My mistake. I was wondering how you could type and spell so well for a 6 year old. Well good luck in college!
<user1> Thanks lol. I wish I could type this well at 6 years old.
<user1> Did he try to get another diploma in this profession area?
<user0> Well, he has a masters degree and graduate certificate already. He's had a fourth interview for a position last Thursday -- so we are hoping this one will finally be the one!
<user1> That is a good news. I hope he get it.
<user1> Surgery on my kids always scares me but I have heard that it is best to have them taken out while they are young
<user0> Yeah, I was terrified. I just wandering around the waiting room the entire time till they came and told me everything went fine. Seemed like it took days.
<user1> I understand, when it comes to our kids and being worried about them it feels like time stand still
<user1> Oh for sure. I hate having to cook and do dishes after a long hard day
<user0> Exactly! My boyfriend brought me dinner the other night. I had no groceries and just didn't feel like going out after a long stressful day. I was so thankful.
<user1> Were at work today or doing something else?
<user1> Interesting. How do you feel about it? Do you find it fun and interesting, or wish she were more responsible with her money?
<user0> Mostly I'm a bit frustrated that she's got so much money to blow on these concerts! And to travel all across the country!
<user1> Yeah, I can understand that. Sometimes when you're not in a position to enjoy yourself because you're busy being tied down with responsibilities, it's easy to get mad at others. Whatever you can do to spin it positively, I would suggest that. Being negative about it will only make everyone's lives worse.
<user1> Oh my gosh!  That had to be super scary!
<user0> It sounded like a train going by the house from the basement. Thankfully no one was hurt.
<user1> Yeah, thank god you are safe.  I don't know what I would have done if that happened to me.
<user1> Yep I thinks its disrespectful and petty. What happened? 
<user0> He was talking about my other friend who is a bit annoying sometimes. While I may agree I just don't like talking behind someones back.
<user1> Thats good. I am amazed by people who think its okay to do that. 
<user0> Yeah I feel like not everyone is as moral as me. But that's pretentious which is ironically amoral.
<user0> Sounds like your co workers respect you then
<user1> They seem to. Or, at least, they know whom is the right person to go to for those specific kinds of questions!
<user0> Or that as well ha
<user0> Did you ever get caught?
<user1> My mother found out and made me walk them back into the store and give them to the manager. That was a humbling experience.
<user0> Was she disappointed?
<user0> How many month earlier he came?
<user1> It was actually only a week--but he wasn't showing signs of being physically ready was the problem. Thankfully, I'd already had my bags packed for weeks so we went to the hospital ready!
<user0> Is he healthy?
<user1> In the end, yes--growing too big is actually his problem now!
<user1> whatwas the exam for?
<user0> It was for Organic Chemistry
<user1> tha is really cool what was your grade
