<user1> no the person doesn 't say anything
<user1> no , he doesn 't make any noise other than the strange laugh .
<user1> it kind of looks like it but not so much because the staircase is inside a home .

<user1> yes he unzips it and tosses it to the side .
<user1> he walks into the next room and sets his jacket down and picks up a yellow cup .

<user1> sure , a woman turns on the camera . she takes a few steps . she takes off her hoodie and drops it on the floor . she picks up a notebook and other small item . pretends to sneeze , turns camera off .

<user1> it looks liek he has a jacket
<user1> no other people are there .

<user1> no he doesn 't stare at the broom , he touches it for a bit
<user1> she turns off the camera .
<user1> that is it . there 's nothing more than the one shot of the girl and the angle . i see a window .
<user1> i hear background voice in it
<user1> nothing else she is doing in video
<user1> a man enters a room and closes it behind him and kicks off his shoes and sits on a sofa and after decompressing he gets up and picks up a broom and starts to dust off the floor .
<user1> cannot tell if she is happy or sad . she looks relaxed .
<user1> she has a neutral expression .
<user1> the man is watching an exercise video .
<user1> i don 't know they are speaking spanish
<user1> no , he doesn 't find what he needs in that one , so he closes it .
<user1> its dark out , so i can 't really see anything
<user1> she laughs as she sets the cup down .
<user1> he stays in the frame for the whole video .
<user1> no , she does not go to another room .
<user1> nobody else enters the room .
<user1> i guess she 's on her living room since there 's no bed in it
<user1> yes , she is holding the mug in the beginning .
<user1> that is about it that she did
<user1> oh sorry . i thought she was sitting on a couch . when she is sitting on the toilet she takes off her shoes
<user1> he doesn 't really move , but he does smile .
<user1> yes . they are very excited about the game he is playing
<user1> no it is just that person in the video
<user1> he is standing in a bathroom
<user1> some background noise , but nothing important
<user1> it does not look like it , but it is hard to tell .
<user1> his back is to the camera but he does not appear upset
<user1> no he just pulls the canister out and puts it back .
<user1> yes , i can hear a female voice .
<user1> no he does not laugh . he then reaches to the sink and grabs a plate of food .
<user1> no , he seems to be texting .
<user1> the person does not eat anything in the video .
<user1> no . i think i covered everything that is in the video .
<user1> i am guessing it is the living room since you can also hear a tv
<user1> he is laughing they are having fun
<user1> no only cleaning the couch and coffee table then eaves the room . she consumes nothing .
<user1> all he is doing in the video is putting on a shirt and buttoning it .
<user1> the room is white in color
<user1> i do not think she is wearing pajamas
<user1> the second person turns on a vacuum .
<user1> no , the man is by himself .
<user1> i am sorry , it might be a trampoline . i thought it was an exercise platform . but he doesn 't do anything with it .
<user1> i 'd guess 12-14 years pld

<user1> tiled floor or maybe stained concrete .
<user1> they both stay on the couch the whole time .

<user1> it looks like a small disposable bowl .
<user1> he is the only person shown in the video .
<user1> no she was the only one
<user1> he is holding the bottle the whole time in his left hand , he pours a liquid into it from some other container

<user1> no that is all that happens .
<user1> he sit 's down in the chair and pulls his laptop closer to him .
<user1> when she is on the couch it does look like she looks at the camera .
<user1> the one is taking off her sweater and the other is weilding a vacuum
<user1> it was dark but it looks like a bed and pillow behind him
<user1> i can see one man
<user1> she seems a little aggravated at someone behind her maybe .
<user1> no he does not go to school .
<user1> yes , the man is there the whole time

<user1> nothing much else happens other than that .
<user1> it is hard to tell what kind of medicine it is .
<user1> yes you get a side view of her face near the end .
<user1> yes , first he pulled out the ball , and threw it up in the air and caught it .
<user1> no the man is already there .
<user1> she approaches the camera and does not leave the room
<user1> the man is sitting in a chair .

<user1> no , she just smiles at the beginning .
<user1> he has food in his hand as he 's walking
<user1> he can not fit in the closet , he just picks out the two items .

<user1> he opens his hands towards the mirror
<user1> he flips a light switch and cleans a kitchen shelf
<user1> there are 2 men visible in the video .
<user1> not quite . you can hear what sounds to be a door closing , somewhere .

<user1> he never leaves frame completely , even the very last frame has about half his face .
<user1> maybe liquids that he is drinking .
<user1> yes precisely , the video is mundane
<user1> he goes to another room in the house but i don 't know which room
<user1> it is difficult to tell but possible medicine

<user1> he stands at a distance in the one room eating a sandwich and takes a drink
<user1> she puts the book back and then looks at the card
<user1> she wrapped the pill bottle in the dish towel .

<user1> she took out two pairs of shoes
<user1> he picks them both up at about the same time .
<user1> yes he was holding a glass and drinks from it
<user1> no , but i could hear him eating the chips .
<user1> there are some sounds , but mostly it 's background noise .
<user1> the walls appear to be pink or pinkish white
<user1> i think she is average looking
<user1> no he doesn 't leave the closet
<user1> the only sound is the sound of him tapping his hands on the pillow lovingly as well as his breathing .

<user1> she is just looking at the screen .
<user1> no i can only see to his knees .
<user1> i don ; t know . she doesn 't say .

<user1> they are drinking from mugs that seem to already have liquid in them .
<user1> a man sneezes at the end of the video , that is what i heard .

<user1> she 's sitting on a sofa .
<user1> yes he does show emotion
<user1> she is reading some books
<user1> it looks like an indian bathroom in a village somewhere
<user1> she turns away from the desk as if she is about to walk away .
<user1> he is standing in his pantry area and scanning a can with his cell phone .
<user1> yes at the beginning he holds his head , when saying above words , again like , what a mess .
<user1> you can hear him a little bit .

<user1> she is standing all time
<user1> it starts with him closing the door
<user1> she laugh hysterically for a long time
<user1> he pours milk into a pot and turns the stove on
<user1> no , he just hold the bag in his hands .
<user1> the jacket is black . after putting it on he closes the wardrobe closet .
<user1> i 'm not sure , something in a little shallow silver dish .
<user1> i don 't hear any voices in the video .
<user1> that is about all that happens . the woman with the pillow and blanket reaches down to the camera and the video ends .
<user1> he is holding a mop and a bottle of medicine .
<user1> yes , he walks across the living room .
<user1> no . the man does not talk at all in the video .
<user1> this video is 24 seconds long .
<user1> there are actually 3 people , there 's a woman in the background but she can 't be seen .
<user1> i would say his 30 ' s
<user1> it appears to be some kind of living room off a deck
<user1> he is digging out of an family potrait
<user1> when she gets up from the couch she smiles toward the camera so i would say yes .
<user1> nobody else seems to notice him .
<user1> i think she 's in a living room first .
<user1> yes , thats literally all he does
<user1> he is in a closet
<user1> no he stays in the room
<user1> he just holds them as he passes through
<user1> yes she 's also taking on the phone
<user1> no . i just hear only their voice .
<user1> no , he never trips , or falls .
<user1> sitting down looking towards what must be a tv with the remote in his hand .
<user1> i can see some smile but no laugh as such
<user1> yes he is alone in the room .
<user1> yes , you 've covered the whole thing .
<user1> it was on the top of a chair
<user1> i would say its a young girl .
<user1> just the sound of her moving things a bit .
<user1> no just the stair way
<user1> it 's set in a dining room
<user1> he primps in the tiny mirror that is hanging up just above and to the right of the washing machine
<user1> no she did not she was in just one place

<user1> no he sits on the stairs , wrestles thru the bag , picks up the laptop and puts the lap top in the bag .
<user1> i can see some mess around
<user1> yes there is audio but i don 't hear much .
<user1> no background noise or speech in the film .
<user1> not real quick , but not slow either .
<user1> the main character is holding the mirror while playing with his hair .
<user1> no one else appears in the video .
<user1> just looks at it and talks to the person filming but it is small talk and can not be understood by me .
<user1> she mostly walks around and crotches down
<user1> it is just sitting beside where he ends up sitting down .
<user1> no he just cleans it
<user1> the dog woke her up
<user1> no , he is searching for something .
<user1> yes one person appears to be a child . how did you feel about the video

<user1> ha ha , he is sweeping the floor , grabs a glass of water and keeps sweeping up what is ever on the floor
<user1> yes that is all that happens . he stands there and rubs his chin , looks around and then exits to the right .
<user1> running his fingers through his hair
<user1> i would say this man looks to be in his mid 20s
<user1> the video only shows the one man .
<user1> no its just this boy , he is holding a broom
<user1> he rummaging through his papers and or receipts .

<user1> possibly a kitchen or storage room .
<user1> she only grabs the broom . she already had a rag in her hand when she came in .
<user1> she says absollutely nothing at all
<user1> he was looking at his camera and then his drink .

<user1> there is clothing in the box .
<user1> yes , but i only hear his flip flops when he runs

<user1> she snickers at the end very quickly .
<user1> the man appears to be in his 20s or 30s .
<user1> no he stays there the entire time
<user1> it looks to be a garage or a basement
<user1> i would say like a small living room .
<user1> you can 't tell that much information , it just sounds like the noise of kids .
<user1> one during the entire video .
<user1> the man is in the hallway typing on his phone .
<user1> no , she didn 't come back . the video ended after she disappeared up the stairs .
<user1> i think it sounds like cold water
<user1> he glances in the pantry , and picks up a mirror from the counter and starts looking at himself in the mirror and smiling

<user1> yes he slowly walks in carrying a pillow .
<user1> i don 't know what do you mean by the direction but he is moving from the right to the left
<user1> i can 't make out any audio just noise
<user1> yes there is a flash
<user1> there is no other people except him .
<user1> she is alone through the video
<user1> she seems happy and ends up laughing in the middle and at the end .

<user1> there is one person on the video
<user1> no he is actually alone the whole time
<user1> yes , she turns around and picks a book up off the shelf and flips through it and then drinks some coffee
<user1> that is literally all she does , stands there holding the cup of coffee , taking a sip here and there .
<user1> he washes his hands in the sink right before the video ends .
<user1> i do not see any praying going on
<user1> the boy that comes in looks older

<user1> that is where the video ended .
<user1> he sits down on the stairs and removes his sandals . he then puts tennis shoes on

<user1> a girl walks into a room and places her stack of homework on a self and then leaves the room

<user1> i think he says something at the very beginning but i can 't tell what it was

<user1> a woman walks into her kitchen with a box .
<user1> i can 't tell if he grabs anything metallic or not

<user1> it looks like a living room .

<user1> she does not look at the camera
<user1> a woman is getting maybe a video out of a cabinet .
<user1> before he puts it back he sneezed into his wrist .
<user1> i see one man and one woman .
<user1> he pretends the lighter is a tool .

<user1> maybe , he just lifts the vacuum cleaner
<user1> no no other person appears in the video , and i don 't hear anyone speaking like on a video chat .
<user1> he 's lunging down and tossing something in the cabinet behind him in the beginning .
<user1> a man is eating some food and drinking something .
<user1> no he just walks to the closet
<user1> i can not tell what time of day it is .
<user1> there seems to be a bright spotlight shining in through the doorway . i don 't think there is any light on inside the room .
<user1> he grabbed and walked over to the counter area .
<user1> she nods her head while sneezing .
<user1> no he is not decorating
<user1> there is only one person in the video .
<user1> the display case seems to be filled with small figurines .
<user1> he eventually sits down on a chair

<user1> she is covering her mouth as she sneezes .
<user1> she puts the blanket into a box in the closet .
<user1> he is sitting in the dining room . he takes a laptop off a shelf and walks away

<user1> a girl entered in to room
<user1> no , she isn 't in her pajamas

<user1> he kept sneezing in his hands
<user1> she first turns the light on
<user1> i cannot see a t . v .
<user1> yes , he takes the jacket off and throws it on the floor .

<user1> he is holding a box
<user1> there are two men and a womans voice .
<user1> the man comes into view and begins to slowly ( with a bit of labor ) walk up the stairs while holding the hand rail as he moves forward .
<user1> i think she may be white
<user1> no , he does not pick up anything else other than the food .

<user1> she was not singing in the video . she was not saying anything .
<user1> he has a small bowl in one hand and a wash cloth in the other .
<user1> it looks like an animated video but it is not clear
<user1> no . it sounds like there 's some background talking in the next room , but no one is talking in the kitchen .
<user1> just one person in the video ?
<user1> yes , he grabbed one book and threw it to the opposite side .
<user1> the first man continues up the stairs while the other man sits at the table . that 's pretty much all that happens
<user1> yes , it is only her throughout the video .
<user1> she goes up one or two steps with her back to us and then lays down with her head on a pillow .
<user1> no he just adjusts the lightbulb
<user1> she only looks around at the end .
<user1> he is sitting on the couch looking at a box , then he gets up puts the box on the ottoman and picks up and opens his laptop .
<user1> i can see a man
<user1> yes the man does wash some dishes .
<user1> just music in background but that is it .

<user1> no , he does not speak to anyone .
<user1> she is just standing in the room
<user1> i cannot see the tail , just the head .
<user1> no , the video ends when he throws it in the floor and stands there with a smile on his face .
<user1> he laughs , don 't forget the laughing .
<user1> there 's a coffee cup and a small glass on the dining room table .
<user1> he does adjust the stove the end , but i do not know if he is shutting it off .
<user1> she was already in the room . she turned the camera on in the beginning of the video . she backs away and begins to pace the room .
<user1> no it is just her .
<user1> i couldnt say they look happy
<user1> yes , he finds a bottle , but i don 't know what 's in the bottle .
<user1> yes just one man in the video .
<user1> no the cup is white .
<user1> she was already there at the start .
<user1> he is changing his clothes in front of a mirror
<user1> there is no speaking at all .
<user1> no . he stays at his chair the whole time in the video .
<user1> he turns to his left and a shirt on a hanger off the rack .
<user1> he put it down beside him
<user1> yes , he is alone in the video .
<user1> he picks up a coffee mug from the table on the right side .
<user1> we have covered everything of significance .
<user1> yes , he takes a bite from it .
<user1> there is no broom in this video .
<user1> he did that after hugging a pillow , there is nothing after the running
<user1> no the two people do not talk .
<user1> yes , it appears to be in a house .
<user1> no , that is all that he does .
<user1> a guy was flipping through the pages of a book
<user1> he keeps looking in the mirror and then laughs .
<user1> no i do not see any . i just hear roosters crowing .
<user1> he walks away from the room .
<user1> he is smiling to him
<user1> the blanket is just on his shoulder , he does nothing with it .
<user1> just one person in the video
<user1> no he did not do any of those .
<user1> she picks a pillow up off of what i think is a bed , fluffs it up , and then puts in on a couch .
<user1> you can hear some traffic and the sound of him flipping the pages .
<user1> he starts off cleaning the glass on one window than moves to cleaning a curio cabinet .
<user1> he smiled because he heard something funny from the tv
<user1> yes in that order in the video
<user1> she sits down at the dining table and pulls out a mirror and looks in .
<user1> the two men exchange words and the video ends
<user1> the shoes are already there beside her
<user1> they look to be in between 20 and 30 .
<user1> no , he keeps it in his hand .
<user1> yes . the camera person focuses on each of them intermittently . the guy with the sandwich appears to be in charge as he directs the camera person where to record , and he giggles a lot .
<user1> i don 't see the floor .
<user1> no that is all of it .
<user1> yes she closes the closet door
<user1> he appears to be throwing stuff out that was in it
<user1> he could be indian but definitely not african .

<user1> he puts his shoes on the floor then opens his backpack
<user1> nope , she never leaves her bed and takes a bunch of pics .
<user1> no , i can 't see the clock well enough .
<user1> i believe she is taking a selfie
<user1> no i can 't tell what 's in it .
<user1> he tries to eat or bite off some of the paper towels and then the video ends .
<user1> he gabs a bottle of medicine of the table .
<user1> probably but before she looks in the mirror she has a confused expression
<user1> yes , a little bottle of something .
<user1> it appears to be a female , but you never see her face really .
<user1> yes , she looks young , she hits her elbow on the doorknob before she puts the shoes up in the closet and is really amused
<user1> no he only changes his shirt
<user1> the video starts with the person holding some kind of picture looking at it
<user1> he just stays sitting in the chair for the duration of the video , but he does remove his jacket .
<user1> no , nothing else happens in the video .
<user1> he walks from the hallway where he is at into the kitchen
<user1> after she sets the glass out of sight , she grabs a blanket and wraps it around her neck . she then looks at the camera and takes a bite of food .
<user1> she does and then lays back and smiles into the camera .
<user1> she glances at the directions and then sets them aside .
<user1> he puts the cell phone in his pocket
<user1> ok , i see the television now , i replayed it . no , he does not look at it until he gets done folding the clothes .
<user1> no they are not cooking anything .
<user1> he is washing and cleaning it
<user1> i 'm not understanding the question .
<user1> her face is blocked out when she turns to get the cup and also when she is pouring the drink .

<user1> no , sorry she didn 't interact with the washing machine at all . just the dryer . she took clothing out of the bin and put it into the dryer while stooping down .
<user1> i don 't think it 's a closet . a man is pouring himself a drink .

<user1> he stays laying down throughout

<user1> he was sitting on the floor .
<user1> yes the man walks into a close
<user1> no , she moves a bag in the closet , but she eventually just grabs her cardigan off the chair nearby .
<user1> yes , they are in a bathroom area .
<user1> that can 't be determined from the video , but he 's likely sitting in front of a closet .
<user1> yes he is he has a screwdriver i think working on it
<user1> yes she does appear to be left handed
<user1> he did seem to be working on his homework or something because is writing .
<user1> just a few sounds , like the blanket dropping .
<user1> she never looks at the camera directly .
<user1> he is sitting on shoes the whole time
<user1> no , but he strikes me as the type to ask snarky questions while waiting for others to respond to boring , repetitive questions .
<user1> he starts by wiping something on the wall with a sponge from a bucket and then he turns around and turns off the light on an entry way of a house .
<user1> no , you hit it on the head .
<user1> no , we have covered everything of significance .
<user1> yes he is by hi self in the room
<user1> appears there may be a curtain blowing in the wind on the right side .
<user1> yes he is in the video the entire time
<user1> no on accident and he swears and talks to the kid
<user1> yes he is middle aged .
<user1> she takes a drink of her coffee and looks around
<user1> the entryway and the stairs going to the top of the house and some of a living area .
<user1> no that is all that he does once he gets inside the bathroom .
<user1> there is just one man
<user1> yes , she picks up bread , like a sandwich and her tablet
<user1> no that is all he does .
<user1> no , she yawns but i don 't hear much audio .
<user1> she enters from the left side of the door we can see .
<user1> yes , that is all the action .
<user1> i cant particualarly tell if there is .
<user1> i think it is a bedroom , because it looks like a pillow from a bed .
<user1> yes the man is alone
<user1> nothing significant i can say .
<user1> the video only shows one man .
<user1> he only picks up the 2 shirts .
<user1> it looks sunny out the window so it 's probably daytime .
<user1> yes one in the shower
<user1> it looks more like a living room but there is a blanket and pillow too .
<user1> he seems to be very content
<user1> it might be a bedroom or a living room .
<user1> he reaches on the shelf and organizes the gloves
<user1> you can 't see out the window .
<user1> i can 't tell at all , the video doesn 't show the tv but there 's talking so possibly a movie
<user1> she take the batter out camp cord
<user1> a man is standing in the basement with the dishes in his hands
<user1> he walks in to the door and he has a black bag in his hand
<user1> no , he never goes to the sink
<user1> it looks like he goes through a room with a sink in it , and from there into the bedroom .
<user1> the pajama bottoms are pale blueish grayish color .
<user1> the lady has the broom in her hand the whole time and so does he once he picks it up .

<user1> she is sitting on a bed .
<user1> he is grasping onto a box and looking through it .

<user1> no sound is in the video at all .
<user1> there are two people in the video .
<user1> a guy comes into the room from outside
<user1> a dog walks by her on the left side of the screen . she then gets up and leave the area .
<user1> a boy grabs a chair and moves it over to a cabinet .
<user1> he seems to be a teenager , maybe 17 years old
<user1> yes , but kind of a ways away from the camera .
<user1> he fidgets a bit with an unseen part of the silver machine he 's next to .
<user1> no , the kitchen is not noticeably messy .
<user1> she has dark hair but i can 't tell the color .
<user1> no she does not cook in the clip
<user1> only half of the screen is visible , but it could be a news program or talk show .
<user1> he then goes into the fridge and gets a bottle of milk .
<user1> i can 't tell what nationality he is
<user1> a dark shirt with some blue jeans
<user1> yes , i hear what sounds like a tv playing
<user1> he is kinda happy , nothing is bothering him .
<user1> the older man is adjusting the picture on the wall , and at one point the younger man bends over while clutching the pillow .
<user1> when she opened the window , unlocking the window
<user1> yes , she does seem to be happy .
<user1> yes probably slippers being worn
<user1> he is standing next to a door . his one hand his on the door handle . the other hand he is holding a laptop . he stares at the laptop . than at the end he decides to leave the room .
<user1> not very , hes heavy or so

<user1> yes , and then he takes it
<user1> she 's looking at something on her laptop .
<user1> yes , that is all she got .
<user1> yes he is approaching to leave .
<user1> toward the end , it looks like a hand appears in the lower right frame , but you do not see another person .
<user1> i 'd guess it 's man . but i 'm not too sure .
<user1> i am unable to tell accurately what time it is .
<user1> yes , he walks over to what looks like a day bed and sits down on it
<user1> it looks clean to me
<user1> i can 't tell but it looks like it might be from the thing on the wall .
<user1> looks like the man is in the kitchen
<user1> they are standing in the kitchen .
<user1> after that one bite , he left pretty quickly , so i can 't tell
<user1> he sits on his bed .

<user1> she seems to have no expression the entire time . solemn if anything .
<user1> i just hear the bags moving around .
<user1> he was sneezing and then vacuuming

<user1> yes he is laughing so his mood looks good .
<user1> no he does not sneeze or cough
<user1> a man is playing with a door knob .. maybe trying to fix it but it 's hard to tell .
<user1> she laughs for a short period of time .
<user1> yes , i can hear noises
<user1> i can 't see any facial expressions it 's too dark in the video . his body language looks a little tense but it 's hard to tell if he 's tense or not .

<user1> she has a cat who goes in the closet with her
<user1> she is putting some clothes on the cabinets , throwing a pillow on yhe floor , turning the light off and keaving
<user1> no , he sits clutching the pillow the entire video

<user1> no one else comes into the room .
<user1> yes , the man is alone .
<user1> no , but they do giggle
<user1> yes , it appears to be mid-morning .
<user1> nothing much besides him sitting on the stairs .
<user1> they are speaking in a foreign language
<user1> no , she remains in the kitchen
<user1> there is no definite sound there
<user1> if i had to take a guess on his age i would say no older than 16 years old .
<user1> he appears to actually be reading .
<user1> no i don 't hear audio
<user1> she slowly walks to a door
<user1> no , he takes the sweater off , but was still wearing his shirt .
<user1> you cannot see the skillet 's contents .
<user1> he is standing around trying to figure out the camera

<user1> yes the person is alone
<user1> it is just the one girl
<user1> for a brief moment when she lays back to sleep
<user1> yes he has the box in his hands for the rest of the video
<user1> he then closes his laptop which is on the floor .
<user1> i don 't know , i didn 't look closely
<user1> she picks up her bag and puts the stuff back into it .
<user1> just with the man still on the phone , and the man holding the bottle .
<user1> she keeps undressing after that
<user1> he pulls out his cell phone and looks at it .
<user1> i can see that so
<user1> no . it stays on the chair .
<user1> he turns the glass upside down and when it is empty , he puts it on the sink .
<user1> it look like a very nice living room
<user1> not sure if he put the shoes on or not as it never shows it .
<user1> he grabs something and throws it into a bucket
<user1> there is no speaking in the clip
<user1> she picks up the glass and drinks from it 2 times .
<user1> she looks in the mirror and fixes her hair .
<user1> she seemed , bored to me . just maybe normal , not happy or sad .
<user1> he entered in to room with a box
<user1> the vase shown is white
<user1> the man is looking at a cell phone . it is possible he is recording the woman .
<user1> no , he just has it in his hand .
<user1> no there is not any sound
<user1> he picks up a wooden box which is on the counter
<user1> yes . or at least sounds excited talking . uses words like " totes " .
<user1> i am fine . what do you want to know about the video ?
<user1> there is only one person in the video , a woman , throughout the entire thing .
<user1> that is the end . one man eating and paper gets thrown on the floor .

<user1> he is holding his shoes
<user1> no she doesn 't do any of that
<user1> yes at first she is working on her laptop .
<user1> no , it seems to be a quiet place
<user1> no , he doesn 't say anything .
<user1> just that the homework , and tidying by sweeping is the main gist of the video
<user1> he moves just a few steps .

<user1> the man just stands by the door .
<user1> oh yes he picks things up to put on a shelf , and in a box
<user1> no i think he is doing his chores
<user1> no , i really cannot see his face
<user1> i hear background noise and the two people speaking in another language .
<user1> he looks at the bottle and then takes a picture of it .
<user1> the sound of water running , a foreign language woman speaking , and a man sitting on a ' shut ' or ' closed ' toilet on his phone .

<user1> maybe mid 40 ' s but it is hard to tell .
<user1> he begins to remove his shirt but walks out of the room
<user1> the only thing she really does besides eating and looking at the photo is turning her head and looking out the window .
<user1> yes he goes all the way up and off to the left .
<user1> he appears to be white .
<user1> he looks about 40 to me . yes , it looks like he left the scene

<user1> she picks it up from the stairway .
<user1> it begins with a man sitting on a couch and watching tv

<user1> she put the purse down on the floor .
<user1> he just continues to look at the picture with his hand on the door knob and then he turns it over when the video ends
<user1> he bends over and picks up a bag and sneezes twice and then walks out .
<user1> no he doesn 't walk out of the room . he just opens the door to another room . the door blocks the camera so he readjusts the camera into the same room . that 's it .

<user1> no he never touches the bowl
<user1> he has on all black

<user1> one man is standing and one is seated for the duration of the video .
<user1> no , she is stirring a pot on the stove for the first half of video
<user1> yes he seems to be studing the paperwork and a little disgusted .
<user1> there is a man standing at the sink pouring a cup of water in the sink .
<user1> at the beginning of the video he has a piece of paper in his hand .
<user1> the man is seated when the video starts , yes .
<user1> hard to say again as it is far away .
<user1> he puts the sandwich down and walks down the hallway .
<user1> the other man is walking in circles looking at either a phone or a camera .
<user1> it does not show specifically what he is cleaning , i guess the toilet
<user1> he grabs what looks like a calender
<user1> he opens the closet door and take a book from the floor then toss it back into the closet .
<user1> the video is about 30 seconds .
<user1> no one else entered the house .
<user1> maybe moves a little fast .
<user1> i hear animals in the back like birds .
<user1> just the pot was on the stove .
<user1> yes she was engaged in this
<user1> they guy in the pink shirt leans up against the counter and the other guy turns around and is looking at a piece of paper .
<user1> no at the camera somewhere there

<user1> there is just one person
<user1> yes it is night . at the end of the video he turns out the light and it is completely dark .

<user1> yes he does cover face .
<user1> she is in a bathroom opening up a medicine cabinet .
<user1> the man is standing by the door and sneezes .
<user1> yes he does . after a short time passes while he is in the living room turning around circling slowly .
<user1> from the look of the sweater and longer hair it appears to be a female
<user1> i can 't tell what he is looking at
<user1> i do not think there is
<user1> yes it a broom there
<user1> no he just puts it in the cabinet .
<user1> he points to the cushion of a couch , and then coughs and talks to the other man .
<user1> he goes off video for a second and picks something , i guess from the fridge . then he returns next to the sink .
<user1> he reaches for the shoebox , but then stops and sneezes .
<user1> the woman is putting her shoes on .

<user1> yes , the other person is wearing glasses
<user1> yes , sitting on a chair in the doorway .
<user1> not sure maybe mid 30 ' s
<user1> no , he stays laying down the whole time .
<user1> the person in the video is a young woman
<user1> oddly , washing a bowl in the bathroom sink , and then leaves it in the water without rinsing .
<user1> i think that is the hoddie strings .
<user1> maybe soon he might be ready for a nap .
<user1> nope , and then the camera pans to the second guy who is standing by the window .
<user1> he sits down on the corner of the table with some papers on his lap . he also has a calculator that he 's punching number on .
<user1> yes , i do not have the ability to translate the language .

<user1> a man walks in carrying a phone and sits down in a chair in front of a computer .
<user1> yes , there is only one person
<user1> yes the man was speaking english but the woman did not say anything
<user1> she squats the whole time she vacuums .
<user1> i hear water flowing into the sink
<user1> it appears to be a laptop . after he sweeps he grabs a picture frame and places it on a desk he starts to organize .

<user1> no , the video ended with him lightly dusting after putting all the items back .
<user1> the boy is very short

<user1> no she does not drop anything she does throw a blanket on the floor .
<user1> yes man and a woman
<user1> yes he walks from stairs down
<user1> the room is quiet dirty and looks like it is in india
<user1> i dont see that in the video
<user1> sounds maybe male but hard to tell .
<user1> there is one man in the video ?
<user1> she smiles until she closes the laptop .
<user1> no words but i can hear the chair move and the sweeping noises
<user1> she just says " hello " and that is it .
<user1> it may be a living / dining area but i can 't really tell .
<user1> no , not at all . i think you can only see it when he goes to turn off the camera
<user1> none so far we noticed mostly pc game cartons and an mixture of disk top disks
<user1> from a small closet in the room .
<user1> one guy takes off his shirt and starts to hug a pillow and the other just walks around .
<user1> a man walks to the closet and starts going through stuff .
<user1> yes , he is alone . there is no one else .
<user1> no , she is the only person .
<user1> not really just that he fills water from the sink
<user1> no he doesn 't do anything but take his shoes off and eats from the plate
<user1> she places her boots together and sets them beside a box
<user1> i didn 't hear any sound
<user1> no the man with the laptop ignores the other man
<user1> i can see only one person in video
<user1> she is already in the bathroom when it starts .
<user1> at the end , she looks up at the camera and seems to be laughing at someone out of view .
<user1> if i had to guess , i would say they are around 18 .
<user1> she pulled dirty laundry out of a bag and put it in the machine .
<user1> it 's an orange color , then he removes his coat while drinking his coffee .
<user1> he does not speak a word .
<user1> she is giggling at someone on the phone . the dog barks at her . then she walks over to the dog and says achoo really loud . she laughs and walks away and the dog follows her
<user1> in one hand he has a screwdriver and the other a cell phone
<user1> he 's probably in his late 20s .
<user1> he has a laptop in his other hand .
<user1> yes he walks into the room and then he also walks out at the end .
<user1> its really easy just send short questions to me ... he picks it up , and walks and video ends seconds later
<user1> a man is standing with a laptop and a book in his hands .
<user1> she moves the door a little when grabbing the towel off the back .
<user1> no , there is nothing coming out of his mouth .
<user1> yes she is on the ground in the bathroom i believe
<user1> the door was already partially opened .
<user1> he looks like he is in a dorm dorm putting away his stuff and cleaning
<user1> he has a book bag that he takes a lap top out of and then dumps clothes out of it onto the bed .
<user1> yes , the girl does look somewhat bored .
<user1> no , he does not sit down
<user1> i can see only one person in the video
<user1> yes . that 's pretty much what goes on in the video .
<user1> it cuts off as he continues to play with the screwdriver .
<user1> his shoes are black in color .
<user1> yes she does just sit there
<user1> i think he is fluffing up an article of clothing .
<user1> where the video ends , squatting putting away his shoes
<user1> she does , after she catches the broom . she catches it picks up something then goes upstairs .
<user1> i think you are referring to the light switch .
<user1> the cat was staring and it went some where .
<user1> there is nobody else with him
<user1> he walks around and tries to do something .
<user1> it was dark so it was hard to tell what it was .
<user1> then she giggles , and walks off camera to turn the light off .
<user1> no , in this video they never leave the room
<user1> he laughs and then sets the broom down .
<user1> there are no windows , but i would guess maybe morning time .
<user1> he leaves the bathroom and turns off the light
<user1> no she is quiet and smiling
<user1> yes there is just one person .
<user1> he 's around 10 in age
<user1> yes that is everything in the video .
<user1> no she does not do much

<user1> no she took the glass with her
<user1> he puts the mug down on the table
<user1> she walks towards a light switch . turns it off and sighs or tries to laugh and walks back .

<user1> yes , there is just one person in the video .
<user1> she opens the fridge and sneezes
<user1> there are 2 people in the video .
<user1> a while plastic bag comes out when he sweeps under the bed
<user1> yes he does take a small sip from the coffee cup
<user1> he walks out of frame and has his back to the camera for most of the video so it is hard to tell what he was doing i am assuming cooking cause he was in a kitchen .
<user1> no i dont see any
<user1> the video moves to the bathroom .
<user1> there is only one person in the video
<user1> yes , there are two people in the video .
<user1> yes i just hear background noise .

<user1> then he puts the bag on the desk .

<user1> looks like a cell phone from what i can gather
<user1> she never talks in the video .
<user1> he opens a chest drawer and takes out a bed pillow .
<user1> it appears that they are cleaning a few things up in their bathroom and putting some items out on the counter .
<user1> he grabs a bed sheet on the floor .
<user1> a woman is sitting beside a dryer and reading a book .
<user1> he then clears the table of some papers .

<user1> she starts to sweep , and the she sneezes .
<user1> three steps in front of the cabinet .

<user1> no , she takes no clothes from the closet .

<user1> he looks to be about 12 .
<user1> no . she is silent the entire time .
<user1> yes , he is fluffing a pillow before putting it on a shelf in the closet .
<user1> the video runs for exactly thirty-one seconds .
<user1> i hear voices that i think are from a television .
<user1> this appears to be a bedroom .
<user1> there is nothing else in the video .
<user1> no , he picks up a camera .
<user1> no she did not do that but it look like she read a note attached to the blanket
<user1> i am not sure of her age .
<user1> when he gets into the bedroom he removes his hoodie .
<user1> he is just smiling in the video
<user1> the pillow was a light brown

<user1> she stands up and walks out of the scene and he stands up after he drops the cards on the floor .
<user1> no one leaves the room .
<user1> a young boy ran up the stairs with a pillow in his arm and an older gentleman walks down the stairs with a sandwich in his hand .
<user1> it looks like just one
<user1> he looks like he is 12 .
<user1> she looks like she is not comfortable . shes very overweight .
<user1> yes he is holding a laptop
<user1> a man cleaning the bathroom by picking up his clothes .
<user1> she laughs and drops her broom to grab and open her laptop .
<user1> no she was the only one
<user1> the video ends after that .
<user1> towards the end of the video , she is just standing there and appears to turn off the camera .
<user1> he has a book in his hand and finds a spot on the shelf for it
<user1> a living room i think , near a mirror
<user1> yes , he is in the video the entire time .
<user1> the last part you see if of him closing the pill bottle .

<user1> no , but she does look back at the camera a few times .
<user1> yes , just one man .
<user1> he walks up the stairs
<user1> yes he is in a closet
<user1> the camera does not show enough of the house to determine whether or not it 's messy .
<user1> he picks up a box looks in it and puts it on the shlf too like he is cleaning up the room
<user1> well she bends down and starts scratching her left foot while turning the door knob .
<user1> i would guess that she is in her low to mid 30s .
<user1> no they never leave at all
<user1> probably he is drinking a juice
<user1> yes he doe every last drop lol
<user1> i believe it is a man
<user1> she has long hair in a pony tail .

<user1> he walks into the room holding a tupperwear dish and then sets it down .
<user1> she puts the folded towel in the closet then the video ends .
<user1> drinks water from the bottle , when he gets up he grabs a broom ... then ...
<user1> noone is talking to the dog .
<user1> he does not say anything throughout the entire video .
<user1> i think someone off camera is doing something silly or funny .
<user1> no . she is the only one in the video .
<user1> yes that she does over and over again real fast .
<user1> perhaps it is a living room or hallway or foyer , hard to tell
<user1> she is wearing a pink hoodie
<user1> the end of the video is her shutting off the video .
<user1> i hear music and a rooster crowing and maybe birds .
<user1> no , i think we covered it all .
<user1> yes the video starts with her sitting
<user1> he puts it in the cabinet .
<user1> he is scraping another dish into the trash and smiles
<user1> fro the rest of the way half way out of the video
<user1> no it is silent no talking at all
<user1> yes , neither moves to a new location .
<user1> she takes off a sweat shirt
<user1> it is to the left of her out of sight
<user1> i would guess him to be in mid to late 20s .
<user1> something in a pan , could be a burger , maybe .
<user1> yes , that 's right it does .
<user1> in the beginning she just walked in
<user1> yes i say it is neat
<user1> the one man is holding a book and i can 't tell with the other .
<user1> where he dumped the drink was not visible , he was blocking it . only the audio sound of him dumping it and seeing his actions from back to , are indicators he dumped his drink .
<user1> i think he is insignificant . his cup has a clear liquid in it .
<user1> no one else is in the room .
<user1> the younger man passes the older man and leaves the area .
<user1> in an enclosed space as an dressing room
<user1> no , i think he was a bit lazy to get up because he seemed like he didnt want to but does
<user1> i can hear the crackling from whatever he is grabbing from the box .
<user1> the man seems to be pretty neutral .
<user1> no , i think it is a daily medication .
<user1> no . she just stands there holding the book and pillow until the end of the video .
<user1> no that is about it
<user1> just the sound of him laughing out loud .
<user1> he takes off his shoes and throws them under the desk .
<user1> the title isn 't apparent and the book itself is just black no cover art or anything .
<user1> he is squatting down at the beginning , but then he is standing for the rest of the video
<user1> yes he sits on sofa and snuggles with the blanket .
<user1> yes . it looks like he is cooking something
<user1> just the stairs and the lady
<user1> it looks like a dining room
<user1> he was trying to snap himself
<user1> the video ends with her grabbing the pillow
<user1> i believe it is a kitchen
<user1> yes it says classic american with another word underneath that i can 't make out
<user1> just one person is in the video
<user1> no we find him already sitting
<user1> i do not see any family pictures
<user1> she is simply looking out of the window .
<user1> he throws it angrily against the window .
<user1> yes she put it down after closing the top .
<user1> he goes into the kitchen and opens a cabinet over the stove and looks
<user1> he is cleaning up dishes and straightening books .
<user1> lets be fast yes there is one person when the video start
<user1> just one unless you include portrait frames
<user1> it looks like she is trying to put a lens on her camera
<user1> no he is quiet during the video .
<user1> there us a box on the floor
<user1> he sits there the whole time .
<user1> nothing else happens , but he is carrying a bag in one hand and shoes in the other the whole time
<user1> no the video is ended by that time
<user1> yes she seem to be a t home
<user1> oh , i forgot to mention sorry that he is sitting on something actually , it 's a pillow
<user1> she closes the door and leaves the room
<user1> backwards black hat and shorts
<user1> she takes a couple of steps and grabs her laptop .
<user1> he looks like he is in his early 20 ' s .
<user1> the older man is standing there holding a cup and saucer .
<user1> the woman is reading a book while lying down
<user1> it is batch room and he is sweeping floor
<user1> he seems to be emptying out a bag .
<user1> he was sitting there at the beginning .
<user1> he is just sitting in the chair still

<user1> no i don see any people inthe room
<user1> no i dont see anything else
<user1> a man goes into the bathroom and takes off his jacket
<user1> i can 't tell . maybe he is just taking it off and not changing .
<user1> he grabs the blanket and begins twirling it .
<user1> i dont hear any sound
<user1> he puts shoes in the dresser .
<user1> she throws a picture on the couch and opens a window .
<user1> yes i can 't tell if it 's a sock or an ankle wrap for an injury though , he 's wearing sandals also .
<user1> yes , i didn 't see anyone else .
<user1> he is probably 30-40 years of age .
<user1> he took another box from the shelf
<user1> she does use the vacuum for a very short time .
<user1> guy lifts up a camera , looks into the screen , snaps two quick photos , grabs doritos and banana smash and then leaves .
<user1> the mug is in his left hand and the spoon in the right .
<user1> just the can of chips she puts on the table .
<user1> he carries the vacuum out of the closet into a room but you can 't see what sort of room it is .
<user1> i dont hear anything in the video
<user1> i 'm not sure . she gets up and takes her boots with her and doesn 't come back .
<user1> it looks like a sandwich .
<user1> no , the woman does not say anything .
<user1> no , she appears to be okay .
<user1> yes there is white noise and something clanking in the background .
<user1> just one person in the video
<user1> the video ends before he finishes cleaning
<user1> it looks like a fitbit
<user1> he walks through the door , shuts the first outside door and then shuts the second door .
<user1> he has a camera in his hand that he keeps looking at .
<user1> no she did not speak
<user1> yes it appears so here
<user1> yes he has it the entire video
<user1> no , there is not any interaction between the two people .
<user1> a pot is on the stove .
<user1> yes , they look like flannel pajamas .
<user1> it 's a woman in the video .
<user1> yes she is already sitting when it starts .
<user1> no , that 's all he does after dropping the water bottle into the bucket .
<user1> i didn 't hear hi say anything
<user1> it 's probably sometime in the day .
<user1> i don 't think so . he seems ready to clean the table .
<user1> i can 't tell from this angle and there is no tv noise .
<user1> it looks like a kitchen to me
<user1> the dog is just sitting there looking .
<user1> he stands up and throws the socks on the couch and then the video ends .
<user1> i am not sure if he fixed it .

<user1> no there is no noise .
<user1> there is a slight sound when she sets the glass down .
<user1> no , there are no more people in the video other than the man and woman .
<user1> the woman was brushing her teeth .
<user1> no real audio outside of his chewing noises .
<user1> the room is kinda messy .
<user1> he is about to , then the video ends before he actually does it .
<user1> she takes out a beverage of some kind . i can 't tell what it is
<user1> no i cannot see what it is
<user1> she isn 't holding anything in her hand .
<user1> pretending to sleep while he 's on the bed .

<user1> it appears he is acting dramaticly
<user1> no , there is no one else in the room .
<user1> he kicks of his shoes in the first part then starts laughing

<user1> yes , he put down the pillow and stands up
<user1> i do not see any thing

<user1> i believe it 's a man .
<user1> yes it does begin with him standing .
<user1> the man is holding a sandwich .
<user1> he looks about 4o or so .
<user1> no , the video ends before he finishes it
<user1> she stays in the same spot the entire time .
<user1> a beige color i guess
<user1> thats about all that happened
<user1> the video is 37 seconds long .
<user1> no she sits up the whole time .
<user1> the man is washing dishes
<user1> it looks like a living area with stairs .
<user1> it looks to be chestnut brown .

<user1> he sits down and picks up a book and flips through it
<user1> there is just a female and a dog .
<user1> i 'm not great with ages . she is young . could be a teen or in her 20 ' s .
<user1> no he did not move at all .
<user1> probably men 's . if it 's a shirt , it is probably a button down shirt .
<user1> the room is quite messy looking , but it doesn 't necessarily look dirty .
<user1> i cannot see his face before he opens the cabinet .
<user1> they both stay in the same place-the one looking out the window , the other flipping through a book .
<user1> it appears to be a web page open on the laptop .
<user1> he sits at the table looking at the magazine with a hooded sweatshirt on and shorts picks up a broom and sprints towards the front door .
<user1> after playing with the knob he turns and walks into a kitchen , it looks like the door is just a few feet away from the kitchen .
<user1> yes , but i only hear the noises of him flipping pages .
<user1> she kind of stands there swaying her hips .
<user1> she picked up an empty box and walked back out into the hall
<user1> no , he did not do that .
<user1> no , she does not ever speak .
<user1> yes there are some lights on in the video .
<user1> i dont know but after he stops bouncing the ball he reaches down to a box at his feet .
<user1> he seems neutral the whole video .
<user1> the first man is at a little sink with a brush cleaning it .
<user1> nope , i do not hear nothing .
<user1> she just takes it out of the cabinet and holds it .
<user1> no , there is not anyone else in the room '
<user1> it looks like he could be .
<user1> the curtains are pulled but it appears to be daylight out .
<user1> yes he eats while standing there
<user1> i think he was eating some fruit , maybe an apple .
<user1> no , the girl in pink is just sort of laughs from time to time . however , they do not communicate with each other
<user1> the man enters from room to another . he grabs a chair and sits down . he 's holding a bucket and fishing pole . he smiles for the camera . video ends .
<user1> yes , she takes out a box of popcorn
<user1> a girl comes into frame , lays on the floor
<user1> no she does not do anything .
<user1> when she first walks through the doorway she put her purse on the door handle

<user1> no , she never leaves the room .
<user1> he does not leave the chair .

<user1> he does not get up from the bed .
<user1> he gets out of the chair
<user1> she appears to be about 18 .
<user1> no he does not leave the room .
<user1> no , but the girl who opens the fridge is holding a glass of water that she brought with her to the fridge , and she drinks it .
<user1> no , she did not return .
<user1> i can 't tell but i assume she 's following a recipe .
<user1> after she walks over to it , she just sits down
<user1> other than the conversation he is having with the person holding the camera , no .
<user1> he is off to one side of a small kitchen .
<user1> just clothes on hangers and some stuff on the top shelf
<user1> he is holding a book
<user1> he digs around in his backpack a bit
<user1> no , he was standing up the entire clip .
<user1> yes . it looks like he eats some rice
<user1> yes for a potion of the video i can see his face
<user1> nothing more to tell you .
<user1> not exactly but if i had to guess it would be daytime as it appears to be bright and sunny .
<user1> the man walks from the bed room to the kitchen .
<user1> correct , no one else is in the video .
<user1> no , i didn 't hear anything except the rustle of the bag when he zipped it shut .
<user1> yes he does open it
<user1> one person is seen in the video .
<user1> she is sitting on the couch holding a cup looking out the window .
<user1> nothing else of interest other than he uses a broom to close the dresser door
<user1> yes he is sitting alone .
<user1> no , i can only see the one man .
<user1> he is talking to someone you can 't see for part of the video
<user1> he is looking at his phone

<user1> yes , she 's is chuckling in the video .
<user1> no she never looks at the camera

<user1> just one person is here
<user1> he holds a cell phone .
<user1> two . the man in the video and someone else holding the camera .

<user1> no noise that i heard of .
<user1> no , but he watches tv .
<user1> no , it doesn 't appear to .
<user1> no she doesn 't talk to the camera but she looks into the camera a lot . and after she puts the blanket on , she smiles into the camera .
<user1> it ends with the person continuing to clean the door and the man watching him on the bed
<user1> she put the shoes to the left of her and the box in front of her i believe both on the floor
<user1> he points the camera at the mirror and pretends to take a picture .
<user1> the walls are painted white .
<user1> just the one man with long hair
<user1> the light appears to be on .
<user1> he was looking away from the camera .
<user1> he smiles and looks down at the book .
<user1> no , it is only the one man .
<user1> not really , he stays in pretty much the same place

<user1> he is probably about 20 years of age and there is no background noise at all . he did not leave the door .
<user1> there are no pets in the video
<user1> yes he did because the cabinet was closed
<user1> she then sits back down on the floor and i can 't see if she does or not
<user1> she seems to be comfortable there , so i would say she lives there .
<user1> you see her better when she is putting the bulb in the fridge then her back mostly while cooking
<user1> she is already in there
<user1> yes the guy is cleaning
<user1> there is one man in the room the entire time .

<user1> yes that is correct . its only one man in the room .
<user1> he holds it out with his arm extended . no swinging

<user1> at first he is holding a comb and combing his hair
<user1> yes he does do that
<user1> there is the sound of a sneeze .
<user1> the man is just looking inside of an empty fridge
<user1> he appears to clean it because he stopped as soon as he cleaned the area with a sponge .
<user1> there is one man in video
<user1> he stands there texting most of the time and then throws his phone towards the couch .
<user1> he runs down the stairs out of sight and she keeps fiddling with her hair in front of the mirror
<user1> only the box and the jacket he puts into it

<user1> i don 't see that there 's a television anywhere in the room .
<user1> i don 't know what it is
<user1> yes , they have a conversation but its not clear what they are saying .
<user1> there was nothing else interacting but before she drops the towel on the floor she stretches for a while .
<user1> he seems content , just in a mediocre concetration
<user1> they seem to be in their teens
<user1> he walks off the camera
<user1> he walks down the stairs at the beginning .

<user1> there is a man sitting on a chair watching something on a laptop

<user1> yes there is a person in the video .
<user1> no , i do not see anyone else in the video .
<user1> no , there is no sound coming from the laptop .
<user1> i believe based on my observation of the hands , most likely a male

<user1> no he just stands in front of the laptop . doesn 't lay down at all .
<user1> the man is doing homework in the light .
<user1> no , really she tidies up on a dresser that is by the sink where her coffee sits and that is it .

<user1> no he wasn 't talking but he has facial expression as he was about to talk at the end of the video .

<user1> no not much mostly ambeint
<user1> no , they just keep hanging there .

<user1> yes , you can hear him moving and a television in the background .
<user1> she enters it when the viseo starts .
<user1> he enters the room from a hallway
<user1> yes i can hear it , but i cannot tell what it is or what is being said

<user1> one man is folding the blanket and the other keeping it in wardrobe .
<user1> it 's one woman talking about marriage and walking down the isle .
<user1> yes they never move from in front of the hall closet
<user1> it looks like something that cuts a vegetable or a fruit .
<user1> he closes a door , which he opened and slides a chair up to the table .
<user1> no she never looks at it . she just stares off .
<user1> just some background noise in the video .
<user1> there is just one younger lady in the video .
<user1> nothing else i did not already say
<user1> all you can hear is him running
<user1> he 's holding a spatula in his hand
<user1> after he pours the water in the sink the other man in the pink shirt throws a towel in the sink from across the room .
<user1> no the only sounds are the items he is in contact with
<user1> the walls are white in color
<user1> looks like a bottle of ketchup
<user1> the dog jumps up into the chair and looks out the window .
<user1> he is in the dining room of a house .
<user1> she picks up her shoes and acts like she is pouring the stuff from the box over her shoes
<user1> he is standing near a cabinet
<user1> no there is no background music ?
<user1> there are two , if you count the dog as a person .
<user1> he took a book in his hands
<user1> i dont hear any noise in the video .
<user1> yes it looks like in the closet the light is on
<user1> they just fixed a light
<user1> no , he didn 't go back to the mirror .
<user1> it 's hard to tell . maybe a living room .
<user1> yes he took first a drink then held the can in one hand and grabbed a book with the other hand
<user1> no , the dog wags his tail and climbs a step to look at her but then leaves when she ignores him .
<user1> she does not say anything .
<user1> no real sweeping , juts seems to position it against the stairway wall .
<user1> no he is not on a phone he is talking to someone else in the background
<user1> he looked tired and he was having a hard time maybe peeling the fruit .
<user1> no , he doesn 't seem rushed at all . sweeping at a normal pace .
<user1> no , she does not have shoes on .
<user1> no i can not see what is in the bag .
<user1> the second man is just watching him .
<user1> she struggles a bit to get up then walks out of view
<user1> yes , that is the end .
<user1> he is white , i think , he has something on his head .
<user1> the girl in orange girl looks like she 's wearing some kind of grey pants . probably not jeans .
<user1> a man walks into a bathroom
<user1> no , he stays in the kitchen .
<user1> the video is 30 seconds long
<user1> the person is a boy .
<user1> i think it is a bathroom .
<user1> possibly a kitchen it looks like
<user1> he sits down in the chair , moves a vase out of the way and then puts the laptop on the table
<user1> no , i don 't hear him speak .
<user1> no that 's all that happened in the video .
<user1> he grabs a spice and puts it on the food he is cooking
<user1> yes , it appears to be a kitchen or dining area .
<user1> yes he is there the whole time .
<user1> no , they just stand there talking .
<user1> yes , she is smiling and taking the selfies as the video ends .
<user1> again his back is turned , even while he 's at the table napping
<user1> he picks up the soda bottle and pours soda into a glass .
<user1> there was a lady showing off her camera .
<user1> the object is small enough in a large video frame that you cannot discern the phone type .
<user1> no she does not eat anything in the videp
<user1> he must because he could leave .
<user1> he opens the laptop and goes on it .
<user1> no only the man running down the stairs is seen .
<user1> a shirt and pants , no shoes or socks
<user1> he is holding and carrying a box
<user1> she crosses them at towards the end of the video .
<user1> no , she just continues to stand in the hallway with the phone to her ear .
<user1> you can see him moving as if to keep warm and drinking the whole movie .
<user1> no you can not hear him reading . he is just flipping the pages and smiling at the book .
<user1> no , not enough time in video to know if he does that
<user1> there is just one female .
<user1> he sets the broom down in the pantry but does not take anything out of it .
<user1> he just has it in his hand .
<user1> i really can 't tell if he is .
<user1> sounds like an crowd of bangle-dish men
<user1> it looks like a front room with 2 computers on a table and a front door open .
<user1> he puts a bag on a shelf walks out takes a jacket off turns around and places the jacket on a shelf in the closet
<user1> after the window , he walks over to a picture , looks at it and laughs . that is the end .
<user1> i believe it is some sort of yogurt .
<user1> no he only uses a broom .
<user1> no , i just hear him laughing
<user1> i can 't tell because she is indoors .
<user1> he sneezes into his hand
<user1> i do not know that
<user1> she does not go into the room . the video starts with her in the hallway , and then she turns and walks towards the camera and out of the range of view .
<user1> no - there 's just background noise with no talking or significant audio .
<user1> nhe does not have a camera
<user1> looks like a basement or a garage .
<user1> yes he is leaving the room disgusted .
<user1> no he continues to stir until the end
<user1> she comes in to brush her teeth .
<user1> probably not . he is just having some fun .
<user1> no , i think you have a good understanding .
<user1> he is already there in the room .
<user1> no they are in the whole video
<user1> just the sneezing is all .
<user1> he is drinking from a cup and then he looks into a box
<user1> it is a man , i can 't see the person operating the camera though .
<user1> the man walks in with a plastic bag and puts it down .
<user1> she makes a worried sound like deep breath
<user1> there are no pets in the room .
<user1> there is only one person
<user1> he is sitting the entire time
<user1> no , she is the only person in the video . she was just eating the sandwich .
<user1> no , it 's just the 2 people .
<user1> there is no carpet on the floor .
<user1> it seems like she is standing in a study .
<user1> a woman walks into a hallway in what i assume to be her house and walks to the closet .
<user1> yes they are doing that
<user1> it appears to be day time .
<user1> he does not appear happy or sad - just indifferent .
<user1> no . nothing is heard in the video .
<user1> no some noises but no voice
<user1> another boy comes into the shot
<user1> no . he was just cutting something in half .
<user1> there is no sound in the video .
<user1> yes i believe it is day time .
<user1> she stands then sits then stands again
<user1> and she is wiping her feet on the rug ... the whole time
<user1> it looks like tea but she pours it in her food
<user1> it takes about thirty seconds
<user1> the older man is just laying on the floor .
<user1> he is straightening a photo on the wall
<user1> he picks up the shoebox .
<user1> no i dont see any carpet there
<user1> no , she is more neutral .
<user1> am not show what it was .
<user1> no but takes several sips
<user1> it looks like she may be , but she is a bit ackward
<user1> i can 't see a large garage door . have a great evening !
<user1> there is a little , nothing vocalized though .
<user1> he takes a knapsack from a shelf when he 's mid-way up the steps , and he runs upstairs with it .
<user1> yes , he has no socks on .
<user1> not that you can see , but i suspect there is someone holding the camera .
<user1> i would guess it 's some type of washer .
<user1> the person removes the blanket from around his shoulders , gets up from the table , , walks over to a window , looks out , then walks out of frame
<user1> 25 maybe . as he is dressing like a young person .
<user1> no one else appears in the video .
<user1> hes inside a room so i dont know
<user1> just one person in the video
<user1> i think he is in living room
<user1> it look like some groceries .
<user1> she is in a laundry room
<user1> looks like a bucket or basket i think
<user1> he does wash his hands
<user1> no he only washes the feruit he takes out of the fridge .
<user1> she puts the pot away .
<user1> she says , " hey , what 's up "
<user1> there are two , both males .
<user1> yes , he seems relaxed in the video .
<user1> yes , the plates remain in his left hand .
<user1> he uses the mop on the stairs .
<user1> there are no pets in the vidoe
<user1> he comes out of the bathroom into what appears to be a bedroom .
<user1> yes she grabs some items which include books and put them in a bag around her arm .
<user1> yes , after he gets the snack out he sits down on a chair and reads the bag label .
<user1> she is talking on the phone while walking
<user1> strangely , yes she does . she sticks her head down in the sink and takes a drink .
<user1> a man , he is alone in the kitchen .
<user1> yes just the one man in the video .
<user1> the man who starts out sitting never gets up .
<user1> no , she is alone throughout the video
<user1> the man appears to be in his late 20s or early 30s .
<user1> no the dog didnt bark at all
<user1> yes , there is one man .
<user1> yes , there was a brief word spoken .
<user1> no she does not , she stands on the wall the whole video
<user1> she doesn 't say anything in the video . there is a tv in the background making noise though .
<user1> yes after he sits down and kicks them off .
<user1> it 's just the girl she walks in and does what i said then slowly walks into a laundry room
<user1> no , there are no pets .
<user1> the man is standing in the kitchen looking out a window .
<user1> yes , he ties each shoe .
<user1> i 'm not sure maybe a piece of cake

<user1> there are two people in this video .
<user1> nothing like that in this video . not much sound .
<user1> he does not drink anything .
<user1> no he laughs a little bit at his book .
<user1> no i can 't see what the brand logo .
<user1> he stay seated the whole time .
<user1> it 's odd he stands in front of the refridgerator and acts like he is trying to open the door or wants to open the door and never does .
<user1> it looks like steaks but it is hard to see what is in the pan
<user1> no he is sitting at a disc then walked to a table and sits there to eat a bite
<user1> my best guess would be a living room .
<user1> no , she sets it down on the washing machine .
<user1> just background sounds . like walking
<user1> no she stays in the same area .
<user1> i cannot see what he is sitting on .
<user1> i dont think so in the video
<user1> no she doesn 't drink anything .
<user1> yes , and the video ends as she finishes adjusting it .
<user1> he looks to be in a hallway .
<user1> yes he is eating something . a sandwich perhaps .
<user1> after closing the cabinet he left the room
<user1> i can see one man in the video
<user1> it is in a bedroom .
<user1> yes he enters very quickly
<user1> he starts to wipe down the cabinet door .

<user1> he starts walking down then he sits down and then he proceed to lay down
<user1> just he was sitting on bed and watching light and smiling then went to window
<user1> he stays in the video the whole time .
<user1> looks like a movie or a show .
<user1> she has a picture in her hand and she throws it onto the bed
<user1> he seems to be trying to fix the base of one of the bannister spikes that attaches to the stairs .
<user1> she has one hand stretched out reaching into closet and she grabs a towel from the sink with the other hand
<user1> not much blur to it alot of moving camera work .
<user1> she has a neutral expression .
<user1> there are no windows in the room
<user1> no , there are no animals at all .
<user1> it 's about 20 seconds long
<user1> yes the video starts with him sitting on the chair , and then the bite
<user1> yes , another girl is in the video with black hair
<user1> no she was there the whole time
<user1> no he doesn 't have a cell phone

<user1> i cannot say for sure but it looks sort of clear .
<user1> he only looks at the computer screen
<user1> the man is looking at the camera and picks up a phone handset
<user1> yes , she is there in the beginning
<user1> yes then he grabs the camera and ends

<user1> the bag was already on the stairs
<user1> that is all that i see
<user1> it looks cluttered but clean .
<user1> there is no verbal communication between them .
<user1> they are inside of the house
<user1> yeah , he looks like he is waiting for something
<user1> they where already on the counter
<user1> when he is looking in the closet there are some voices , i thought it was the tv but when he laughs somoene else laughs also .
<user1> hard to say i would estimate early 40 ' s .
<user1> yes with the blanket folded on his lap
<user1> i did not notice a label of anything
<user1> no he did not do anything else
<user1> no i dont see anyone in the video
<user1> no she is only holding the phone not talking on it .

<user1> she is sitting on the couch reading a book
<user1> no he just stands there and talks but i don 't hear speech

<user1> its a plastic container from what i saw .
<user1> te woman is standing at the end of a hall and the man is running back and forth .
<user1> ends with her at the cabinet
<user1> he stands in one spot while he buttons his shirt then he moves .
<user1> she walked away in room
<user1> there is one small box beside him on the steps .
<user1> i am not sure what kind of medicine it is . he at the very end of the video , opens up the bottle and looks inside of it .
<user1> he may be around 40 .
<user1> the guy is wearing black pans and a blanket .
<user1> yes off of the blue chair
<user1> i think maybe she poured something in the glass
<user1> yes it 's in one room

<user1> yes , there is talking , but i can 't make it out .
<user1> no eating or drinking in this video
<user1> that is it she is just straightening them out .
<user1> i think empty can of soda and trash it look like she is clean up after ameal
<user1> one man is washing a mirror .
<user1> it looks like a warehouse , garage or a small storage space .
<user1> on , he took the frame and close the door behind him .
<user1> it is supposed to be a home office .
<user1> the first thing he does after coming in is take his shoes off

<user1> actually i can see the knobs on it to turnoff and on .
<user1> cant guess is inside house
<user1> they look like a young male

<user1> he is likely in his late 20 ' s or early 30 ' s

<user1> it begins with her just standing in front of a cupboard .
<user1> yes , he throws it in there .
<user1> he doesn 't go into the room that he 's touching the knob for , he just plays with the knob for a while .
<user1> there is audio , i can hear music and background noise .

<user1> at the end she runs to the left
<user1> she tosses the pillow on the ground .

<user1> then he walk s out of the room .
<user1> no , she spends most of her time looking in her closet .
<user1> i can hear the door opening and closing on the audio .
<user1> like a patisserie of some sort . not a donut but maybe a danish .
<user1> he throws them in to the closet
<user1> no but the person laughs throughout
<user1> it was on the counter in a kitchen
<user1> it looks like a bedroom or small living room .

<user1> just a person talking in the back ground .

<user1> he dawdles before climbing over to the table
<user1> the items get stirred and flipped

<user1> she was in the room at the start of the video already . in front of the couch like you said .
<user1> one shoe landed in the corner of the door that he closed and the other landed on a mat next to the door .
<user1> that 's all she does , she just kind of shifts around while drinking
<user1> no she just runs through .
<user1> no , they are quite serious .
<user1> she puts the two packs on the counter and goes real fast to pick up a paper towel from counter closer to the camera
<user1> i would guess that is the correct age .

<user1> college age i would guess .
<user1> she is putting some food
<user1> she picks up a pillow and opens the closet .

<user1> there is some audio . mostly , background noise .
<user1> i can only see one man in the video
<user1> he is wearing jeans and a darker colored sweatshirt .
<user1> yes he finds a spot to place it
<user1> yes that is pretty much the whole video
<user1> the video ends rather quickly with her sitting there and sneezing , not long at all .
<user1> he didn 't spray anything , at the end he sits on a chair .
<user1> no there is no talking .
<user1> yes there is audio in the video .
<user1> she is laughing a lot
<user1> yes he eats the sandwich
<user1> yes , she leaves the room halfway through the video
<user1> it looks like he is fumbling with something , but his back is towards the camera
<user1> the only noise that i hear is when the guy is drinking the bottled water . he is squeezing it a bit .
<user1> i think so . there is food being cooked and music being played .
<user1> she opens her magazine and read it .
<user1> i would say in his 60s .
<user1> no i don 't see him take anything else out .
<user1> no , she never makes any food
<user1> she had it on floor and is sitting crossed legged . she pulls it onto her lap and shows it to the camera ..
<user1> she giggles a little at the end
<user1> no their are no sneezes just a laugh after he takes the medicine
<user1> he accidentally drops water on clothes .
<user1> it appears to be in a garage , yes .
<user1> somewhere from the middle east if i had to guess .
<user1> no , he does not drink the glass of water .
<user1> not particularly but maybe a bit annoyed
<user1> the water does not seem to be running .
<user1> no , there isn 't any sound .
<user1> no , the room is clean
<user1> yes you can hear the tv turn on but not much sound is coming out , so i could not make out much of it .
<user1> i think it 's a bedroom .
<user1> he just shifts a little bit .
<user1> no , she just stands around
<user1> no he doesnt take anything
<user1> yes . the man sits the entire video once he enters the room .
<user1> he just looks at the book and the grabs a sandwhich from a plate on the desk .
<user1> yes he is alone in the video it appears
<user1> no , he is putting the book away .
<user1> i think about 11 or 12 . he doesn 't look old enough to be a teenager .
<user1> that was all that happened
<user1> no , he stays in the video .
<user1> no , he starts the video with one shirt and the video ends with him wearing a different shirt
<user1> i would assume he does .
<user1> i would say in her twenties
<user1> some guy is in the dark looking at a medicine bottle .
<user1> no i can 't tell what he 's getting
<user1> no he just goes over to look
<user1> no , it doesn 't change at all .
<user1> it is hard to tell because there are no windows .
<user1> the man is looking at himself in the mirror .
<user1> no , the vacuum is next to her at the end
<user1> the video ends by her opening the door and walking out .
<user1> yes he is at the start already in that room
<user1> no , he only walk down the stairs on his way out .
<user1> he is standing up straight and turns off a switch that is on the wall .
<user1> she walks out of view ( probably going to go check her phone )
<user1> no . i wouldn 't say that . he is just doing some chores it appears .
<user1> the man is drinking water
<user1> no . i didn 't see him smiling at all .
<user1> that is where the video ends ( with him sitting on a chair and reading it ) .
<user1> that 's all that happens in this video .
<user1> the boy remains working on the task until the end when he takes a drink .
<user1> no , that is all that happened .
<user1> there is only one person in this video .
<user1> it looks clean enough there
<user1> no , it appears he was already there .
<user1> north american or european .. some kind of nonrussian white
<user1> the first thing is the man sitting down .
<user1> there is only one young lady in the whole video .
<user1> he might be about twelve or thirteen years old .
<user1> yes the man does open the box .
<user1> ok the kid did sit up for a bit . and the woman seems to be saying his name then he lays down . the she says let me get a close up
<user1> no , at the end he was facing the camera .
<user1> no i think he is faking .
<user1> no he does not grab anything . he basically gets up from sitting on the bed and walks across the room and sits down
<user1> in her twenties most likely
<user1> he jut moves them tidies them up
<user1> just 1 person in the video .
<user1> he lowers it a little after drinking but keeps it up in front of his face .
<user1> yes there is sound , sound when she is stirring sounds like the pan is empty
<user1> he did not wash dishes .
<user1> yes , he eats grapes as he is putting the other items away in the pantry .
<user1> yes the camera is stationary .
<user1> no , there is no sound .

<user1> to me it looks like a gift bag but the description states groceries .
<user1> she is taking off her hoodie .
<user1> yes after his dance he picks
<user1> his expression appears to be netural
<user1> she stands on the chair
<user1> she seems very bored inthis video
<user1> i can hear a baby crying in the background .
<user1> about half of the video
<user1> no there is nothing important

<user1> he sits up but stays on the couch .
<user1> there are no kids in the video

<user1> it 's probably his study room .
<user1> just one man in the video .
<user1> i can 't really see through what in the bag , but i guess is a 2 liter type of soda bottle .
<user1> there is a sun coming from outside , it must be morning or afternoon

<user1> it is thirteenish seconds in length .
<user1> someone else in the room is talking in a non english language , and the video ends as he is eating .
<user1> he dances at the beginning
<user1> there is a tea kettle on the stove
<user1> it is out of camera view . it does sound like maybe he sets his coffee down on a hard surface .
<user1> not exactly , she does more action with the medication .
<user1> some storage containers , garbage can and big bag that appears to be either thick canvas or woven plastic
<user1> the woman opens the window at the end and can see her patio .
<user1> it looks like it 's daytime
<user1> not really , more like late 30 ' s .
<user1> yes he took his phone out at the end of the video clip
<user1> in-between sneezes and biting some food . to be odd sort of manner
<user1> maybe they are just laughing at the camera no one else
<user1> yes , both people are in the room
<user1> no he just stands in the same spot .
<user1> no , just him making noise with a plate or bowl .
<user1> it looks like a bedroom
<user1> the video ends so i don 't know .
<user1> just the girl laughing at the end
<user1> the man enters about half way through , gets aspirin and leaves the scene before the end .
<user1> no , there is one person dressing in front of a laptop while the other is holding a camera up towards him .
<user1> there is only one person here
<user1> they look like they are both white
<user1> i think she is in kitchen
<user1> she stands looking at the book most of the time then turns to leave room .
<user1> she does not eat in the video
<user1> it looks to be a living / dining room combo
<user1> it appears to be cereal .
<user1> he moves very slowly on clip
<user1> the stairs are spiral yes .
<user1> he comes down with it and the video ends there . it 's a very short clip .
<user1> no . he looks pretty disappointed at the size of the tv .
<user1> the man enters the room
<user1> no , there is no background noise really .
<user1> looks like clothes and linens .
<user1> it 's hard to tell , but probably in his 30s .
<user1> he turns the light on and off a couple of times
<user1> yes he is alone , by himself
<user1> no change at all in her demeanor .
<user1> yes . the man is holding a remote .
<user1> looks like some kind of bread or dough from what i can see
<user1> i do hear some muffled noise in the background but can 't make out what it is . the guy standing also sneezes in the video and i hear that .
<user1> he just sets it down and puts his head back as if relaxing .
<user1> no he is not smelling anything .
<user1> a man is drinking coffee
<user1> i think you know everything .
<user1> he continues to hold the book in his hand after picking it up .

<user1> the screen is too dark to tell
<user1> she turns around and looks at the couch .
<user1> i hear some noises but nothing i can make out .
<user1> no i can not tell if it is on .
<user1> he smiles before answering the phone , then he looks at the phone like he 's surprised , and then he throws the box on the floor .
<user1> only one chair is present
<user1> he is just eating the food
<user1> he cleans a box for awhile and then moves stuff on that desk .
<user1> yes , that 's pretty much all he is doing .
<user1> she looks very sad while she walks down the hallway .
<user1> he just got his blanket and sleep
<user1> yes , he then takes a hoodie out puts it on and zips it up
<user1> he tosses it behind him
<user1> while i can 't see for sure whether it 's on , the way she looks at it , i 'm assuming she is watching something on the screen .
<user1> she is hanging a picture .
<user1> no , no one sits down
<user1> yes , static and the sound of picking things up and arranging things
<user1> after she has the laptop and camera in her hands she sits on something and that really was the whole clip .
<user1> one is boredom the other is mere monotone standing gin the shade
<user1> he does not wear a wedding ring
<user1> he is younger , probably 20s .
<user1> there are 2 people in the video
<user1> he sets the remote on the bed and picks up a box for a camera or phone ...
<user1> it is hard to tell if they are carrying anything when they came back into the room .
<user1> no , he 's leaving the frame when it ends .
<user1> either 40 ' s or 50 ' s its hard to tell
<user1> sounds like there might be a fan
<user1> no , i cannot see anything out the window . all i see is blue out of the window . it may be raining .
<user1> she 's staring at the laptop screen .
<user1> she walks the basket into the kitchen , walks back towards the table , then takes off running into the kitchen .

<user1> he just holds them the whole time and never sets them down .
<user1> i think he is speaking english
<user1> the room is dark . it may be a clear plastic cup or glass .
