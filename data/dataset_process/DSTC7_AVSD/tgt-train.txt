<user1> it looks like daytime in the video .
<user1> the dog looks white and brown

<user1> he closes the door behind him .
<user1> one male speaks to the other .
<user1> not really , but it is a decent size cat
<user1> he takes his hands out of his pockets and opens a drawer .
<user1> it sounded like a carrot when she bit off a piece .
<user1> the room was off white
<user1> the scarf looks white to me .
<user1> at first she is holding the box then she places it on the shelf .
<user1> you only see him , but he is speaking to the cameraman
<user1> the photographer is in the room making the video .

<user1> she folds the box closed and tosses it
<user1> he says the word " okay . "

<user1> no actually i said it wrong he is removing the shoes
<user1> he is sitting in a chair
<user1> no , he holds on to it the whole time .
<user1> no , he always catches the pillow

<user1> she takes a book off the shelf , opens it , reads the pages , and laughs .
<user1> he looks confused about the instructions
<user1> he is looking at it but not typing .

<user1> there is a rustling sound , no speech
<user1> running down the stairs from upstairs .
<user1> no , he is alone here .
<user1> he walks into another room that may be the dining or living room
<user1> the younger man is staring at the monitor for the entire duration of the video .

<user1> no he doesn 't do any
<user1> no he was on the steps the whole time

<user1> he does not leave the room .
<user1> she walks through a hallway , then stops by a short table .
<user1> no , he points down at a pair of shoes on the ground and is amused by it .
<user1> it looks like a lower-level room , such as a basement .
<user1> she is folding laundry in the hall .
<user1> no , it doesn 't show that
<user1> it was on the floor .
<user1> i would guess he is probably late thirties or early forties .
<user1> only one person in this clip
<user1> yes , she was the only person in video
<user1> yes , it is just him
<user1> no it is just the one man .
<user1> no she only closes it .

<user1> he then proceeds to the fridge and opens it
<user1> yes , she takes her sweater off after the boots .
<user1> she reaches back into the bag .

<user1> at the very end of the video , he opens up a closet door to his left .
<user1> the video begins with him sleeping and lasts a few seconds before he awakens .
<user1> he seems to be late 20s , maybe 30s
<user1> no there is 1 child laying at he foot of the stairs but not asleep
<user1> he keeps it in hid hand
<user1> i 'm not sure what his mood is . he 's fairly calm and matter-of-fact .

<user1> seems to be in a neutral kind of mood .
<user1> no , he is not using the remote . the movie was already on .
<user1> no , he only glances at it for a second .
<user1> looks like a sandwich of some kind
<user1> it ends with the wrapped up one sneezing over and over again .
<user1> yes that correct in the video
<user1> no , there is nothing else worth noting
<user1> she is loading it with shoes
<user1> no not at all , neither one .
<user1> probably not since it was there while he presumably slept .
<user1> no you dont need anything else
<user1> maybe he likes to hold soft things . maybe he is a quick typer and likes to multitask with his comforting pillow . or maybe he just likes to hold things .
<user1> yes , he picked up a glass of water .
<user1> he looks like he 's late 20s

<user1> no , always from the back .
<user1> i don 't know i never see his face so it 's hard to tell
<user1> she is standing on a step holding a plate with a cup on it .
<user1> it may be a science experiment or some sort of homework .
<user1> the man is probably around 30 years old .
<user1> no that was about all that happened .
<user1> no other people visible but you can hear someone talking in the background .
<user1> he doesn 't look insane , he looked at the camera .
<user1> no it is a shot inbetween the two
<user1> the two peoplelook at one another .
<user1> i think she might but i don 't think it was on purpose . it 's not part of the video
<user1> i would guess early morning , around 7 - ish
<user1> just a few . they are in a small red bag .
<user1> no , she just sits up , grabs the towel and sort of lays back down while hugging or snuggling the towel .
<user1> no he doe not speak at all .

<user1> he is sitting on the floor and i think working on homework .
<user1> probably early to mid 20 ' s
<user1> he 's standing up with his laptop in his hand .
<user1> it looks like he is in a garage
<user1> he went out of the scene and then at the end you can see him cutting the camera off .
<user1> there seems to be someone else in the room , but we do not see them .
<user1> just the water running when she turns it on .
<user1> no i can 't really hear anything
<user1> no that is all that we see
<user1> i believe he is looking for something , but his back is to the camera most of the time .

<user1> no that was it in the video .
<user1> yes , she uses a towel .

<user1> he is alone in the kitchen .
<user1> no he does not drink the coffee just holds it
<user1> no he does not turn the volume down .
<user1> no its just him the whole time .
<user1> he grabs the vacuum cleaner after he stands back up .
<user1> he used his phone /
<user1> well he puts the phone back in his pocket and the video ends and he still has a little piece of the sandwich in his hand
<user1> to be honest nothing really happens throughout the video .
<user1> he was standing the holding some food item and camera
<user1> no , i don 't hear anything in the video .

<user1> no some part of kitchen they shown in video
<user1> yes he has dark brown hair .
<user1> the man appears to be in his 40s or early 50s .
<user1> it looks like he is reading , but he holds out his mug and the other guy pours some beverage or water into it .
<user1> throws it over his shoulder .
<user1> no the lights stayed on the entire time .
<user1> i dont think so . , not really
<user1> he opens the refrigerator door then bends down .
<user1> it looks like it is daytime but it is not clear
<user1> no , he has a light and a bottle of medicine
<user1> yeah hes the only one there .
<user1> i am not sure of the dog 's breed as i am not familiar with such things .
<user1> he 's standing still by the door , watching her laugh , and smiling .
<user1> he took a bit , started chewing , and then turned forty-five degrees to his left .
<user1> i can 't see their feet
<user1> he has a pillow and puts it between his legs .
<user1> there is just one middle aged man .
<user1> he is laughing about something , drinking and then looking at something
<user1> no , she does not open the refrigerator .
<user1> he picks up a plastic bag from the floor and holds it up in his arms ( at his chest ) .
<user1> no , just one of the men .
<user1> he started stretching his arms .
<user1> i dont hear any thing
<user1> i already told you all that happens
<user1> it didn 't look like she was making any faces or anything .
<user1> nothing he did before that
<user1> it seems that way because he seems to be responding to her .
<user1> they are in a kitchen
<user1> nothing else of importance happens
<user1> i see daylight through the window in the bedroom .
<user1> yes . i can the boy sneeze .
<user1> yes , he 's reading a small book .
<user1> no he doesn 't do anything else
<user1> the boy wipes his nose with the back of his hand after sneezing .
<user1> it might be a living room , the decor is very sparse , so i 'm not sure .
<user1> yes , no one else comes into the video .
<user1> no i do not see anyone else
<user1> i don 't see any natural light , so i 'm thinking it is night .
<user1> i do not know . i would say preference .
<user1> she just runs in there with a blanket and the phone
<user1> no , i think she is only watching a movie
<user1> well i dont think i can guess that
<user1> he is inside of a kitchen .
<user1> once she puts the shoes on , she sits at the desk and sneezes before getting up .
<user1> no they do not leave the room
<user1> there is only one man .
<user1> the girl sits up from laying down and the older woman looks at her
<user1> no , it 's very hard to tell .
<user1> no the video ends with her still in the pantry
<user1> not at all just the person jumping about
<user1> he makes some noise , but it could be a sensative mic .
<user1> no , i can 't get that detail .
<user1> no , but he stares at his phone .
<user1> he puts various objects on the floor into the box next to them
<user1> seems to be a man in the video .

<user1> it 's hard to tell , but i believe that it is a tablet computer and a pair of headphones .
<user1> the lighting is fine and the video is clear and easy to see .
<user1> you can hear a womans voice in the beginning but she is probably just the one recording

<user1> it is a white fridge .

<user1> no he just resumes walking up stairs
<user1> yes the kid is sitting on the floor

<user1> she takes a few sips from a cup she 's holding .
<user1> it looks like water or a clear drink .

<user1> i can 't really tell . maybe another cup and a book or something
<user1> no she keeps her head down all you hear is her sniffing
<user1> they stay right there at the mirror .

<user1> young in his 20s maybe 25
<user1> no there is no audio in the video

<user1> it is hard to make out but sounds like " you are all mine "
<user1> not at the beginning of the video .
<user1> yes , he places food into a pan .

<user1> the person seems to be a teenage girl .
<user1> the description says bag of groceries but it 's a backpack full of junk .
<user1> n , he never looks at it only the photo
<user1> that is hard to tell , but by their actions , they do appear to have a close relationship .
<user1> yes . he stares at the medicine for a while , like he 's reading the label .
<user1> yeah at the end to turn off the camera

<user1> he first seems to flap the rug to get wrinkles out , then folds it and lays it on the couch . then he picks up the dishes and walks out of the room .
<user1> i don 't think he changed his clothes
<user1> the man is looking in the mirror
<user1> he appears to be late 20s

<user1> maybe nothing else was around .
<user1> i don 't see any window so i think the light is on .

<user1> i would say it is daytime since it is light outside the window .
<user1> no . he just looks at the glass .

<user1> he sits through a good portion of the beginning .
<user1> yes he continues to cook the veggies
<user1> yes , it starts with him throwing the food

<user1> i heard no other person .
<user1> he just sits there and the video ends
<user1> he rinses the cup , takes a drink , bends down picks up something looks like a bag and walks down the hall leaving the room and the frame of the video .
<user1> it 's probably a bed room . he also has a broom underarm .

<user1> it 's hard to say . she walks off camera , but i can 't tell if she actually leaves the room .
<user1> one man walks down stairs carrying shoes . the other man carries a blue container with maybe food and he sits down at a table and picks through the container .

<user1> there are two people in the video .
<user1> when the video starts the man is folding clothes .
<user1> the man picks something off of the ground , messes with the vacuum then walks away .
<user1> it seems to be a liquid as he pours it in the cap and drinks it .

<user1> yes he is the only one there .
<user1> he does not add soap

<user1> there is one guy in the video
<user1> he was nothing to eat anything
<user1> just taking it apart before sneezing .

<user1> no she does not seem to notice her at all .
<user1> some kind of letter it looks like .
<user1> no he just washes the glass .
<user1> the room she runs into while eating a sandwich appears to be a hallway of sorts
<user1> he leaves it on the table .
<user1> he looks at one page then the video quits
<user1> he starts with the broom then grabs the remote
<user1> he picks a pencil up from the ground .
<user1> she then walks over to the bedroom door and opens it .
<user1> it has black and white strips
<user1> the little dish is sitting on the stove .

<user1> no , he 's only talking to the person on the phone .

<user1> there are two people in the video
<user1> the same as it starts with the man standing with the groceries and boy laughing on the phone .
<user1> again i am unable to see a sink just the door and the toilet paper along with the broom .
<user1> the camera does not show enough of the room to determine if it is a dorm room or living room .
<user1> the video begins with a man eating some sort of food .
<user1> sorry actually the person opens the door and leaves the room . besides that everything is covered .
<user1> no he just picked it up

<user1> there is one male and one female .
<user1> yes i think so so
<user1> she take book and sandwich and leave

<user1> there is one person in the video .
<user1> nothing she is drinking something from mug .
<user1> no , the rest of the video is just of him adjusting the lens and taking a picture several times
<user1> her phone conversation is just , " hello , yes , tomorrow , ok " , so she 's just playing around .
<user1> no , there is just rustling
<user1> she grabs some toys and sits in a chair

<user1> he is looking in the mirror i believe but i can 't see the mirror .
<user1> no he is wide awake
<user1> she seems more interested in fixing the crooked picture than thinking about vacuuming . she never leaves the top of the stairway .
<user1> a little bit in a foreign language
<user1> she was still writing in the middle
<user1> it appears to be as kitchen .
<user1> there are two people in this video . one walking up the stairs and one walking down the stairs .

<user1> yes thats all that happens in the video

<user1> they talk , but it 's difficult to make out what they 're saying
<user1> it 's a ridiculously neat fold
<user1> he is laughing because he might be experiencing mild psychosis or intoxicated on powerful medication
<user1> it seems he does nto fix it , after he is done his hands move away , so i think he stands up and leaves the room

<user1> the boy has a bottle of medicine in his hand .
<user1> some black sweat shirt and jeans
<user1> it is possible , but it 's hard to tell .
<user1> it appears they are in a bedroom or living room maybe .

<user1> he looks about twenty two
<user1> he opens a bag on the floor and takes out a red pillow .
<user1> no he just sets the coffee mug on the table . can 't see what might be in the cup .

<user1> she gets up and walks down a hallway to get to another room
<user1> he walks over to a desk and looks at a picture that is on the desk and begins laughing
<user1> its hard to tell , maybe a foyer or a storage room .
<user1> she saw something but i don 't know what it was

<user1> it is hard to tell if there is anything in the bottle because it is so far away , but it looks empty to me .
<user1> no i don 't see or hear anyone else .
<user1> it looks like a foyer
<user1> no she is just sitting there doing nothing .

<user1> he 's looking closely at the very small mirror
<user1> i can 't tell what he has
<user1> no , that covers all of the video
<user1> he starts to sweep the steps of the staircase as he walks down it .

<user1> he throws his phone on a chair , then walks over to some cabinets .
<user1> no , i didn 't see him drop anything
<user1> no , i dont hear anything .
<user1> it 's darker and hard to tell but i believe he walks into a living room .
<user1> she looks at the monitor and dabs her face with a towel .
<user1> the person is just stirring the coffee .
<user1> he does not type anything into his phone .
<user1> a man stands in the doorway of another room while the woman speaks and they laugh
<user1> yes , he did and about to take both the book and backpack away - but .
<user1> he walks into a bedroom
<user1> she seems to be in a neutral mood .
<user1> no i can 't hear him speaking and it doesn 't look like he said a word when he was in frame
<user1> a man is in the kitchen , lights up a burner , and takes a bite of a sandwich
<user1> no , she is eating the whole time .
<user1> no i 'm assuming it already has water in it
<user1> she could be . i am not sure
<user1> it was already sitting on the table .
<user1> it does look like he is trying to clean up some
<user1> he moves around a lot of items on the table , but more as he is looking for something than cleaning .
<user1> no , there are no pets around .
<user1> just plain old coca cola
<user1> well she see something in the closet
<user1> he continues to stand in the doorway .
<user1> nothing he just stands there and separates the bags and puts them on the bed .
<user1> he looks at it for five to ten seconds
<user1> not sure . maybe none of them . it 's probable that the woman sitting just was already in a mood of sorts but i can 't tell due to the language being foreign .
<user1> it appears he does not .
<user1> he takes a cell phone from a bag and puts it in his pocket .
<user1> he just appears a little groggy from sleeping
<user1> no she leaves with it in her hand
<user1> yes he opened a cabinet
<user1> no the video ends when the door shuts and i can 't see the front of the fridge just a partial side .
<user1> i can hear the cabinet door shut and the windchimes that is all .
<user1> he tosses it aside somewhere
<user1> he is standing and then lays down
<user1> no , half of the video she is not in the room yet .
<user1> no this dude is alone the whole time
<user1> we can see she 's by a mirror . most likely the bathroom .
<user1> a man is sitting on his bed looking at his phone .
<user1> yes , there is music in the background .
<user1> he walks away after getting the food .
<user1> i don 't hear any sound
<user1> the person is a man .
<user1> he never does take a sip
<user1> that 's it , but it does seem like after sneezing she is trying to get up and leave but the video ends
<user1> i gear the rustling of bags as he unloads his groveries . then he picks up a broom to clean the cookie crumbs and i hear the sweeping .
<user1> he is cream color skin
<user1> no , just the one woman .
<user1> yes , but only slightly annoyed .

<user1> the woman drinks from the the cup .
<user1> he seems to sit and look at the desk and the contents on top of the desk .
<user1> there is just the man

<user1> no there is no way to tell what time of day it is
<user1> i think this is kitchen
<user1> the video ends with her wiping the mirror .
<user1> he walks out the door .

<user1> you can 't tell , she only looks at it a few seconds
<user1> no all the bathroom items are lined up nicely
<user1> the person is just walking into the room when the video starts . i think its a woman .

<user1> he was alone in room

<user1> the women dose not speak in the video
<user1> nothing else happened in the video .

<user1> there is 1 girl in the video .

<user1> just the sound of the man slapping his boots together and the door opening .
<user1> it looks like a house but i don 't know if it 's theirs
<user1> it looks like athletic pants and a white tank top
<user1> a man who 's putting groceries away .

<user1> the window was closed in the beginning , then she opens it at the end .
<user1> he is pretending to sneeze .

<user1> it sounds like he might be or maybe allergies .
<user1> no , he is not crying .
<user1> i do not hear anything coming from the video .
<user1> that covers it , pretty basic .
<user1> there is audio , but just of his walking and picking up pans and stuff .
<user1> it looks like he might of taken the case off .
<user1> i cannot see what she is writing , i would guess madlibs
<user1> he is in the pantry the whole time
<user1> the room appears to be clean .
<user1> no , he holds the broom the whole time .

<user1> i saw no other people , why does he have a camera ?
<user1> yes the only one i can see

<user1> it appears to go down eary
<user1> one person in the video .
<user1> then he walks down the steps .
<user1> no noises that i can tell
<user1> he sneezes several times and has his shirt in one hand , the vacuum in the other .
<user1> it appears to be a seasoning bottle
<user1> she is crouched down for the first section
<user1> i cannot see a window .
<user1> it is cluttered but tidy
<user1> she is in the bathroom .
<user1> yes , she tidies up the floor
<user1> while she is cooking , she picks up what i think is a salt grinder and adds some of the to whatever it is she is cooking and then stirs the food .
<user1> yes he sneezes in to his elbow .
<user1> all he does is walk in the doorway and begins to sneeze . the clip is only 2 seconds long .
<user1> he reaches down for the blanket , but i can 't tell what it 's on . there is nothing after the window .
<user1> at the very end of the video he begins to take his shirt off .
<user1> yes , he is at the counter doing homework .
<user1> i 'm not sure it 's an amazon box but yes , that is what is happening .
<user1> no sound . just her cleaning the floor .
<user1> a man is standing with a coffee mug in his hand and smiling .
<user1> he didnt laugh and sneeze no noise
<user1> from the toilet , sink , medicine cabinet , and bathtub , i would discern a bathroom .
<user1> she is visible from the befining
<user1> it appears to be a natural sunlight .
<user1> he turns away from the stove and smiles
<user1> no he didnt watch tv he tidy some cloths on the floor
<user1> a woman is standing and takes a bit from a bread .
<user1> it looks light brown but the camera angles are bad .
<user1> probably 5 seconds or so while he folded the skirt / garment before putting it back down
<user1> no , there are no windows
<user1> he is eating a sandwich and drinking water as he looks in a mirror .
<user1> at the start she is standing on the box with homework in her hand , while laughing .
<user1> she says the phrase " how weird . "
<user1> it appears to be a stack of towels , a picture , and some paper
<user1> yes . they both remain in the room the whole time .
<user1> yes and she picks up the folder
<user1> yes , you have it all
<user1> he is alone the whole time .
<user1> no . he is just picking up dishes at this point
<user1> the older lady lays her bag on the table .
<user1> yes i can see only one man
<user1> yes , he paces a bit like he doesn 't know which way to go then exits stage right .
<user1> no there is not anything else
<user1> he laughs and walks back and forth .
<user1> no , that 's how the scene ends .
<user1> no , look at my answer . he doesn 't leave the room . the book falls onto the couch because of the sneeze .
<user1> the boy is standing outside holding a laptop and then walks into the house .
<user1> a lady is saying she has to go to the store and she has to look at something .
<user1> no he doesn 't shut any of the doors .
<user1> no she does not make a face .
<user1> the person is holding a pillow or throw cushion
<user1> yes this is the same towel once wrapped around her head she does something else
<user1> look like she might be going on a dinner date maybe
<user1> i believe it is daytime .
<user1> yes , this is throughout the video .
<user1> it looks like it takes place inside a bedroom .
<user1> it lvig roomnoilo ks ae ikl
<user1> he moves them out of the pantry .
<user1> yes , mostly the sound to tidying up around the toilet .
<user1> just with him reading the phone
<user1> no they are probably speaking a different language . i do know that it sounded like a kid behind the camera .
<user1> some sort of facebook game probably
<user1> that is pretty much it . you can also see her smiling as she 's looking at the laptop
<user1> no , in the beginning , he walks in and he picks some clothes up off the floor before throwing them back down
<user1> from what i recall i heard no voices
<user1> a man takes his shoes off before leaving a room .
<user1> a large room in what appears to be an office building .
<user1> no , i think we covered it all .
<user1> no . there is no sound at all during the video .
<user1> for the looks of it , it is a yoga mat
<user1> yes , fairly well lit hallway .
<user1> yes , that is how the video ends .
<user1> he pause 's for a few seconds after he cut the light on
<user1> i think he is in the dining room
<user1> to me it looks like a dining room area , with a ceiling fan .
<user1> after he sneeze and whisper something he then goes into a room with a computer in it .
<user1> i dont think that is happening
<user1> no , nothing that i can see .
<user1> he is just holding the handle
<user1> or it might be the kitchen
<user1> the room is lit so i believe so unless there 's a window i can 't see .
<user1> yes , he is in the video when it begins .
<user1> she picks it up then throws it
<user1> i do not see any pets
<user1> actually , i was wrong it is a table not a chair .
<user1> no he turns the light off then walks out the roo
<user1> she might be listening but never reacting . , also like she is following directions .
<user1> she took a sandwich and a book
<user1> she is in the kitchen .
<user1> no there is more in the video .
<user1> no he does not talk onl laughs
<user1> he is playing a video game
<user1> the shelf looks black and it is short in height
<user1> just background noise , nothing specific .
<user1> one is videoing the other two . one is sweeping and the other is carrying grogeries .
<user1> i dont see it clearly
<user1> not sure . but he wakes up and ate the sandwich
<user1> she walks right to the door without pausing , and she pushes the door to open it .
<user1> the woman is standing and the man is sitting .
<user1> yes she is the only one in the video
<user1> i guess it is but i can 't tell
<user1> yes , he is having a conversation .
<user1> yes he goes over and sits down after looking out the window
<user1> i think he does toward the end of the video
<user1> she wears a light green long sleeve shirt and a tight light blue purple pants and pink and white shoes .
<user1> yes , the man is clearly alone ?
<user1> no she isn 't wearing any shoes .
<user1> no he does not show any emotion
<user1> yes he is in the kitchen .
<user1> once he finishes with the groceries he puts dishes away
<user1> yes i think it is a bedroom .
<user1> yes , he takes out a bottle of medicine and cleans the bottle with a cloth
<user1> no there is nothing else , it ends with him walking off screen .
<user1> no , she enters the second room and then stays there .
<user1> the man is taking off his shirt and then folds it on his arm
<user1> no , they are not helping with the house work
<user1> he is cleaning a sink in a bathroom .
<user1> he does not do anything interesting .
<user1> the video ends with the woman closing the door .
<user1> no she comes in at the beginning
<user1> it 's a little in the back ground
<user1> he holds his pen and then he takes off his sandals and grabs for a cup .
<user1> before that he walks into the bathroom
<user1> yes it is a woman inside the video .
<user1> his back is to me , so i cannot tell what he is doing at the desk .
<user1> she was in the basement on the floor - these can go fast if you keep on target and ask the questions quickly .
<user1> it is one girl only
<user1> he puts the glass in the sink after drinking the water .
<user1> there is just background noise
<user1> she is just sitting there enjoying the music .
<user1> just sits down and looks around
<user1> yes , he is sitting on a sofa with a table in front of him .
<user1> its about 32 seconds long
<user1> probably traditional indian music , or possibly some pop-oriented variation on that type of music
<user1> i don 't think he is imo . would be risky having a laptop on top of a washer or dryer if he was
<user1> he stands up and grabs a broom
<user1> yes . all he does is repeatedly take a drink from the cup and he 's holding his shoes in his left hand .
<user1> no there isn 't . he 's standing with a pitcher of water
<user1> yes . he drinks from the cup the whole time
<user1> no , just laughs at himself , and points at himself twice .
<user1> i can hear a kid and someone talking but not the woman
<user1> it looks to me like she is the " camera operator " , and is ready to end the scene .
<user1> no just that it is light out .
<user1> after he works on the sink , he stands up and closes the cabinet doors .
<user1> the girl is half sitting half laying on the bed in the beginning
<user1> there is a table infront of her .
<user1> he is holding it and looking into it but not rummaging .
<user1> somewhat . i 'ts a white bag , pretty small in sizse
<user1> i can 't tell . the description says he stands up and puts dishes in the sink and walks towards the table but there are no dishes and he just gets up and walks out the door .
<user1> mid 30 ' s would be my guess .
<user1> not that i can see
<user1> looks like amole or somethingon his arm , can ; t tell
<user1> he picks up a homemade broom and begins to sweep the stairs while laughing
<user1> not really , he is just busy laughing
<user1> i can 't hear any noise on it no
<user1> no , she 's only holding the banana .
<user1> it looks like a book that he 's flipping in the air .
<user1> yes it is the same person the whole time .
<user1> if i were to guess i would say late 20 ' s
<user1> he goes into the closet and grabs a laptop from the top shelf
<user1> he takes a few bites out of the apple .
<user1> he looks to be checking messages
<user1> no . he is walking toward the coffee table where the green container is located .
<user1> no dirty clothes can be seen .
<user1> its hard to tell the time of day
<user1> there is a glass of water in his right hand .
<user1> i hear what sounds like a coin hitting the floor .
<user1> there is sound from the tv
<user1> a few books and some papers .
<user1> she is only using her hand .
<user1> a sweater and some sweatpants .
<user1> there are no pets in the video .
<user1> yes , that is about what happens
<user1> she is in a kitchen in a house .
<user1> the man and woman appear to be trying to fix the desk .
<user1> fairly quick . she has to put the foot part of the chair back in then she gets up right away
<user1> there is only one person
<user1> yes he opens the refrigerator door .
<user1> he 's standing on a rug .
<user1> looks like 30s in video
<user1> a man is laying on the sofa .
<user1> no i believe he is supposed to be dusting with a rag .
<user1> no , that covers everything that happens in the video .
<user1> there are two people in the video .
<user1> no , talking . just the noises of things being moved around and bumped into
<user1> he is sweeping the floor .
<user1> i can see the top of it and part of the seat that 's up but not the whole toilet .
<user1> no he seems to only be looking around and checking things out
<user1> he does not eat or drink .
<user1> she is standing there looking at her cell phone
<user1> i could not hear any noise of tv
<user1> no this is pretty much all they do , it 's kind of awkward .
<user1> no not really , just head
<user1> yes , you can hear the tv audio , it 's quite loud .
<user1> he only twist the tv . he does not hit any buttons .
<user1> the man was trying to repair something on a table or desk .
<user1> the first thing is this man walks into the kitchen and he sneezes .
<user1> drinking from a silver cup

<user1> he stood beside the cabinet
<user1> no there are no voices
<user1> he is going to lie down on the floor .
<user1> there are some items so

<user1> yes , no shoes the whole time
<user1> he is standing at the stairs with soem papers on his hands
<user1> no that is all there was .
<user1> he is in a bathroom .
<user1> it is a blue shirt that he is wearing .
<user1> it is the one he opens and closes .
<user1> just the sounds of him fidgeting .
<user1> it looks as if the person is at a home .
<user1> he folds 2 pieces of laundry then grabs the camera .
<user1> before putting the stuff in the refrigerator
<user1> he sits down in front of a tv .
<user1> yes , she is still in the frame .
<user1> the kid is opening the target bag and the man is laughing while looking at his phone .

<user1> it looks like a home office
<user1> i 'd guess it 's his living room .
<user1> it is hard to tell , the camera never moves , but perhaps
<user1> yes the man makes some coughing noises .
<user1> based on the video lighting i would guess that it is night time .
<user1> no , there are no windows that i can see .

<user1> the video is 30 seconds long
<user1> just the girl running out and then just some shuffling .

<user1> she doesn 't talk to anybody .

<user1> in his early to late 30 ' s .
<user1> i cannot tell as the lighting wasn 't very good
<user1> no he does not smile .

<user1> yes , he is holding a sandwich .

<user1> he could be in his 40
<user1> no they do not put the box down inside this video they are walking straight through the room that has the camera in it .
<user1> he takes a deep breath and downs a drink which was probably a glass of alcohol
<user1> probably in his 30s or 40s .
<user1> looks like a outdoor hallway
<user1> yes , the blanket is on her lap
<user1> nope , that is about it .
<user1> he sneezes and takes some medicine

<user1> he came into the room from the right side behind the camera .
<user1> yes , that is correct , when the video ends he is leaving the bedroom .
<user1> looks like he is holding a candy bar that he 's eating
<user1> yes , that is all he does . he may have been listening to some music , since i can hear noise at the beginning . around the middle of the scene the noise goes away .
<user1> he moves slowly i guess .
<user1> no . that 's about it . you could ask what they are wearing .
<user1> he 's sitting eating a picke

<user1> yes he is i dont know what it is in the pot

<user1> there is just one person in the video .
<user1> he looks at the book while eating the sandwhich
<user1> no , he is the only one in the video
<user1> yes , the video begins with her walking across the room .
<user1> he does not try to do so .

<user1> that is a great summary there is really nothing more going on .
<user1> i would say mid twenties
<user1> he sneezes which is why he takes medicine .
<user1> no he is not in my opinion , his cleaning is terrible .
<user1> a girl was just wiping down a cabinet
<user1> he is holding the water , then takes a drink , and then he laughs .
<user1> yes the bathroom window is what she closes .
<user1> dark brown to black in color .

<user1> no she just looks at her phone
<user1> she has a brom in one hand and a vaccum in another and using them both at the same tie
<user1> no the guy keeps his hat on
<user1> the location would be the living room
<user1> he opens the door , drapes the towel over the doorknob and leaves
<user1> i think he is happy .
<user1> green pants and dark top , casual wear .
<user1> no , the person never gets off the bed .
<user1> after walking into the video , the man picks up a television remote off of the nearby desk .
<user1> the women threw the clothes into a box by the bedroom closet
<user1> looks like a bedroom perhaps
<user1> i can hear a sports game playing in the background
<user1> yes there is some noise that might be coming from outside .
<user1> he 's standing on a pile of blankets on the floor
<user1> yes shes smiling and looking at him
<user1> yes , but i was unable to understand it .
<user1> yes he is sort of smiling .
<user1> it looks like he picked it up from the floor
<user1> the person gets undressed and puts the bathrobe on a chair and then they sneeze
<user1> yes he takes a sip then sets the cup down .
<user1> he is probably in california
<user1> he takes a plate from a shelf on the left and puts it on the ground .
<user1> no , he just vacuums for a minute and then puts the pot in the oven .
<user1> no , he 's only holding his cell phone
<user1> no he never speaks but the lady behind the camera does
<user1> yes he seems like that
<user1> and then he walks away .
<user1> he just holds it , he laughs while he grabs the bottle , he might have a mental illness
<user1> he gets up and goes into the kitchen and lifts a bag and then goes back into the living room .
<user1> there is only one person in the video .
<user1> the video is shot in the kitchen .
<user1> there is only one person .
<user1> yes , he looks to be in his late 30s .
<user1> yes . he needs to take them with the pitcher on the counter .
<user1> possibly a bedroom because he opens a closet door
<user1> that 's what he does last , he puts the cup back onto the counter
<user1> he never speaks at all
<user1> not that is about the extent of the video
<user1> no there isnt a sound
<user1> he seems like he is in a good mood .
<user1> it looks like a bedroom . i see a bed .
<user1> he goes there for like 3 seconds then re enters house
<user1> upon beginning the recording , she then approaches the lamp , turns on each bulb independently , and then seats herself at the table .
<user1> he doesn 't put the things down .
<user1> she the women does take her shoes off after she is done doing her homework
<user1> the lady takes a sip of tea in the beginning , camera pans to the man wiping his sneakers , and put them in the knapsack , then just some laughing & talking .
<user1> yes , he is alone in video
<user1> after he wraps the blanket in his arms , he picks up a broom and then throws it on the ground . after that he just wanders around the place .
<user1> yes he is buttoning his shirt
<user1> yes , the room is very packed and cramped , she doesn 't have much room to move around .
<user1> yes there is only one person in the video .

<user1> she takes a couple drinks , stands up and puts the cup in the sink .
<user1> no i do not see any

<user1> he uses a pocket knife and starts to open it when the clip ends
<user1> the door opens and a girl comes in .
<user1> sorry i just rewatched the video there is a child and an animal watching tv when the camera pans , no touching of any kind
<user1> no you cannot hear anything at all in the video .
<user1> no he sits by himself in the room for the duration
<user1> she reaches for the door knob ...
<user1> it does , the only sounds are from the water running , and of him washing the jar .
<user1> i cannot see where they land .
<user1> i think it is a bed room
<user1> no did not see they touch any thing else
<user1> no , he just looks at the camera a lot and sorts of frowns
<user1> no in the whole video he is laying there .
<user1> no just standing near the stove
<user1> no she just takes it off the shelf on the bed headboard .
<user1> no , there are no other crucial details that would describe what is happening in the video . the man looks at the camera , puts his jacket on , and then is taking a picture of something on the door .
<user1> no , aside from the splashing here and there , and the man moving around , there is no music or voices heard .
<user1> he picks up a glass of water from the table and takes a couple of sips of it .
<user1> i can see one person in video
<user1> no there is nobody else .
<user1> he laughs a little bit and walks away
<user1> there is no date and i have no idea when it was made .
<user1> yeah , that 's about it , it 's a wooden dining room type chair .
<user1> i 'm not sure , the person is not pictured at the end .
<user1> no i never see a tv but he does go through a doorway at the bottom of the chair
<user1> no , you can always see him .
<user1> she does not really give a reaction to the smell
<user1> yes there is kids in the backgroud
<user1> yes he is alone in the video .
<user1> he also holds a box and puts it down
<user1> when she 's walking up the stairs her back is towards the camera so you can 't tell . when she gets to the window she takes a bite .
<user1> yes , she opens the door and is heading out of it .
<user1> after he pull the cover .
<user1> he puts the bottle on the counter right in front of the camera .
<user1> no , he doesn 't open the window
<user1> the man just walks out of the room .
<user1> yeah he stirs the food a few times
<user1> at the beginning , the tall sitting one on the right is eating chips from a bag , and the man on the left is laying on the bed talking on phone .
<user1> he puts it down eventually
<user1> she exits the room after what i said in the first comment . i do not know what else is on the plate it doesn 't show .
<user1> i hear his sneezing and the container hitting the dresser
<user1> just the sound of the mans shuffling feet .
<user1> she does not turn the oven on .
<user1> there are two people . a women and a man .
<user1> yes , the person is a man .
<user1> no there isnt any noise
<user1> we do not hear the water rujnning .
<user1> the video ends with her standing at the stove looking at the food .
<user1> he 's holding onto a blanket
<user1> its hard to say , maybe the lobby ?

<user1> no he never said anything
<user1> he looks very happy . he speaks in a foreign language to the camera before he gets up to go to the fridge .
<user1> no , no music playing .
<user1> no he appears to be fine .
<user1> he also drinks from a cup
<user1> it really looks like a framed photo to me but like a paper type frame from a photographer
<user1> no he is just swinging it around .
<user1> yes , afterwards he reaches and eats something from a plate near the stove .
<user1> he is fully clothed throughout the video .
<user1> yes , there is talking in the background
<user1> no he puts it back on the counter .
<user1> no he doesn 't choke on the water .
<user1> he picks up a jewelry box and walks toward the camera
<user1> he appears to be a bit pale , however overall other than sneezing , in okay health .

<user1> it is a woman in the video
<user1> he is holding the blanket with both hands .
<user1> yes , it 's the first thing she does .
<user1> i cannot see the screen .
<user1> nothing other than background sound .
<user1> yes he hears noises and just looks that way and then takes a drink after putting the book down .
<user1> he was playing with his phone and then look into the laundry room
<user1> he is first seen standing in front of the stove making a sandwich .
<user1> nothing . he only searches through a bowl on the counter , and keeps drinking .
<user1> i hear the noise of him eating the chips and the bag .
<user1> no he just goes through the mail
<user1> you can hear the sweeping and some thumps but that 's it .
<user1> nothing that i can think of .
<user1> nobody else is visible in the video .
<user1> no , he gets it all over the computer
<user1> looks like a small box , not sure what is in it
<user1> she is laughing the whole time in the video .
<user1> i can 't tell which room
<user1> i think i remember a tv on .
<user1> there is only one person shown but you can hear the other person filming
<user1> yes his face is visible
<user1> she rolled it across the floor .
<user1> yes , there is some type of food on the plate , but i can 't tell what it is
<user1> he puts it back on the table but he always has a good grip on it .
<user1> it looks like day time
<user1> the man opens a door , but never fully leaves the room .
<user1> i don ` t know , i can ` t see that clear , a small bucket , maybe some yogurt
<user1> no he never speaks in this clip
<user1> i 'm not sure what room she is in it is a pretty tight shot on her .
<user1> he is looking at paper and typing
<user1> another person comes into it
<user1> you need 10 questions to be done
<user1> its a brownish color i believe .
<user1> no , it seems as if she is trying to fix it
<user1> there is no music playing in the background
<user1> it lasted about 20 seconds .
<user1> yes , but he does go over to the other side of the counter .
<user1> i can hear traffic outside .
<user1> yes , she bites into it shortly after picking it up
<user1> no , the woman is not talking
<user1> i doubt you see pets in your pictures , so i do not know why you would ask me that . i do not see pets .
<user1> it 's at a strange angle so i can 't see right on to the desk so it 's hard to tell .
<user1> yes the other person is sleeping
<user1> he gets a glass from a cabinet and pours himself a glass of water .
<user1> no then after some time she just starts cleaning up some stuff that is on the stairs . that 's all in the video .
<user1> you only see his shirt and his blanket while laying on the bed and he uses his phone .
<user1> she opened the door and came in
<user1> they look funny and happy
<user1> yes that is the first thing that happens .
<user1> no i can not hear sound
<user1> no one else is in the room with him
<user1> apart from running in the room and closing the door , no .
<user1> no i did not see any pets or people
<user1> yes she finishes the drink then washes some dishes at the sink .
<user1> no , she is not washing clothes .
<user1> it looks like it might be a kids book .
<user1> no it is two little girls .
<user1> no . after bumping into the table he walks out of the room .
<user1> no , he does nothing with the bed and remains standing in the same spot .
<user1> there is a cheesy song playing in the background but no talking .
<user1> no he is actually laughing at the end .
<user1> yes exactly , you have illustrated the narrative of the video precisely
<user1> they are talking to one another but it is not in english .
<user1> no it 's not a box it 's a duffle bag i think , she tosses the cloth into it , then picks up the phone
<user1> i can 't really tell , but looks like bathroom stuff .
<user1> no there is no one else in the video
<user1> yes i see the washer .
<user1> late 20 ' s i would say .
<user1> at the end she walks out but looks like still in same room
<user1> no , he never leaves the room .
<user1> i don 't know . not showing any emotions
<user1> no he just sits there and looks at a tv .
<user1> she was wearing a pink top .
<user1> he only glances at it and places it back in the phone book .
<user1> yes she is the one i can see .
<user1> she gets up and stretches and walks out of the room .
<user1> she is wearing grey pants .
<user1> i can not tell the man 's mood
<user1> yes he gets up and lights a small stove .
<user1> no , you got it all .
<user1> yes , he gets something out of a drawer and put it in a box .
<user1> he goes back and forth between screen , like watching something and then does something else , maybe editing something , but not 100 % sure
<user1> he cleans the desk a little at the end .
<user1> no socks on the man
<user1> can 't tell , its at a laptop
<user1> he never eats the snacks .

<user1> yes , after he plays on the cell phone .
<user1> he picks up a book from the desk .
<user1> no , he is going at a steady pace .
<user1> it looks like it might be a bedroom because the furniture looks like a footpost of a bed .
<user1> nothing he is in the middle of the floor
<user1> a woman who is wearing all black .
<user1> the man is visible in front of the window at the top of the stairs at the end .
<user1> no he is inside a house
<user1> it looks like some sort of cartoon
<user1> yes , she opened it pretty further .
<user1> a young boy storms into a messy room .
<user1> the video ends with the man ( i misspoke when i referred to the person as a woman ) at the sink doing something that can not be fully seen in the video .
<user1> yes he is sitting on the floor
<user1> yes , he goes out of the door and then shuts it behind him .
<user1> 33 seconds and i havent got to the end yet
<user1> no the video starts with her in the room .
<user1> he did not say anything during the recording .
<user1> yes she is alone in the video
<user1> he takes a drink from a cup on the desk and he is eating something from a bag he has in his lap .
<user1> the whole sandwich looks like fried dough but i dont know what it is .
<user1> holding a pillow and drinking some coffee or tea
<user1> i would say he seems pretty relaxed .
<user1> the woman is cleaning the mirror .
<user1> i think a striped shirt
<user1> that is correct . she folds the first piece of clothing and lays it on the bed . she folds the second piece of clothing and it stays on her lap .
<user1> a man starts out asleep in bed ?
<user1> yes . he changes then puts the other shirt on the shelf .
<user1> he is in the living room .
<user1> yes . there is one person laying on a bed
<user1> she opens the box up
<user1> he probably walked into the kitchen .
<user1> looks like a simple laundry room inside a residential house
<user1> no i dont hear any thing
<user1> he is eating some chocolates .
<user1> she works on her computer for a bit , takes a phone call , leaves the room and then returns with groceries shortly after .

<user1> no he does not . he is outside
<user1> yes there is only one person .
<user1> there is 1 person in the video
<user1> there is only one young man in the room .
<user1> there is nobody speaking in the video . the room is fairly quiet .
<user1> the first thing he does is pour a drink from the pitcher into a cup
<user1> no one is talking in the video .
<user1> just a man , but a woman is recording .
<user1> it looks like some kind of stool
<user1> it is hard to tell but it does not look like she smiles .
<user1> he is not drinking anything
<user1> he just walks out of the scene .
<user1> yes , that is all that happens .
<user1> yes but nothing that is worth knowing . i just noticed the tv is on but it is maybe a screen from a computer . nothing important .
<user1> yes , he bites the sandwich quite a few times .
<user1> yes , someone is counting in the background
<user1> yes those are eggs on the counter
<user1> background noises can be heard .
<user1> he grabbed off the top of one of the washing machines .
<user1> yes he is present in the entire .
<user1> there are no pets that i can see .
<user1> yes she jogs a bit but then she walks toward the camera .
<user1> i don 't hear any music
<user1> there is a boy and an older teen . the boy is putting his shoes on .
<user1> it looks day because there is light coming through the window
<user1> he seems mid 20 ' s or so . i can hardly see the person .
<user1> no she does not turn the lights off
<user1> she turns and leaves the room from a different direction that she came in from .
<user1> beside him is a cabinet of stuff .
<user1> she puts the towel down
<user1> no there is not a portrait of anyone .
<user1> he just holds it in his hands
<user1> it 's still only loaded half way through . the man just put his mug down .
<user1> he opens the closest door first .
<user1> no he was only walking through .
<user1> no he does not talk to anyone .
<user1> some background noise in it
<user1> nothing music in this videow
<user1> yes she is alone in the room .
<user1> she is standing at the stove stirrin ng a pot
<user1> stands up , turns around and flips light off and on .
<user1> no , the video is silent .
<user1> there is one young man in the clip .
<user1> no that is basically all , other than she is wearing a purple sweatshirt .
<user1> no cup . the video pans to his friend pretending to use a toothbrush at the sink .
<user1> yes , the other man stays in the room
<user1> i think he in the living room
<user1> i can 't tell what kind of sandwich it is
<user1> just one person in the video .
<user1> no he does not speak
<user1> then the guy who brought in the glass of water leaves the room .
<user1> no he is concentrating on hitting the right switch
<user1> yes , but it is out of shot
<user1> he is not talking to anyone .
<user1> no , he never leaves the couch .
<user1> no , i don 't believe there are any pets around .
<user1> no he just puts the dishes away
<user1> i would guess late teens early 20 ' s
<user1> he chokes at first and appears to be laughing later
<user1> i dont think he finishes the sandwich
<user1> no , that 's where it ends . he spends a good 10-12 seconds laughing hard .
<user1> she then walks out of camera view
<user1> the blanket makes a sound as he flaps it to get it folded , then you hear him sneeze a couple of times , and the dishes clink together when he picks them up
<user1> there is none , i am sure of that .
<user1> the bag of chips are either white or yellow
<user1> the carpet is all brown .
<user1> just the one man is in the video .
<user1> there are two young boys having a talk
<user1> he may be in the living room .
<user1> they weren 't down , he just adjusted them .
<user1> no it is not timestamped .
<user1> yes the man sits on sofa
<user1> the man hurries into the bathroom , he is not in there to begin with .
<user1> i can see only one person in the video
<user1> yes he sits in the chair
<user1> yes , he 's the only person in the video .
<user1> yes he walked the entire time
<user1> no , there is no sound coming from the laptop .
<user1> no just the window and reading the book
<user1> early 30 ' s , age range 28-35
<user1> the place looks a little cluttered .
<user1> the man open the cabinet doors .
<user1> he seems to be looking for someone to come .
<user1> do he is gently tapping it . it could be seen as exercising as it seems purposeful .
<user1> yes , he 's certainly indoors here .
<user1> perhaps he is about 24-25
<user1> he looks to be either in his late teens or early twenties .
<user1> yes when she enters the video she puts it down on the sink
<user1> yes . he does appear to be looking at something .

<user1> i was wrong about the camera , it zooms in and out and side to side , but not walking . yes the blanket is the first thing you see

<user1> sitting in a chair looking at someone in another room .
<user1> she goes toward the camera

<user1> she doesn 't , she 's short and can barely see into the mirror and she 's trying to clean it . he thinks it 's funny telling her she missed a spot . he laughs about it .
<user1> he walks in to the table then starts removing things from the bag
<user1> he is laying on a sofa watching videos on his laptop
<user1> she does not say anything , but sneezes .
<user1> yes after throwing the towel down he removes it from his shirt pocket and begins to scroll through the phone
<user1> well since i cannot be 100 % sure i am taking an educated guess that since the liquid in thin and clear it is water
<user1> there is just the sound of them going up the stairs , loudly .
<user1> i assume so . the camera follows her until she runs away
<user1> he sweeps the entire floor
<user1> just noise of her walking and moving a chair on the floor
<user1> i see some ladders and junk stacked on the shelves .
<user1> no they didnt put the hands there
<user1> i can 't tell from the scene what day it is .
<user1> he picks a blanket up off the floor and puts it on the chair , then proceeds to grab a blue coffee mug and sit on the floor .

<user1> she is carrying a cell phone that is on . she then puts the cell phone on the table .

<user1> that 's correct . he entered the room from another room .
<user1> yes he catches it and then gets up , opens a door , and leaves .
<user1> he hard it with him
<user1> he is in the stairwell for the whole video .
<user1> it appears that he is in the bathroom
<user1> this looks like a dining room .
<user1> other than the sounds he makes walking through the house , no .
<user1> no other sounds than what i mentioned .
<user1> no but i can hear voices from a tv .
<user1> stays in one spot putting things into the box .
<user1> the pages look white from what i can tell .
<user1> no , he remains sitting on the desk the entire time
<user1> a bucket with some water in it . thats when the video starts .
<user1> he picks up a small laptop from the back of the couch , opens it and holds it and types .
<user1> the room to the right at the end of the video appears to be the living room .
<user1> he never takes a picture , just exams the camera .
<user1> the room seems to be the kitchen
<user1> no he stays near a closet door but laughs
<user1> it appears to be chips .
<user1> he picks up dishes from a table and takes them into a kitchen .
<user1> checks herself out in the mirror , puts something down on the counter and then finally hits a key on her laptop to stop recording .
<user1> it showed the empty room for a little bit before the girl walked in .
<user1> yes , he places the bottle of water that he picked up back down on the floor , and tosses the pillow on the bed .
<user1> no music at all in this video
<user1> i don 't think so . it looks like he is just watching something .
<user1> i can not see that clearly in the video
<user1> a small bottle of dark liquid .
<user1> one man walks into the room .
<user1> he was just sitting in a chair then got up walked over to the window and looked out
<user1> yes , they are indoors the steps are
<user1> he begins to look for stuff and talk to himself .
<user1> no he dose not he still stays there sitting down
<user1> she just picks up one piece of clothing before grabbing her cell phone .
<user1> he looks hungry . he just waits for his food and sips his coffee
<user1> it is a blanket on a floor
<user1> no she had more like a neutral expression
<user1> the video lasts 31 seconds .
<user1> he put it over himself
<user1> yes , he is doing homework .
<user1> it 's a black bag , not sure what it is made of .
<user1> there are background noises but no speaking or music .
<user1> yes she walks through a hallway down some stairs
<user1> he was just rifling through the pages , not really reading anything
<user1> not at all , did not even touch the sink
<user1> it ends before you can see if he locks it .
<user1> its hard to tell but it looks like it is
<user1> not after she comes in and sits on her bed .
<user1> he is on the phone , but all he does is laugh .
<user1> she is cooking and taking some medicine for her cough
<user1> yes , you got it . that 's what happens .
<user1> no , i don 't believe he did speak during the clip .
<user1> no the scene ends with him looking back to the shelf
<user1> yes but it 's quiet and i can 't understand it , they laugh a bit
<user1> either a dark blue or black
<user1> not that i am aware of
<user1> yes , he is sweeping the foyer to his apartment
<user1> the door is already open .
<user1> yes he was fully engaged with his phone
<user1> he is using what looks like a spatula to stir .
<user1> yes they are all alone
<user1> he is in a living room in the video .
<user1> no he does not have shoes on
<user1> the man is just standing there .
<user1> the guy is tidying up the table
<user1> yes he does at the end
<user1> i believe it is a woman
<user1> the video is 16 seconds long
<user1> the guy in the chair looks at the door and then looks down at the shoes
<user1> she washes for 25 seconds .
<user1> just the sound of him sneezing and tidying things
<user1> no that is all she uses .
<user1> he looked down . he was trying to find something on the floor .
<user1> no , he doesn 't seem to be in any hurry .
<user1> he walks out of the room to the right .
<user1> no i can 't tell what 's on his shirt
<user1> it is a phone that she uses .
<user1> his head gets cut from view as he moves towards the video . he pops two in his hand , then lifts his hand off screen , hand comes down empty , he closes bottle .
<user1> he cracks them and stares out the window .
<user1> no , she literally just stands there expressionless and not moving at all , just watchinghim
<user1> no nothing else important in here
<user1> it does not show that but she was running into the room and closed the door behind her before trying to prop it shut so maybe
<user1> a man is standing on the stairs with a bag
<user1> sounds like some cars on the street .
<user1> the first thing he does is take his shirt off while sitting down
<user1> the room looks nice and clean .
<user1> she never tastes anything in the video
<user1> he does open the closet door in order to put shoes away .
<user1> there is a young man who enters
<user1> yes , there is one smile after a small chuckle like he was remembering something .
<user1> there is one guy in the video .
<user1> no , i think we covered it all .
<user1> no they are looking at clothes
<user1> the video is less than 30 seconds long
<user1> yes he is . near a window

<user1> the girl walks in and hangs her jacket up .
<user1> yes he is sitting at the start .
<user1> no people but there is a dog for a brief second
<user1> he walks across the room and goes downstairs .
<user1> i 'm not sure what you know or not .
<user1> when he opened the door , it looked kind of dark out so maybe night time .
<user1> he looks out the window
<user1> yea a brown one and also maybe a vest on top of it
<user1> just background noise , no conversation .
<user1> yes he is wearing a jacket .
<user1> no , she does not drink from it
<user1> no , he 's alone in the room .

<user1> he stays standing in the same spot filming .
<user1> yes that is all that the man did .
<user1> the frame starts with her standing in the doorway .
<user1> no he never goes near the window
<user1> something inside the bag has caused him to crack up .
<user1> i can 't tell from the angle shot in the video .
<user1> the first thing he does is he neatens up the shelf , making the book / dvds upright and such
<user1> no he does not close the closet door .
<user1> it appears they are , but i can 't see the tv .
<user1> all he does is mess with the vacuum and look in the mirror .
<user1> there is no food around in the video , and she does not sit back down .
<user1> maybe add that he looks into the tv like a mirror and assesses his appearance and fixes his hair , then runs out of the room
<user1> yes he was the only one
<user1> he folded only one towel .
<user1> i cannot see any windows in the video .
<user1> no , he doesn 't drink the beverage
<user1> no , it is not a finished basement .
<user1> yes there is only one person .
<user1> the man does not show any particular emotion .

<user1> no , she walks toward the camera with the clothing and then it ends .
<user1> i 'm not certain . i can see the front end of a car , and a lot of " stuff " , but he closes the door so quickly it 's hard to tell what he was looking at .
<user1> she sneezes and covers her faxce again

<user1> the camera dude says something in a language i dont know
<user1> he is walking in to laundry room
<user1> it looks like he is in a kitchen
<user1> yes he stays in the same room .
<user1> it 's just a nondescript cardboard box , like cream cheese would come in if ordered by the case .
<user1> the laptop was in a black case .
<user1> he is maybe in his 50s .
<user1> yes he seems to be happy
<user1> he begins twisting back and fourth .
<user1> she is eating something from the plate .

<user1> yes , this person approaches the cabinet and takes something out of it .
<user1> he does not clean anything else
<user1> after he unloads his basket he stands up and looks inside his empty basket and the video ends .
<user1> when he first walks in , he takes off a jacket .
<user1> she was sitting down drinking a glass of water . she appeared to be pretty thirsty
<user1> i think he is hurried and busy
<user1> i did not see any she dries her hands on her pants and shirt
<user1> he just puts it back in there .
<user1> in the entire video so
<user1> he continues to talk on the phone
<user1> i could not determine that from the video .
<user1> no that is all that he does .
<user1> i 'd say he 's about 22 years old .
<user1> he is attempting to put it on .
<user1> he just picks up a box and looks at it .
<user1> open door ways but they are unlit or out of visual range to see into .
<user1> a room nearby a washing machine . hard to tell exactly from the small angle .
<user1> yes very blue and bright
<user1> no , he never takes anything else out of his bag .
<user1> i don 't see any but he gets up and walks towards an open door

<user1> no i believe it 's a metal spoon .
<user1> hes ' drinking a cup of liquid
<user1> yes . there is an office and a person is standing there

<user1> he is white i am assuming
<user1> i dont think so , just the person doing some work .
<user1> not very big , on the small side
<user1> yes , the talking is in a foreign language so it is unknown what they are talkign about .
<user1> yes he seems to be alone
<user1> the man walks in the room and sneezes

<user1> he sits on a bench in front of a table or counter .
<user1> he stands up to pick something from the floor to keep on a table perhaps and the video ends
<user1> he does not walk on the stairs .
<user1> i see no evidence of pets
<user1> no , the only thing i can hear is the 4 times he sneezes .

<user1> they do not laugh or talk in the video .
<user1> he walks into a room and starts to undress
<user1> she walks to my right , out of the frame .
<user1> i would say yes ... but at the end of the video the man walks to the right and reaches down to a shelf and picks up a sandwich on a plate ... sooo not so sure
<user1> the video ends with the man talking to the camera .
<user1> it looks like a living room .
<user1> yes , that is all that happens
<user1> there is one that you can see on camera and one you can see off camera .
<user1> yes he is smiling in the video
<user1> he zips the backpack back up and puts the book bag over one shoulder and that is how the video ends .
<user1> yes , the child can be seen clearly in the video .
<user1> the window looks like it was already open but she doesn 't touch the window .
<user1> only a hum from some device and the sounds of her moving stuff .
<user1> he sets a plastic bag down and then grabs something red and crunchy to eat but i don 't think it 's an apple .
<user1> shen walks out of the laundry room .
<user1> she stays on the same page the whole time .

<user1> yes , you can see him clearly wearing one .
<user1> they shut the door then open it and walk again within view
<user1> he just stands there shuffling and looks up to the ceiling smiling . i might guess he was high .
<user1> he exits to the left .
<user1> i think it 's a combo dining / living .
<user1> he grabs the close out of the bag then starts walking out of the room .
<user1> she 's just staring into her eyes , emotionless , no futzing with her hair or makeup .
<user1> he is holding a book that he then puts on top of the refrigerator

<user1> she is sitting at the bottom of the stair case and hold a cellphone and takes a picture of herself .
<user1> he is laying on a bed with a vacuum next to him .

<user1> there is only one person .

<user1> no , she is not taking pictures . she is filming the video .
<user1> he looks to be in his 20s .
<user1> yes , he 's alone in the room .

<user1> no , the man does not talk to anyone
<user1> no there is another person in the video too .
<user1> no she just places it on the table

<user1> she is in study room
<user1> not really , it is a very uneventful clip .
<user1> yes , the man is the only one in the video .
<user1> she is holding a bottle of medicine in her hands
<user1> no i can ; t tell what he 's drinking
<user1> he appears to be reading , he does not actually clean , just collecting cleaning supplies
<user1> nope just the one child
<user1> they are both standing there in the whole video .
<user1> then he sneezes and closes his phone .
<user1> the person is a female .
<user1> yes , the video starts with the man working on the tv
<user1> he is in the room the entire time .
<user1> no . he just opens the door and proceeds by closing it behind him and thats when the video ends .
<user1> i didn 't hear or see anything else .
<user1> almost when she looks at the camera . other than that , no .
<user1> yes he is playing a game .
<user1> nothing , it was a very simple video , nothing much was done
<user1> not at all . he is holding a little mirror and moving little things on the desk
<user1> just a little bit i can hear it
<user1> it 's a 30 second video . maybe he stares at it longer than 10 seconds but he just stares at it with his thumbs in his pockets .
<user1> it does look that way
<user1> just the sund of the door closing .
<user1> yes , you see his leg at the start of the video
<user1> no she does not speak
<user1> no , he was there from the beginning .
<user1> yes she sneezes twice in the video .
<user1> no , there is not any background noise .
<user1> yes , she stands after fixing it and remains that way .
<user1> because that 's what the description says above the video .
<user1> probably around 18 or 19
<user1> he does not do anything else
<user1> she put things in the box
<user1> he stays the entire time
<user1> a few items i also found it odd that he stirred the contents of the pan on the table like he did .
<user1> that 's hard to say . i only see the side of her face then the back of her head .
<user1> i cannot tell and he does not say anything .
<user1> a man is walking in to the scene .
<user1> no , i think only a man and a camera man are there .
<user1> no he never speaks , he i guess its supposed to be a sneeze
<user1> while vacuuming he coughs into his hand .
<user1> she puts dishes in the sink
<user1> i would guess about 4 books .
<user1> she is wearing a nice sari but it seems like everyday type clothing , nothing too fancy .
<user1> yes that it all that happens .
<user1> he doesn 't show any emotion .
<user1> no , the camera does not move .
<user1> he stays sitting the whole time .
<user1> no the door stays open the whole time
<user1> she looks like she is white to me .
<user1> he doesnt say anything at all .
<user1> he picks up a pillow and shakes it the entire video
<user1> no , nothing is being eaten .
<user1> he sits down in a chair .
<user1> she starts to open a bottle of water and the video goes off .
<user1> it is a little odd but i can not tell what he is doing
<user1> he puts the bottle back on the sink and walks out of the room
<user1> there is some faint background noise and no he does not speak
<user1> there is no audio in the video
<user1> no , he throws a piece of clothing in .
<user1> maybe because he was cold and he wanted to hold against him
<user1> i only see one person in the video .
<user1> a man in a hoodie appears to be trying to sleep
<user1> no i cant hear any other noise except a little speaking
<user1> she sneezes a couple of times
<user1> no he seems actually happy .
<user1> no just the one man .
<user1> it doesn 't sound like english .
<user1> he was totally poker face but i assume scared when he run away
<user1> no she is already carrying it
<user1> yes this man does take a drink
<user1> he stands there the whole time .
<user1> yes the tv is on
<user1> no he seems to be alone
<user1> i can 't tell what kind of camera it is
<user1> the only noises are background noises .
<user1> he did not move he just sat in that one place .
<user1> i do not think so i cannot tell what expression in on her face .
<user1> he don 't never take of his coat
<user1> there seems to be a circle pattern on it
<user1> she puts the papers down on the table .
<user1> no . she just tosses it onto the floor .
<user1> yes , he 's alone the whole time .
<user1> there is only one person in the video
<user1> younger i guess . his face is not shown .
<user1> looks like someones bedroom . maybe his .
<user1> no he gets up at the end .
<user1> yes i think so in the video
<user1> she stands up at the beginning of the video to touch the camera , and again at the end to stop it .
<user1> she doesn 't fall but it 's pretty convincing .
<user1> no he throws a pillow
<user1> they were just standing and the last guy was talking on his phone
<user1> i believe that she is turning on the camera .
<user1> she keep it up in the air .
<user1> he continues to hold his jacket .
<user1> yes , just the one guy .
<user1> yes , it 's just one guy
<user1> she is in her late teens or early 20s . good job
<user1> no , that is pretty much it .
<user1> she continues playing and flipping over this pillow .
<user1> it looks like he is sitting in a kitchen .
<user1> the video never makes an mention of why he is smiling .
<user1> no he does not carry them
<user1> nothing really , just sort of pops in for a few seconds in the middle of the scene .
<user1> no i do not hear anything
<user1> no she does not tidy up the room
<user1> yes she walks into the room firsst then sits on the floor by the bed
<user1> he actually puts a different bowl into the kitchen sink .
<user1> no they do not speak
<user1> yes , except that the man continues up the steps after taking the picture .
<user1> it 's hard to tell , you never see his face .
<user1> yes you can see him walk up but video stops before he goes all the way .
<user1> he does have something in his hand . possibly a game controller .
<user1> he looks like taking some photos with his phone
<user1> the standing one looks pretty annoyed .
<user1> i do not think it a house the man enters
<user1> he is fixing the chair while he is lying on the floor
<user1> he comes through the front door .
<user1> cleaning the glass table it seems
<user1> there are electronic accessories on his computer
<user1> he is putting on his shoes .
<user1> boy is looking at a book
<user1> yes , he never leaves the room .
<user1> she squats down to get the food out of the fridge .
<user1> yes there are two guys and they appear to be repairing
<user1> he leaves the closet at the end of the video .
<user1> yes he is wearing some sort of black shoes
<user1> yes , momentarily , but returns to the table .
<user1> just background sound - nothing else .
<user1> that is not a question .
<user1> she vacuums and then she goes and looks in the mirror
<user1> no , the person is not holding anything else
<user1> with the man going outside .
<user1> yes he is in the chair
<user1> yes , there is just one man
<user1> he had the towel in his hands at the start of the video .
<user1> first he shuffles through some papers , then he sits for a moment , then he gets up and walks away
<user1> yes he is cleaning the window with a rag and a shop vac
<user1> he eats the chips for the rest of the video
<user1> it doesnt looks like a bedroom . it looks like a storage room
<user1> no she sits on the floor cleaning the shoes for the entire video
<user1> he picked up one blanket off the floor .
<user1> the empty entryway is shown .
<user1> she sneezes after looking up at a light
<user1> the kitchen is clean for a mans kitchen
<user1> she grabs a black plastic bag and starts picking up the items she threw and put them in the bag .
<user1> it looks like a sandwich in his other hand .
<user1> no , there is no audio .
<user1> no just put his bag on his shoulder
<user1> no she did not sit down
<user1> he has a phone in one hand and a sandwich in the other and he takes a bite of the sandwich
<user1> it looks to be a glass , maybe with water inside it .
<user1> the man goes and sits on the couch and cuddles with the blanket
<user1> white with some sort of small logo on it .
<user1> i do think i have told you all that happens , short clip .
<user1> his expression is pretty neutral
<user1> that is all correct and in order
<user1> it seems to be in a bedroom ; the person enters holding a box of what turns out to be tools , she begins sneezing , and then tried to awkwardly fix the shelf with a tool she pulled from a package in the box , she then exits .
<user1> the boy does not have any mishaps .
<user1> yes , he is sitting on his bed playing with his shoelaces .
<user1> then starts to play a instrument
<user1> he is looking at a bag of food .

<user1> she sneezes into a towel
<user1> yes staring at her face in the mirror laughing while touching her face
<user1> no , she puts them on herself .
<user1> yes , he probably does . so he will put it in the dryer first .
<user1> yes , the person recording is giving him instructions in a foreign language .

<user1> he doesn 't show any emotion so i 'm not sure he does .
<user1> no , you can just hear the sounds of him moving around / moving things
<user1> it 's hard to tell . the walls are painted white and the windowframe is wooden , which doesn 't look industrial , but the sound is like a business .

<user1> he is bent over the desk in the beginning writing on some paper .
<user1> he uses a camera to take the picture .

<user1> after he watches the tv
<user1> just at first , after that he is picking stuff up .

<user1> he grabed some food and a couple of bottles
<user1> i don 't see what he is drinking
<user1> they do not head back down .

<user1> nothing at all , after sweeping he closes closet door and leaves
<user1> he walks to the fridge and reaches the handle
<user1> he then slowly close the room doo . r
<user1> he turns from the closet with the laptop and starts to walk out of the room

<user1> no , they walk out of camera view toward the end .
<user1> he gets up and walks toward a woman looking in the mirror

<user1> no , there is no communication that happens .
<user1> no he stays at the top
<user1> nothing else that 's basically all that happens . besides him patting his own head for a second .
<user1> i would say younger than 18 but older than 8 .
<user1> there is some noise when he sits down .
<user1> no , but everything is cluttered on shelfs and tables .
<user1> i can 't tell if he 's tired .
<user1> he appears to be 35-40 year old .
<user1> there are shelves and dishes . it appears to be a kitchen .
<user1> he is walking towards a door knob
<user1> he is fidgeting with stuff on a shelf .
<user1> stays in the living room , but walks from the coffee table to a shelf
<user1> he leaves for a second and grabs a chair and brings it back near the stove
<user1> the caption says he is in the laundry room so i think it is a washing machine .

<user1> no that 's pretty much that 's happening
<user1> he smiles at the camera when he puts the bottle down .
<user1> yes it looks very clean .

<user1> no the only sound is when he does a sneeze
<user1> yes she sitting the hold time
<user1> yes the floor looks clean
<user1> yes . it 's there throughout the video . don 't know what it is .

<user1> no he has it in his hands then places it on the top shelf of the closet .
<user1> no , but his hair is thinning in the front .
<user1> he smiles after finding the dish
<user1> no , he seems concerned about something , like he is checking something out .
<user1> then laughs at the end again after placing the medicine into the refrigerator .
<user1> the red thing on the floor is a cloth she picks up to wipe the picture frame before she starts hugging it .
<user1> for a few minutes then he puts it down .
<user1> no he just sets it beside him
<user1> i can hear the woman sneezing
<user1> a boy is sitting down at a kitchen table eating food
<user1> at the start of the video he is sitting on the edge of the tub with a towel on his lap .
<user1> it seems to me like some sandwich
<user1> no she didnt have any
<user1> i think it is a throw blanket .
<user1> when he is about done with the groceries he mistakenly knocks over a glass of water
<user1> it appears to be a garage actually in the video .
<user1> yes , he does sit down in a chair
<user1> no i think we 've covered it all
<user1> a little bit at the beginning .
<user1> she puts it in the glass
<user1> not sure light is on , it may be daytime
<user1> it looks like a small brush .
<user1> no , he looks pretty calm and expressionless .
<user1> it does not make a sound like that
<user1> the camera pans to the left and i see the man .
<user1> he is taking black bag and towel
<user1> this is most likely the kitchen from what i can tell .
<user1> there is someone talking and a bird squaking
<user1> i played it back ; all i could hear was dishes when she got up . she gets up at the very end and leaves the room
<user1> i think it is the living room .
<user1> yes . the man who isn 't putting food in a basket is squatting on the floor .
<user1> i can 't tell what type of food he has
<user1> no , it is already open .
<user1> yes , there 's a shelf by his left side filled with books \
<user1> no she is alone there
<user1> she seems to be showing the items to the camera , but not another person .
<user1> he drinks the entire glass of water .
<user1> yes thats right happening there
<user1> he never says anything at all
<user1> he adjusts his blanket at one point and rubs his nose
<user1> no they were concentrating on the one holding the vacumn
<user1> she seems to be telling him or supervising his actions
<user1> no , he was very quiet .
<user1> i can see a man , lets be fast
<user1> he puts it on top of some other stuff in the closet .
<user1> he almost looks like he has no teeth
<user1> it looks like a computer monitor with a tv show playing
<user1> he plays with his pants a little .
<user1> he puts them into the cabinet .
<user1> no she appears to be looking around last by the window
<user1> i cannot determine because it is kind of far .
<user1> he appears to be outdoors possibly at an apartment building .
<user1> a man opens the fridge .
<user1> i see a man and a small boy .
<user1> no once he has the blanket he carries it out of the room with him always holding it while the camera is rolling .

<user1> no , she does not sneeze or cough at all .
<user1> he appears to just be carrying the items and not using them
<user1> the walls are an off white color
<user1> i think this is outside , like a porch or patio .
<user1> it looks like it is gray
<user1> yes that is very true of the video .
<user1> she is silent other than giggling a little , then hanging up the cell phone .
<user1> i think he answers the other man 's voice .
<user1> no , when he comes into the room he is carrying a towel which he lays on the table .
<user1> yes , there is the sound of his movement , and the sound of him pouring something into the sink .
<user1> when he throws his backpack he misses the bench at the bottom of the stairs , so he walks over and picks it up
<user1> no they don 't talk to each other
<user1> yes at the end she starts to leave

<user1> he puts the note on his shoe and starts to drink out of the cup .
<user1> he turns the light out and walks out the door
<user1> yes he is sleeping in the beginning .
<user1> the person is sitting at a desk and typing on a laptop .
<user1> she looks into a messy wardrobe
<user1> yes he stays in this one room .
<user1> i can see a closed door , a table with a picture frame on it and a bed .
<user1> nothing else special , just him looking at his publication , reading and smiling .
<user1> i hear someone speaking in the background .
<user1> sounds more like a public speaking video .
<user1> no , she doesn 't say anything
<user1> no she sits up first to watch tv then the dog enters .
<user1> yes he is on the phone the whole time
<user1> there is only one woman
<user1> can 't see much of him because of lighting .
<user1> yes i can see only one
<user1> yes there is only the one man
<user1> he holds the towel against his face , smelling and snuggling it .

<user1> he is holding a cooffee cup
<user1> yes , he stays sitting the whole time .
<user1> yes , he keeps both shirts on .
<user1> there is no talking in the video .
<user1> i believe this is outside .
<user1> the woman does not do anything else .
<user1> no the whole video is in this room
<user1> i see he pulls out ice cream and eggs from the box .
<user1> she stays in that same position .
<user1> it might be , or maybe a textbook . i 'm not sure .
<user1> lets be fasy its a man
<user1> yes , first he takes off his shoes .
<user1> it takes place in a bedroom
<user1> yes he is a lone
<user1> yes , it is his shoes .
<user1> no , that is all the relevant information .
<user1> i think it is a bedroom , because of the dresser .
<user1> no she is already holding a bag in her hand . forgot to say that first time
<user1> the next thing the man does is put on his shoes .
<user1> no , he doesn 't say anything
<user1> he removes a laptop and quickly opens and shuts it .
<user1> he walks out a front door and shuts the door
<user1> she 's holding a cup and a cell phone .
<user1> no there is no one else .
<user1> no he does not have anything to eat .
<user1> he is the only one in the video
<user1> no , no other actions . however the man who is being photographed is sitting beside a tv .
<user1> it looks like a closet with all the clothes hanging on a bar .
<user1> yes there are windows in the video
<user1> he is actually knocking at the door .
<user1> at the beginning of the video he 's playing with a broom .
<user1> i really cannot tell what is in the tin
<user1> i have absolutely no clue . maybe telepathically .
<user1> she opens the book and is reading and writing something in it .
<user1> he closes the bedroom door .
<user1> no she did not talk but never stop to laugh all the way to the end
<user1> he was just standing and looking at the window
<user1> not really , maybe mid morning
<user1> yes they do seem to care
<user1> he walks toward the chair that is tipped and puts his arms up about half way in disbelief . he then chuckles laughing .
<user1> he turns on the washer , then picks up his cell phone
<user1> no you can hear someone in the background who is holding camera .
<user1> the man takes of his jacket as he is approaching the table .
<user1> he looks like he has nothing to be worried about ?
<user1> she never takes out what is inside the box
<user1> yes , he applies lotion to his arm .
<user1> i don 't think that is the case because he seems to be focused on what he is doing on the computer screen .
<user1> she is playing the game at the end
<user1> no , he seems indifferent and he just stares .
<user1> he actually doesn 't touch the glass he he picks up the can
<user1> she walks over the pantry with a bag of groceries .
<user1> no he doesn 't say anything but he laughs .
<user1> he never leaves the room
<user1> yes , he appears at the start of the video .
<user1> no but he gets it out of the oven which is weird
<user1> no , it is out of the frame of the video .
<user1> some kind of jar i guess
<user1> he first sneezes and then reaches back into the fridge and grabs a container and a soda
<user1> yes he is by himself
<user1> yes , she talks about opening and closing the box .
<user1> closes the blind that 's all
<user1> the other voice is a man .
<user1> she moved out of the camera when the video was about ending
<user1> he is barefoot at the start .
<user1> i do not think any
<user1> no he just picks it up off of the bed .
<user1> yes she did enter the house .
<user1> that is a cat sittting in the chair
<user1> no i cannot see in the pot .
<user1> in the beginning of the video , he picks up the box and pulls a shirt out of it .
<user1> no that is pretty much all that happens .
<user1> that 's all that happens in the vid .
<user1> im not sure why . but he still have another shirt
<user1> yes , like a big sheet curtain .
<user1> not really . they hold the camera , smile and press a few buttons on the camera . you hear a few clicks .
<user1> no but he is wearing a winter hat , so it must be cold in there .
<user1> it looks like a messy bedroom .
<user1> no but she pets the dog .
<user1> most likely is his underwear .
<user1> he is walking around the room chewing .
<user1> you can 't tell . the video shows what he does after , not before .
<user1> looks out the window and then runs into a corner of the room that the camera does not cover
<user1> i only seem him wrapped up in the blacket
<user1> i don 't think any books are around .
<user1> no table or chair that i can see .
<user1> yes , it is a man .

<user1> it looks like he 's just holding something but he puts it back
<user1> yes , he looks borderline obese .
<user1> the video stops once she walks past the camera .
<user1> she looks like she doesn 't mind and is used to it
<user1> he 's probably around 20-30 years old .
<user1> just one male in the video .
<user1> i was able to see him smile in the beginning parts of the video , by the washer .
<user1> i would guess she is young , but i cannot see her face .
<user1> no she does not at all .
<user1> yes the entire video takes place outside .

<user1> a woman standing in a doorway talking on a cell phone

<user1> at the end she walks out of shower after picking up pieces of ipod and she disappears .
<user1> no he does not speak
<user1> he sits in a chair watching tv the gets up with his hands in his pockets
<user1> i think he is playing music on it .
<user1> some sort of rag it appears to be
<user1> before she gives the noise of approval , he turns to smile at her , possibly asking for approval ? but there are no words between them .
<user1> just one young girl the entire time
<user1> i only see the one femalee .
<user1> it 's a white container , kind of like tupperware , or maybe a reused butter container .

<user1> no it was pretty uninteresting
<user1> there is a man sitting on a cabinet with a small towel on his shoulder
<user1> she holds it in her hand and keeps hold of it the entire time after picking it up .
<user1> a man walks into a kitchen , opens fridge , gets a water and sits down and drinks .
<user1> i would l say he 's in his twenties .
<user1> looks like it is a bed room
<user1> the man sitting holds the remote control .
<user1> he actually doesn 't have any expressions on his face
<user1> the woman laughs , but she does not talk .
<user1> no , then she feels curious about something happening outside . so she walks out the door with her laptop in her hand .

<user1> she only looks at the mug and the phone .
<user1> a man is standing in the doorway and starts sneezing .

<user1> he appears calm the entire video
<user1> it is a male in the video .
<user1> 1 person yes , and the dog

<user1> i think he 's looking at the window at first .
<user1> no , the only sounds you hear com from the tv ( until he turns it off ) and him moving around .
<user1> he is talking in a foreign language to the camera person .

<user1> he looks to be in a very content mood , and concentrating on his studies
<user1> not really except they are both being silly in front of the camera .
<user1> no she doesn 't sit down
<user1> i would guess they are in their mid 30s .
<user1> no there is no sound in the video
<user1> yes exactly that 's correct . that 's what is happening .
<user1> no , neither of the women get up .
<user1> yes , a man has facial hair in the video

<user1> looking in a mirror and fixing his clothes
<user1> yes she puts the pill bottle back .
<user1> it 's some kind of computer room or something . you can hear a machine in the background . maybe a printer .

<user1> she just puts on the one jacket
<user1> there is a bunch of junk of the table .
<user1> yes he is leaving the frame after .
<user1> no they move forward into the hall a bit .
<user1> she takes a drink from it , and then the video ends .

<user1> she reaches for a cup of coffee and takes a sip .

<user1> in the beginning , the girl is sitting holding a broom .
<user1> she does not have glasses .
<user1> it looks that way yes
<user1> there is just in the entire clip .
<user1> not worth mentioning for you
<user1> the walls look to be a yellowish color .

<user1> he puts the pillow back on top of the roof of the van and turns around .

<user1> no that is all he does .
<user1> no he is all ready sitting down in the video
<user1> based on the video , there is no way to know why he is smiling for sure . maybe he is excited about getting the bag of chips .
<user1> it starts with him sitting on the sofa and looking into a bag that 's in front of him .
<user1> he starts tidying up the room around the bed area with the broom in his hands .
<user1> it appears she is putting towels away .
<user1> it ends with the guy looking in the bag .

<user1> yes , there is just the one man , but i do hear voices in the background .
<user1> it looks like they are in a basement .

<user1> no , just the dog and her .
<user1> yes a plate with bread and what looks like a jar with peanut butter
<user1> she turns back to the camera and just stares at it for a long time while holding the items .

<user1> he was carrying them , but he put them down when he raised the blinds .
<user1> there is no music . you can hear the door squeak slightly as he closes it .
<user1> she seems uncomfortable and maybe in some pain .

<user1> she looks very young , like college .
<user1> nope , that is all that happens .
<user1> its pretty quiet no sound at all
<user1> not sure there are clothes hanging from the wall .
<user1> a blue long sleeve shirt probably button up and black pants
<user1> he walks out of an open door and it looks like he sneezes but there is no sound
<user1> the man is taking some medicine and the woman is video tapping him on her phone .
<user1> she is trying to look under the vacuum .
<user1> she seems pretty as she sits there typing on her laptop .
<user1> with man sneezing in black
<user1> no they are not drinking .
<user1> no i don 't think so .
<user1> no , but there is back ground noise .
<user1> he is not wearing a hat of any kind , but he is wearing glasses .
<user1> no , he is just sitting down throughout the end of the video '
<user1> a man walks in and has something in his hands . he ends up sitting down .
<user1> i am not sure , but i would guess no
<user1> there is no video audio
<user1> i can 't determine what 's on the deck , but i don 't think it ' a table .
<user1> he enters the room at the very beginning and heads towards the window .
<user1> no . he is doing it by himself . he drops the clothes somewhere .
<user1> he never touches the keyboard , he only claps with his hands a couple times near the beginning of the video .
<user1> no he is not putting food on a plate .
<user1> he walks to the doorway and picks up a backpack and a laptop and puts the laptop into the bag .
<user1> after that , he just sits there and looks at his phone
<user1> the lamp is on continuously once the bulbs are initially turned on .
<user1> just the bustling of bags and the pan on the stove
<user1> she begins to fill the mug with water .
<user1> no he stands in front of the bed
<user1> i don 't see a tv or window , but a sink
<user1> yes there is only man in the video having a phone conversation .
<user1> it looks like he is in the garage .
<user1> she flinches a bit when the box almost hits her in the head .
<user1> i don 't have any opinion of her .
<user1> no , she does not take anything out of wardrobe
<user1> i do not see any food or drink
<user1> it appears to be two boys
<user1> yes , he is taking off his clothes
<user1> he seems to be enjoying the show quite a bit and is pretty happy .
<user1> yes he is laying in bed
<user1> yes . it ends there after he walks out of the room where he dropped his phone .
<user1> yes , i would think after he turns out the light he is headed to bed
<user1> no i think we 've covered it
<user1> no . that is all that happens in this video .
<user1> there is a female that is laying on her stomach with her legs crossed in the air and she is holding her phone .
<user1> at the end he walks to the light switch and turns the light off .
<user1> no , that is pretty much it .
<user1> she checks the computer on the counter beside her

<user1> a faint buzzing sound is on the video .
<user1> yes , he walks away in the end .
<user1> there are not any pets
<user1> that is where the video ends
<user1> she places a second book back on the shelf after reading them and laughing .
<user1> mostly put on blanket around her should , then sit down on the toilet with the lid down for a few second .
<user1> yes , there are only two
<user1> i am not sure , he could be either
<user1> i can only see him from the chest up , but he seems to be sitting down . he takes a bite from a sandwich shortly after the video starts .
<user1> just the one man is in the video .
<user1> the caption says he sneezes but really he puts his finger on the side of his nose and sniffs .
<user1> he comes from the left of the screen .
<user1> they are a peachy-pink color
<user1> it is some kind of shed , full of stuff .
<user1> looks like boxes of art stuff
<user1> the man is in frame , there is another person holding the camera out of frame .
<user1> in the beginning he is in the bathroom taking off his jacket .
<user1> yes , she never get up .
<user1> yes , although her pants appear almost to be brown
<user1> nothing else , he just turns from the bookshelf to the couch .
<user1> she still kicking clothes around .

<user1> not really , he 's cleaning up .
<user1> that is the only item that she grabs out of the closet .
<user1> no , i cannot see any other rooms
<user1> yes , towards the end , he walks out of the bathroom .
<user1> no after he left the clothes on the desk , he began to run around the room .
<user1> the person was laying on the couch
<user1> she keeps sneezes into while holding it
<user1> he closes the open door as the camera follows
<user1> he pours a glass of wine then opens his shirt and laughs at his chest .
<user1> it seems to be a black plastic bag filled with something .
<user1> it 's hard to tell . it 's kind of magazine shapes , but more rigid . i think a paperback cook .
<user1> i can hear a television in the background
<user1> no , he tosses the sneaker on the floor .
<user1> thats the only food he touches . he also looks at the pot on the stove .
<user1> its looks like bedroom in the video
<user1> yes you got it , thats right
<user1> no . just a few of the clothes in the pile .
<user1> no , it looks like he was adjusting his clothing
<user1> no it doesn 't look like she had been in the shower
<user1> dark blue with some type of logo on it
<user1> a man is looking at a container of food .
<user1> he is standing in his living room at first and closing a window
<user1> yes it sounds like a television but nothing relevant to the video
<user1> no , i do not see a bookcase .
<user1> yes , you can hear clicking of her stirring and other little noises .
<user1> he 's holing a bottle of water and drinking it the whole time
<user1> it 's one lady in the clip
<user1> yes , the boy sets the dishes the man gives him down .
<user1> no he says nothing at all .
<user1> well not long after the video starts he runs down the hallway .
<user1> no he is standing in front of the toilet . then he takes his shirt off and grabs a box of detergent
<user1> a young man is standing inside an apartment with the door open .
<user1> i would imagine poor lighting .
<user1> he is alone the whole time .
<user1> he has no expression on his face
<user1> he was carrying a laptop .
<user1> he sits the whole time smiling trying to fix the window .
<user1> no , that 's about all that happens
<user1> i cannot really tell because he is fully under the covers
<user1> yes , it is a cup of water in her hand
<user1> i do not really know , she takes something out of the bag to add but i cannot see what it is
<user1> there is only one person in the video
<user1> he walks in holding the cookies
<user1> he puts then on the floor from what i can see and opens another pair of clean ones .
<user1> yes he does , when he is sitting .
<user1> he is already in there
<user1> the lady woke up in the dining room
<user1> the woman is walking down a hallway when the video begins .
<user1> yes the light was on
<user1> no there no pets in the video
<user1> the the two peole never speak
<user1> i 'd say so . he seems very comfortable . have a great day !
<user1> the scene ends with him standing at the wooden door with his hand around the doorknob .
<user1> no , pretty much the video is of him playing with drawer and leaving .
<user1> it looks like the woman is drinking soda .
<user1> he picks up the items with his hands .
<user1> no she all ready had lots of things in the closet
<user1> no , he never leaves the bathroom .
<user1> the man is early 30 s
<user1> at no time does a time appear .
<user1> no they do not return after .
<user1> the man is sitting in his chair the whole time
<user1> no , he does not leave .
<user1> yes i am sure that is an elaborate but very accurate description of what he does . i don 't think you know everything you need to know .
<user1> there is a white noise sort of sound . it sounds like the washing machine and / or dryer is running .
<user1> no he is not speaking english
<user1> puts empty soda container on top of fridgenot in , but yes that is what happens .
<user1> no she doesn 't do anything with the mop other than put cleaning fluid in it .
<user1> no he doesn 't ever do that

<user1> i cannot tell , it is facing the man
<user1> he should be cooking something
<user1> no there is no sound on the video
<user1> the mother is smiling , but not the daughter .
<user1> i 'd say he is a middle aged man .
<user1> it looks like it is possibly a bed room .
<user1> yes , just the one person .
<user1> he kind of walks off at the end
<user1> she moves a bit to reach the broom and drop it
<user1> the guy was the only one .
<user1> no he is running through the hallway
<user1> yes he is anxious to get away from the camera
<user1> no pictures of family in the video .

<user1> she manages to find what she is looking for and picks up a blanket .
<user1> maybe 14 at the oldest .
<user1> the man is lying in a bed
<user1> something sounds like it drops and then there is the clicking of the lamp and the sound of him hitting the couch as he falls
<user1> yes . he seems like he 's pleased , but he doesn 't laugh or anything .
<user1> no . the end comes after he drinks after he takes his medicine
<user1> he does not open the dryer
<user1> i think it is his house .
<user1> yes , there is a point in the video in which the angle of the camera abruptly changes as if the video is actually two separate edited a bit .
<user1> she is vacuuming the floor , yes .
<user1> no , just the rustling of the bag
<user1> she seems neutral or pleased during the video .
<user1> she is not , she is wiping her heels off with a towel .
<user1> yes , but they seem irrelevant . you can hear a child , presumably female toddler , in adjacent bedroom playing , and then knocking something over . woman ignores noises
<user1> he had it in his hand the whole time .
<user1> no there is no one else in the video
<user1> somewhere in their teenage years
<user1> he walks into the scene with them in his arms .
<user1> yes , that is how the video ends

<user1> yes a small bottle perhaps of medicine
<user1> no , she does nothing at all
<user1> he is chewing on some food
<user1> no he 's just digging through the closet the entire time .
<user1> he sets his shoes aside and then the video ends .
<user1> it looks like a bedroom
<user1> the man appears to be a rather large man and is wearing a hat
<user1> sound of laughter is what i heard
<user1> yes , there is music in the background
<user1> the dog is just laying on the floor wagging its tail .
<user1> she walks straight into the next room .
<user1> he already had his phone in his hand
<user1> no , but he appeared to have picked up something from the sofa .
<user1> yes he opens the refrigerator and uses the broom there
<user1> that is all he is doing in the video .
<user1> just background sound , no talking
<user1> yes , he speaks , but it is in a foreign language .
<user1> i cannot read his mind , it is apart of the script of the video
<user1> a woman walks into a bath room sipping water
<user1> he is in his living room .
<user1> nothing to else in this video
<user1> no he did not say anything .
<user1> he turns on the light when he enters .
<user1> he is about 17 years old .
<user1> no , he holds camera and then picks up towel and walks off camera .
<user1> in the beginning he has a book and a phone .
<user1> ah ... i am terrible at ages .. i would guess anywhere from 18 to 30 .. but again .. i am not good at telling that .
<user1> he doesnt seem to be typing .
<user1> yes he is sitting at the table the entire video .
<user1> the man has a mustache .
<user1> just him sneezing - - that 's it .
<user1> yes , there is some music coming from the television .
<user1> he just moves toward the camera at the end .
<user1> she stays in the entryway .
<user1> she walks over to the table and picks up a cup
<user1> no . we 've covered everything important i think .
<user1> the bathroom look very clean
<user1> she goes to the closet
<user1> no there is no sound
<user1> one man is in the video .
<user1> a man is looking at a glass .
<user1> he is holding a pillow .
<user1> yes he does laugh when he throw the towel down the stairs onto the chair .
<user1> he raises his head a little , but nothing else
<user1> no , it was just that sweater .
<user1> yes only one person with laptop in front of him on a small table
<user1> he makes a funny face toward the camera .
<user1> no he is not laughing or talking .
<user1> the action is taking place in the kitchen .
<user1> yes the video starts with a girl sleepping
<user1> i only see two people
<user1> yes that is how the video ends .
<user1> no i cant spot any animals at all
<user1> he had no expression on his face ,
<user1> it ends with him closing the book .
<user1> looks like he is getting dressed for a date .
<user1> he starts to take off his shirt and then the video stops
<user1> no . she just looks into the mirror . probably to check her appearance .
<user1> he continues to hold the blanket as he walks in the other room .
<user1> he is holding a camera
<user1> it appears to be some sort of stained glass window .
<user1> yes , there is sound in the video
<user1> no there is no audio
<user1> he removes things one by one
<user1> no he grabs a towel and wraps his waist with it
<user1> the room is full of clothes and pretty messy .
<user1> no in the start it 's empty she enters from the right side of the screen
<user1> the man takes off his hat then scratches his head .
<user1> i can 't tell from the distance .
<user1> the young boy who is filming does speak .
<user1> no , walks through a living room type room .
<user1> it looks like an old washing machine , so it 's not going to be quick .
<user1> she is in a stairway .
<user1> at the end she walks towards the camera , that 's it .
<user1> no he doesn 't talk yet
<user1> yes he use a blanket
<user1> a man is sitting and working on a laptop
<user1> he walks out of view and comes back with a plate
<user1> he 's carrying a book actually .
<user1> yes she leaves the room before the video ends
<user1> yes she puts it on a table
<user1> she is fixing a shelf at the top of the closet .
<user1> he mubles some stuff to himself as hes looking at the page in the book and he turns the page and laughs at that as well
<user1> they are in a bag
<user1> he does not take anything out of the fridge .
<user1> he stays seated the entire time
<user1> i think it 's a broom , but you can 't see what he 's sweeping .
<user1> walks in through a dooorway
<user1> it appears to be gray
<user1> he is laying on the floor checking his phone .
<user1> she is looking out of the open front door
<user1> it 's somewhat dark , but i 'm still not sure .
<user1> no he is there alone .
<user1> yes . she looks board but concern about her appearance .
<user1> no it is in the house
<user1> it is a bit weird that she was sleeping on a garage floor .
<user1> only one person is in it .
<user1> he maybe mid - 20s or so .
<user1> yes , he says hello then has a short conversation with someone on the phone .
<user1> no sound during the entire video
<user1> no talking in the video
<user1> he holds the bag the whole video .
<user1> i 'm not sure . seems he gets sidetracked when he find the old photos .
<user1> yes it looks like it is all in the same room
<user1> she begins at the doorway .
<user1> he is first sleeping on the bed . then gets up and turns on the light .
<user1> yes , the other guy takes a pill out of his backpack and drinks water with it
<user1> she looks to be in her 20s .
<user1> yes he is sleeping in the chair
<user1> the camera man is talking at the begininning
<user1> kind of deliberately slow like he is pacing .
<user1> this more likely a study room ..
<user1> i can see one chair in the room .
<user1> no , he doesn 't talk .
<user1> i 'm not sure but i believe he is about to take a bath .
<user1> no , she stands in the hall the entire time .
<user1> smiles when picking up the shoes and makes a strange face after taking " the shirt " out of the closet when putting it on . yes you have it .
<user1> no , never coughs or sneezes .
<user1> they are in the living room .
<user1> yes she 's the only person
<user1> no this person is outside , in the driveway in the beginning
<user1> hppy and wild and free
<user1> yes , he is sitting on the couch at the beginning .
<user1> there is only one guy in this video ?
<user1> when it starts she is mixing something in a pan .
<user1> he starts to walk with the plate but it ends as he is walking .
<user1> maybe a drama of some type , it 's in english
<user1> you see an older man talking on the phone in side the bathroom
<user1> yes , that is the summary of it .
<user1> the only person you see is the main man , but there is also the camera man and someone making noise .
<user1> i would say that depends on your taste
<user1> yes he walks up the stair case and then pulls a sandwhich out of a bag and eats it
<user1> he grabs the banana from the bed , but its hard to tell .
<user1> yes he is alone the whole time .
<user1> yes he stays on his sofa , seems like he is just relaxing .
<user1> the color of the stove is black
<user1> she is standing near the window eating crackers emotionless .
<user1> yes she does then moves it some around her bed in front of her .
<user1> yes on the table inside the house
<user1> no , no music is playing .
<user1> looks like a dorm or office
<user1> he is outside next to a building
<user1> i am not sure about that
<user1> she stands still nodding while on the phone
<user1> he walks in from another room into the bathroom
<user1> he looks like he might be in his 30s
<user1> nope , he just carries it and swings it back n forth as he sings
<user1> not before the broom . he later picks up a bottle of water .
<user1> no the vacuum was never turned on
<user1> yup that is right , that is what he is doing
<user1> it 's probably a bedroom but i can 't be sure .
<user1> no she does not take a drink .
<user1> yes he left and the dog follow him . the woman did not move .
<user1> no he doesn 't put the picture down at all .
<user1> it appears to be a laundry room .
<user1> he is looking through it , as if it is not working . it looks like a polaroid style .
<user1> no it is just the one man .
<user1> i think so . he 's sweeping the floor and she 's picking things up .
<user1> that is all that happened in the video .
<user1> he seems just thirsty in the video .
<user1> no . he goes into the room eating something out of the bag . then he skims through a book on the desk . then he picks up the book and takes it with him and leaves the room .
<user1> you can hear him jiggling the door but he is also laughing .
<user1> yes , he opens the door and walks in .
<user1> i am not sure , but you only see the two hindu guys . you do not see the cameraman
<user1> he just takes it and leaves
<user1> it is deep and calming .
<user1> it all happened so quick . she didn 't even flinch so im guessing it was a friendly grabbing of the phone
<user1> yes , she walks back out of the room .
<user1> just by the front door .
<user1> yes , he is also fixing a laptop
<user1> just the sound of his sandals hitting the floor .
<user1> she is all alone there
<user1> no music is heard in the video .
<user1> yes . the rug is pink .
<user1> he pulls the chair out and sits down
<user1> i can see him eating some of the chips .
<user1> no , he looks in the mirror through the whole thing .
<user1> no he shows no emotion at all .
<user1> there 's just one person in the room .
<user1> no one else is in the room .
<user1> it may as just well be , he seems proud of his cup .
<user1> i cannot see her face it is too dark
<user1> correct , there is two people in this video .
<user1> i can 't see the shelf so i don 't know if it did a good job
<user1> the video ends with him watching tv
<user1> nothing she continues to stand there talking .
<user1> no she just washes the mirror
<user1> initially he is talking then he grabs the vacuum from in front of him and begins to move . as he does this he starts to sneeze
<user1> this is a man in the video .
<user1> it looks like a living space . there is a door that is open that shows the outdoor .
<user1> she looks around from side to side
<user1> a t-shirt , ripped jeans and a leather vest over the shirt
<user1> she only grabs one pillow .
<user1> my watch is broken , no .
<user1> no , nobody seems to be sitting down in this video .
<user1> just the one girl in the video .
<user1> no , just that it is very awkward .
<user1> they seem to be in a large entrance way , or maybe a large room .
<user1> in the bathroom in front of the sink .
<user1> the room appears to be a kitchen .
<user1> she gets up and starts eating a sanwich in the bathroom
<user1> yes she is sitting the whole time
<user1> he does hold the book the whole time
<user1> he seems to be sitting on a bed .
<user1> the lone man in the video smokes and fiddles with a latch lock .
<user1> she puts down the bottle , as she sits on the bench , then puts the cigarette or pipe on top of the bottle , then the cig / pipe falls to the ground , she gets up , walks towards camera , and turns it off .
<user1> he picks up the paper plates . he alternates by picking up one off the couch , and one off the desk until they are all picked up .
<user1> no she walks back in front of the camera with her shoes and phone .
<user1> yes , it appears he does take one actual bite .
<user1> that should cover it all
<user1> she gets a broom and begins cleaning .
<user1> there is not any sound .
<user1> no she doesn 't say anything the whole video .
<user1> the guy laughs and then the lady laughs
<user1> nothing he said in the video
<user1> he grabs a small plastic table and is holding it upside down in the air .
<user1> he shakes as you can hear the sound of things on his collar . then jumps on the sofa and watches the lady with the broom .
<user1> its too dark to see
<user1> no i cannot hear anything .
<user1> this dude is smiling big time
<user1> his head is turned so i cannot see his expressions .
<user1> no on a washing machine
<user1> oh , she also throws the sandwich away before she fixes the water because i heard her throw it in the trash
<user1> no she does not eat or drink anything .
<user1> one does speak to the other but the noise makes it so i cant hear what is said .
<user1> yes , she puts many items away .
<user1> she does look very excited .
<user1> there are items around the kitchen and the bag of items on the floor .
<user1> yes , he did . there was a towel hanging on a round thing on the wall .
<user1> hard to say . he is holding the book and puts another shirt on . at the end is is looking at the cover . he may read it off video .
<user1> when the video starts , he is already there sitting . he doesn 't enter or exit the room
<user1> looks like he is at home in a dining room
<user1> they walk up to a mini fridge
<user1> he uses his broom to dust the contents of the dresser which are books .
<user1> the woman is eating snack from the beginning until the end of the video
<user1> she walks into a dining room maybe .
<user1> no , it is just the one man
<user1> nothing , it 's empty . but he puts it in the fridge
<user1> the man is doing something with a table
<user1> it looks like maybe groceries .
<user1> he goes back to dusting / sweeping after that but that is all .
<user1> no , only one man says something
<user1> yes , he is the only one .
<user1> i 'd guess just a red plastic bowl or pasta strainer
<user1> the video is 31 seconds
<user1> whatever the woman said convinced the boy he should leave .
<user1> no , it is turned to the person
<user1> yes when she is done sweeping she puts the broom back
<user1> no i dont think so
<user1> the guy undressing looks pretty happy
<user1> yes i see only one woman
<user1> she places the small bottle on a cloth table
<user1> no i can 't because they are talking in a foreign language i don 't know
<user1> at the very end , far from the camera
<user1> he opens a pantry / cupboard door .
<user1> yes he stands and takes something from his right pocket .
<user1> i don 't think so , he doesn 't react when he drinks it .
<user1> the video is about 40 seconds
<user1> after that , she gets up
<user1> there is nothing on the dishes
<user1> nothing else other than vacuuming the bedroom , throwing away the shoes and continuing vacuuming .
<user1> no there is only one woman in the video
<user1> no you cannot see waht he is watching
<user1> no , that pretty much covers it .
<user1> it appears to be a living room dining room combo
<user1> not shown in video why he is laughing
<user1> no she is standing when she puts them on
<user1> removes his gloves and walks to turn off the camera .
<user1> yes , it 's a laptop on the bed .
<user1> no , he stays there playing with the laptop
<user1> no he puts the bowl down but keeps the towel .
<user1> it looks day time but its a room so hard to tell
<user1> he did not take his clothes off .
<user1> i did not hear her speak , although the person taking the video speaks .
<user1> the man is speaking to someone off camera .
<user1> he picked up a bag of groceries , turned on the lights , and fixed his hair
<user1> yeah , he is turning on the camera and go to sit on the sofa
<user1> i hear some english words but then some words that are maybe foreign but i can 't tell because of his accent .
<user1> he is working on his computer and laughing .
<user1> there is one man in the video .
<user1> i cannot see the doorway .
<user1> that is not quite true . he actually put on his shoes .
<user1> the video is about 5 seconds long
<user1> he is in the living room .
<user1> at first he is playing with his phone
<user1> most of the video heis sweeping
<user1> i am almost 100 % sure this person is male
<user1> its too difficult to tell with the quality of video
<user1> finally he starts to clean the mirror with the towel
<user1> it looks like possibly a great room with dining and living room together .
<user1> no she leaves the closet after she pushes some hanging clothes to the end and kicks some stuff that is leaning on the floor .
<user1> yes , a television is playing in the background .
<user1> no the man does not say anything .
<user1> yes , the door was open at the start .
<user1> the only thing he holds is some papers he picks up
<user1> he walks out of the room
<user1> the video is quite long
<user1> just the noises of the person moving , no talking or anything
<user1> a man running around and a woman standing by the garage wall .
<user1> well first he is standing then he sits then he stands up again and then he walks to a laptop and starts messing with it .
<user1> no pretty much that is all you need to know
<user1> she drinks out of a cup
<user1> he sure does , except for one brief moment .
<user1> they take a picture of the table with their phone
<user1> it looks like a bedroom
<user1> they do not finish the sandwich .
<user1> there is nothing else going on
<user1> yes , a young guy comes down the stairs .
<user1> looks like it is probably lunch , a guy comes in and takes a plate with a sandwich
<user1> the man appears very old although in good shape
<user1> no , he picks the mirror up from one of the steps .
<user1> yes , she does look directly into the mirror during the video
<user1> she appears to be an older teen . maybe 16 to 18 .
<user1> he is writing some in a notebook
<user1> yes , he 's standding in the whole thing
<user1> he is just clicking on things with the mouse .
<user1> no he does not say anything
<user1> yes they are in the same room the entire time
<user1> he stayed there in the top of the stairs
<user1> lets be quick , yes he walks into the kitchen ?
<user1> yes , that is a clock on the wall .
<user1> yes , she picks up the folder and the stool she was sitting on and leaves the room fast
<user1> she sounds like she may get sick
<user1> it is a man sitting by himself
<user1> nothing he just had vacumm in hand left room
<user1> it is clutters with just about everything you could find in a kitchen .
<user1> no only one men i can see in room
<user1> lol , could be , but not sure about that .
<user1> cant see his expression at alli
<user1> no , he does not scratch his arm at all
<user1> i never see or hear anyone else .
<user1> nothing to start with , but then she turns and bends over and picks up a plastic bag .
<user1> it looks like a hall .
<user1> i think he is talking to himself in the mirror and laughing .
<user1> a woman walks in carrying groceries .
<user1> not unless you consider jumping dancing .
<user1> yes , he 's all ready there .
<user1> no , he doesn 't even put it on his ear . he 's just playing with it .
<user1> he is wrapped in a heavy duvet
<user1> i 'm honestly not quite sure .
<user1> he sneezes towards the floor , not towards the tv .
<user1> the other one comes later there
<user1> it appears to be an adult female
<user1> it starts with her sweeping in a hallway .
<user1> you cannot see the woman . only her voice is heard .
<user1> there is one woman visible .
<user1> she seems to want to try on a vest but never does
<user1> not during the video but the sandwich has a bite mark on it
<user1> none that i could discern .
<user1> he is holding the bottle at the start of the video .
<user1> he holds it in his hand the whole time taking bites out of it and sipping out of his mug
<user1> he starts smiling and walks towards the camera .
<user1> yes it is very clean
<user1> no , just move his feet a little bit when he is looking at his phone
<user1> no not all very quite
<user1> no i don 't see any chairs
<user1> yes , he is the only one shown
<user1> just the sound of the person getting into bed and interacting with her laptop
<user1> yes there are just two people
<user1> no pictures are seen on any wall
<user1> there is a man sitting in a chair watching tv .
<user1> yes , from the glare outside i would say it is sunny .
<user1> he poses with it and takes it with him when he leaves the room
<user1> no , he 's not talking at all .
<user1> no , he does not say anything
<user1> there are no pets in the video .
<user1> yes he is in the beginning
<user1> no , what i mentioned above is all that happens .

<user1> the whole time she is looking at her phone laughing and smile
<user1> he opens the closet , picks up a boxed table game , opens the box , and takes something out .
<user1> yes that is it inside this video .
<user1> yes , only the two women
<user1> no , it is just a video with a girl laying down and a girl sitting up , they are watching a video on a laptop and then it ends
<user1> she takes off her jacket .
<user1> i have no idea if it could be .
<user1> yes she is the only one there
<user1> he looked very cold . he is holding a pillow .
<user1> he takes a beverage out of a backpack and pours a drink and drinks it . then he straightens up the room while watching tv
<user1> he picks up a pillow at the end of the hall
<user1> yes the man does not move .
<user1> i am really not sure how the camera works but we have only one more q & a ! ! !
<user1> the bag is white and either navy blue or black
<user1> it may have a bit of water in it but it 's hard to tell even though later on she picks it up and takes a sip .
<user1> no , thats pretty much all he does .
<user1> yes , she stays standing on a box for the whole video
<user1> he 's still washing the sink .
<user1> no she never looks at the camera
<user1> he chewing on something that am not able to see
<user1> he did take the scarf off .
<user1> no , it 's white , probably a sandwich
<user1> looks like a living room , theres a couch .
<user1> i can 't really tell as the guy only mumbles a few words at times .
<user1> yes , in the door way .
<user1> no , she stands in the same spot , takes a couple sips , and looks aimlessly at the wall
<user1> probably it looks like that
<user1> no , she stands there the whole time with the coat / blankie in her left hand and her right hand hlolding the bread .
<user1> the taller man is carrying the plates .
<user1> no he did not say anything , only audio is the bottle shaking .
<user1> he walks out of view after he sets them down .
<user1> it looks like a shirt of some cort , he is haning it up in the closeet .
<user1> yes , just the one woman .
<user1> you can not see the floor at all .
<user1> no just the blanket . that 's all .
<user1> he exits the bedroom , not sure where he goes from there .
<user1> that is how the scene ends .
<user1> if i had to guess i would say that she is into her fifties .
<user1> they are speaking a foreign language
<user1> there 's no talking in the video although he does laugh at one point
<user1> no . i can 't see what makes her do this .
<user1> he sneezes into the towel 3 times , he is not happy , he then picks up a cup , pours water out of the cup into the sink and puts the cup back where it was , that 's it
<user1> 2 people are in the video
<user1> no , i can 't tell at all .
<user1> it must be south asian music .
<user1> yes , she is standing in the kitchen in front of refrigerator .
<user1> he does get up and leave the room
<user1> a man is seated near a counter .
<user1> yes that is correct in the video
<user1> she is sweeping the floor .
<user1> no that is all that happens .
<user1> yes it looks like a hallway .
<user1> she hugs it and then puts it in a cabinet
<user1> i only see one but i can hear someone else speaking also
<user1> no he is all alone .
<user1> no she never takes anything out of the box
<user1> there is only the usual background noise
<user1> i 'd say she 's early to mid 20s maybe . a young woman .
<user1> yes , there is a tv playing .
<user1> it really is hard to say what is going on with the tv .
<user1> he 's smiling while working on a laptop in the beginning .
<user1> you never see what 's inside .
<user1> i believe she does get it
<user1> she walks down the hall after throwing the pillow there
<user1> yes , it seems to be .
<user1> i didn 't see any , but he possibly could have .
<user1> he walks over to some dishes on the floor .
<user1> we hear no talking in the video .
<user1> he carries it up until the end of the video and he walks off cam .
<user1> there is what sounds like indian music playing
<user1> he put the sneakers in the closet .
<user1> no she is watching tv and wearing shoes and laughing and also biting food
<user1> there are 2 people in it
<user1> the person comes from the hallway and enters the bathroom at the start of the video .
<user1> he takes something out but i can 't see what it is because he then goes back to sneezing and cleaning his ears .
<user1> i think he is sober
<user1> no , a part of a stoop to the outside but that is it .
<user1> he does not speak or make any noise , he just smailes when he lifts his head .
<user1> yes , just one person
<user1> he walks away but than the video ends .
<user1> i cant really tell , maybe a tv room but there is a computer in it .
<user1> no one else is in the video .
<user1> no . no one is visible .. but i think someone is holding a camera .. and it seems like a sort of public ( ish ) place .
<user1> no there are no pets
<user1> nope , it ends after he turns out the light .
<user1> it runs about 34 seconds
<user1> it 's hard to see specifically without a closeup of the shelves .
<user1> no , we have covered all of the significant events in the video .
<user1> i can 't really see what 's in it .
<user1> i can see only one woman .
<user1> he is sitting in the beginning
<user1> it looks like the bathroom
<user1> no , just looks out the window with the shoes in his hand and laughs .
<user1> hard to tell , the video doesn 't show that
<user1> he folded towles and got call
<user1> hard to say due to facial hair , early 20s perhaps .
<user1> im not sure but the pot is steaming .

<user1> the channel remains the same
<user1> i honestly don 't know what you need to know .

<user1> there is sound , but the only thing you really hear is the sound of the bag hitting the floor .

<user1> it looks to be some type of awning in front of another part of the room . it 's really a plain decorative touch .
<user1> no he didt leave the room
<user1> it is weird . she has a cloth and wipes the floor by the bed . then she lifts up the rug and gets a sandal from under the bed . i have no idea why she wipes the floor .
<user1> no he does not wash his hands
<user1> it seems to be a one-room apartment
<user1> yes she is the only one during the whole clip . she is sitting in a chair with her book taking a picture of herself .
<user1> looking out the window and then laughs .
<user1> he pulls the pillow out of the box and lays it to the side .

<user1> he is sitting on the bed eating a sandwich
<user1> no , he just looks at it briefly .
<user1> he is the only person .

<user1> i can see only one
<user1> it moves further right to a man sitting in a chair holding a pillow
<user1> just thru the mirror when he wipes his tears . kinda dark and hard to see .
<user1> one person most of the time , but for a split second you can see a second outside a open door .
<user1> looks like a day time but not clear in the video
<user1> no that is about it .
<user1> that is all he does , walks into the other room sits down and holds the bag .

<user1> she is sitting in a chair .
<user1> a laundry room , most likely .
<user1> about as happy as anyone can be redaing instructions

<user1> the person filming with his camera appears to be young , maybe 20 .
<user1> he has a cardboard box
<user1> no , she does not pretend to take a bite
<user1> it looks like a study room or a bedroom but i 'm not sure .
<user1> he sits in the same spot the entire time
<user1> i can 't really tell what is on the table .
<user1> it never does , it just sort of moves about behind him sniffing .

<user1> the computer is on but she doesn 't use it .
<user1> he comes through a door after the video begins .
<user1> yes . that 's pretty much it . the stool seems really light , like a child could pick it up , but they slide it together slowly .
<user1> the clip starts with showing the desk with the computer , and a person entering the room .
<user1> has a slight yellow tint to it . i 'm afraid to guess .
<user1> he plays on his computer and he wipes his hand on his right leg after eating something greasy looking .
<user1> just static type noises , he looks like he laughs at the end .

<user1> no , i can just see him standing in front of the sink .
<user1> no , searching through the cupboard is all he does
<user1> i don 't hear much sound in the background , just normal noise .

<user1> yes the rooms are clean .
<user1> the man then gets up and goes over to his dresser and gets some medicine to take

<user1> it looks like he 's moving dust around , maybe , but the floor is cluttered and he does not have a dustbin .
<user1> it is a clear glass .
<user1> he later picks up a vacuum cleaner and you hear him pick it up and put it down .
<user1> yes it seems as if he is taking a picture with the item in his hand trying to find the right pose .
<user1> he put the vacumm down and took a bite
<user1> the room in the video looks like a dining room .

<user1> a guy picks up a book and a mirror and laughs into the mirror .
<user1> he appears to have a pen and is writing in a notebook .
<user1> the only sound is the door opening and the man putting the dishes into the sink

<user1> he does walk into the room .
<user1> she is just looking at herself till the man starts talking to her .

<user1> he just sits there looking at his phone

<user1> i can hear his feet padding across the floor as he hurries into the bathroom , and some other background noise i can 't identify .
<user1> yes but a little background noise
<user1> after she clicks the light switch she exits the way she came .
<user1> no he is in room from start .
<user1> i think she probably came back from running and trying out the shoes . she is probably going to send them back and used the computer to look up the address
<user1> it looks like a pack of cookies .
<user1> he is just standing on
<user1> i dont see a drink by her .
<user1> he just glances at it . he keeps ahold of it though .
<user1> she takes a drink , sets the mug on the table . takes a couple bites of food and sets the plate down . thats it .
<user1> she is going to open the fridge .
<user1> it seems bit messy from my viewpoint .
<user1> he sneeze a seven times lot of dust
<user1> no that is all he did in the video
<user1> the man who entered just stands there and glances up once at the other . nothing else .
<user1> no face that i can see . always facing back .

<user1> it is a very dark room . hard to tell . maybe a bedroom of some sort .
<user1> no i can 't hear him talking

<user1> he is sitting at laptop then looks to the left side of screen . he spots a dsi and picks it up .

<user1> yes , its pretty cluttered in the kitchen
<user1> he appears to be late 30 ' s but hard to tell
<user1> it looks like a blog page with a picture of a dish , maybe steak and veggies .

<user1> it 's hard to tell , but it may be a bedroom .
<user1> yes he is an adult male
<user1> he does not say anything throughout the video .

<user1> i can 't tell that at all
<user1> just the sound from the pill bottle ratteling and like car noises in the distance

<user1> he may have been but it was hard to tell .
<user1> i see one child running in back for a second , who doesn 't speak .
<user1> it looks to be a living room or play room .
<user1> it is the one angle .
<user1> the dog wants attention and to be patted i believe
<user1> just one person is in the video .
<user1> there are a lot of bottles and things on the counter , i 'm sure they are beauty products
<user1> he is laying back the whole time .

<user1> he puts the shoes beside him
<user1> no , only the pillow and step ladder .

<user1> can 't see what kind of book , but he opens it before he picks up a coffee cup .
<user1> it looks like day light there
<user1> then he falls to the floor .

<user1> halfway of it could be a window
<user1> no that is all that happened

<user1> i don 't see any pictures , no
<user1> no just that he is listening to music in another language .
<user1> he is looking at his phone for quite a long time

<user1> he looks like a young white guy with brown hair .
<user1> no she is not , another language .
<user1> no , he takes a long time chewing though , and the sandwich is on top of a small stack of dishes .
<user1> a man standing by the counter cleans up the kitchen and takes a drink
<user1> white tank top and black bottoms .
<user1> the girl rinses a glass with water .
<user1> some using cloths like shirt and jeans
<user1> there is a hot plate of sorts .
<user1> yes , that 's all she did .
<user1> thats all he did in the clip
<user1> just appears to be watching what is going on outside the window
<user1> no the way she is holding it , it is hard to tell .
<user1> he looks it at at the beginning then puts it in his pocket
<user1> he seems to be a diy , not a repair guy .
<user1> no i didn 't even notice the dog
<user1> first the man pulls out a chair and sits on it .
<user1> i think it is the door to the garage . i think she comes in from the garage and then gets the other bag from the same doorway .
<user1> i can hear the vacuum running .
<user1> he sits forward in the chair and stares forward
<user1> no , i cannot really tell based on the video
<user1> no , you cannot see anyone else in the video .
<user1> no she never walks out . she takes 2 steps closer to the camera at the very end .
<user1> he does not touch the computer
<user1> i would guess he is happy .
<user1> no but it looks like there might be a tea kettle
<user1> there is a light on above his head .
<user1> it was on the floor close to the cabinet .
<user1> yeah , the lighting seems to be pretty bright for a living space .
<user1> yes , she is wearing glasses .
<user1> no as soon as he picks up the camera he stops recording .
<user1> about 30 seconds is the video
<user1> he leaves the room after picking up a few things from a chair .

<user1> no , she 's not cooking anything .
<user1> she is the only one in the video .
<user1> yes , there is only one person .

<user1> just one no one else appears
<user1> well they do sweep the floor before the video ends .
<user1> no just drinks coffee and puts it back down .
<user1> no but he looks dressed like a teacher and it looks like a cafeteria or classroom
<user1> no i do not see windows .
<user1> he is not holding anything , he is standing there and shifting his positions like he is restless , he has a towel on his shoulder
<user1> he is holding some book
<user1> he seems to be in the bed room .
<user1> the man looks like he is possibly intoxicated or disoriented
<user1> yes it is a man in the video . he throws a box of something in the closet , gets a picture and leaves the room
<user1> no , he does not exit .
<user1> the girl is smiling at some food she is eating and watching tv . the guy enters and pours a drink in a glass at a cabinet
<user1> no , i cannot ; i would assume morning , but that 's a wild guess out of two options ..
<user1> it 's a hallway outside the bedroom i think
<user1> i don 't see any emotions on his face . he is focusing on what he is doing .
<user1> yes she looks very happy
<user1> yes , the video ends with her leaving the screen
<user1> he 's using some kind of article of clothing or blanket to hit a chair .
<user1> he 's vacuuming the floor in the video
<user1> he reaches down to pick up the red bowl .
<user1> yes . he put the groceries in the fridge and close it before getting the beverage
<user1> yes the room is not the cleanest room in the world .
<user1> she comes in from the left but i am not sure what room that was .
<user1> the room is fairly messy . looks like there 's clutter everywhere .
<user1> the guy is sweeping the floor and he picks up something on the shelf and then stops to eat his sandwhich
<user1> i cant tell . its in a brown box
<user1> more like neutral the smile was forced
<user1> various laundry and cleaning supplies .
<user1> i believe she woke him up
<user1> those clothes need to be washed .
<user1> he leaves the room after he puts his shoes on
<user1> it 's a box in his hand
<user1> he left it on the blanket .
<user1> no i just hear someone doing dishes and a dog was barking but i did not see it
<user1> he is sitting in a chair reading out of a book and taking notes
<user1> she seems to be looking at something on her phone .

<user1> yes they are both in a bathroom
<user1> she just holding them in video
<user1> they never get up off of the floor .
<user1> it ends with him looking around . almost like he is trying to see if anyone saw what he did .
<user1> no he does not sit
<user1> no just the girl standing there and and the boy walking by
<user1> no one else is present in the video
<user1> yes , that is what happens at the start of the video .

<user1> no one is outside , one person is inside .
<user1> he looks to be in his late 30s possibly .

<user1> yes , and then he quickly runs out of the kitchen
<user1> no , there are two people in the video .
<user1> no just the one window
<user1> she 's opening up a thermos .
<user1> at the beginning he was barefoot . then he started putting on his shoes in the mid flight .
<user1> no the door does not open .
<user1> i would guess happy . he has a weird blank look on his face most of the time he is looking at the camera .
<user1> yes that is how the video starts
<user1> the first boy begins to walk outside , but then begins to sneeze . we never see the boy actually go outside .
<user1> 31 seconds is all that it was

<user1> the woman appears first lighting the fire .
<user1> no , i do not see a smile on his face .
<user1> no she does not speak .
<user1> he leaves the room and that is all i can see
<user1> he is holding blanket then left
<user1> not much just mushing some lucky charms .
<user1> there are no voices just movement sounds if that makes sense
<user1> he seems pretty neutral . - neither happy nor mad
<user1> i did not see the woman i only hear her voice
<user1> yes , there is sound on the video .
<user1> he looks sleepy and kind of depressed

<user1> not sure , he was come to other room
<user1> he walked in and sat down .

<user1> no he is not eating anything
<user1> it is just one male
<user1> no , he never closes the machine .
<user1> the top is not clear it has a color .
<user1> he seems kinda bland and no expression .
<user1> it 's not clear . this could be a small living room with storage or pantry .
<user1> yes , at the end she leaves the bathroom .
<user1> there is a fridge in there and lots of fruit so it is some kind of a kitchen area .
<user1> the one end is not real wide but i cant tell how long it is .
<user1> he goes into a room
<user1> just some noise when he put down the laptop
<user1> he is moving in the kitchen
<user1> the camera person moves the camera and the woman is out of the shot
<user1> it looks like sheets or blankets
<user1> no he does not grab anything .
<user1> i 'm not sure , you can hear some motion of rubbing
<user1> no he does not pick anything up .
<user1> yes he is the only one .
<user1> there 's just one person in the video
<user1> well it 's in a coffee mug so i assume coffee .
<user1> no , there 's nobody else present .
<user1> she walks into the bathroom .
<user1> no , once she throws the papers on the floor the video ends there .
<user1> i have no idea but the whole time he is in front of a mirror .
<user1> only one room in the video
<user1> she also took the mug with her that she brought in the first place .
<user1> there are two people in the scene .
<user1> it just has things stored in it but is organized .

<user1> it is about 34 seconds long and nothing much happens in it .
<user1> it looks quite large , yes .
<user1> no , nothing was picked up .
<user1> he looks to be caucasion

<user1> there is only one guy in a blue tshirt .
<user1> about three times in the video

<user1> yes , he 's asleep in a chair .
<user1> after he is done , he leaves the room .
<user1> i would say in his mid 30s or maybe younger .
<user1> there are no animals in the video .

<user1> the room likes possibly a dining room .
<user1> white with some kind of print on it
<user1> no , i do not not see anyone else .
<user1> she is in a living room , rec room type of area .

<user1> no problem , he was just neutral
<user1> i couldn 't see , it was dark
<user1> he is in the room and at the beginning of the video , he is reaching into the closet and pulling out what appears to be a shirt .
<user1> that 's when he grabbed the pitcher of water .
<user1> he eats some type of sandwich and drinks from a plastic cup
<user1> yes , i can hear , but i don ` t understand what they are saying .
<user1> that is all you need to know .
<user1> i am not sure , it is in a foreign language
<user1> he is very lightly touching things with the broom not really a full on sweep .
<user1> yes they were indian or asian
<user1> yes i can hear the sounds
<user1> something i can 't really see clearly it just had some white screen

<user1> yes , i can see carpet .
<user1> no they were silent the whole time
<user1> he does not take anything from the bathroom with him when he leaves .
<user1> yes , not much happening - other than cooking .
<user1> no this man continues to hold it
<user1> yes first he takes a bite of the sandwich and then a sip of water
<user1> yes , in frame . but another is holding the camera .
<user1> it is a man in the video .
<user1> no it was not in a container .
<user1> a little bit of noise comes from the man .
<user1> that is correct assuming you are referring to shirt colors .
<user1> she is playing with phone
<user1> he is in the bedroom
<user1> the camera is stationary throughout .
<user1> he closed the laptop first and then did something else .
<user1> no , you got it down perfect .
<user1> she 's eating the food in the beginning
<user1> it looks like she is outside on the stairs .
<user1> yes . i don 't hear or see anyone else .
<user1> no . she is just fidgeting with the rag , looking at the wall , walking up the stairs and then down again
<user1> no , i don 't think so .
<user1> no there is nothing else going on .
<user1> you could call it that , yes
<user1> he is sitting next to a vacuum while looking at his phone .
<user1> it is some documentary about the planet earth
<user1> no just his fingers on hair
<user1> yes and you hear her laughing as a reaction to what someone out of the video says .
<user1> i personally do not see one .
<user1> he throws the book down on the counter top as if he is angry .
<user1> my best guess would be is that he is confused of some sort , he appears to be looking for something with the granola box .
<user1> no he just moves stuff and wipes the table .
<user1> the dog runs in and jumps on the bed
<user1> no he is the only one .

<user1> yes , sneezing , table sounds can be heard .
<user1> after he pours the water , he opens the vitamins .
<user1> i think he is cleaning but he does it by hitting the rage on the table .
<user1> the man is doing what appears to be homework while they are watching tv , then he sneezes and the woman comforts him by stroking his head
<user1> she sneezes twice and says a few words on the phone .
<user1> he is holding some kind of food
<user1> just one person is here

<user1> yes , she is holding a camera .
<user1> no i do not see any change of expression .
<user1> he went into another room .
<user1> no that was all that happened
<user1> he may be in his 30s .
<user1> she is still eating and he is still taking pictures of himself putting his shoes on .
<user1> not when he pulled them out but they could have been in the bag .
<user1> after the man begins to walk away .
<user1> i can 't tell , he is standing in one spot . the whole time .
<user1> no i do not think so

<user1> there is no pet in this video .
<user1> the video begins with a woman standing over her counter she appears to be cooking .
<user1> he has a bandana on his head .
<user1> not a thing more than eat cookies and look out the window .
<user1> there is just one person , a woman , in the video .
<user1> he opened the fridge and took a sandwich
<user1> one person is in the video
<user1> yes he is using the phone the entire time .

<user1> yes that is correct the video ends with her taking them outside .
<user1> only of him laughing out loud .
<user1> no , but the guy tossed the apple in the air .

<user1> he then gets up from the chair and starts walking in the direction that he entered . the scene ends before he gets out of view .
<user1> i can 't see in detail , but they are all colorful .
<user1> after she takes it out of the cabinet she sits it on the counter for a second then picks it up and walks toward the camera .
<user1> it is hard to tell , either a cell phone or remote to the tv .
<user1> the tv is muted and he never unmutes it .
<user1> now . he picks up the pillow and twirls it over his head with one hand . it is odd .
<user1> a woman walks into the laundry room , takes off her jacket and throws it on top of the dryer .
<user1> she closes the cabinet door and moves out of frame
<user1> yes there are two suree
<user1> he does not speak on the phone .

<user1> the boy leaves the hallway ( the red bench they sit on is in a hallway ) and he comes back and gives the towel to the man and sits again .
<user1> they appear to be black sneakers
<user1> she gets up and walks towards the camera and leaves the room .
<user1> yes the hallway is empty

<user1> she is sitting on a bed or sofa and watching something on her laptop with clothes in her hand .
<user1> no , he sits at the desk / table , eats cookies and repeatedly opens the curtain to look out the window .

<user1> he then walks in to the house
<user1> that is how the video ends .

<user1> yes there is a refrigerator in the back
<user1> no , this sums up everything

<user1> he smiles at a picture that he 's holding
<user1> a man is sitting on a bed with a phone to his ear , smiling and nodding .
<user1> he is standing in the doorway , drinking coffee and holding a sandwich .
<user1> there is no television that i can see , and since he just awoke i doubt it .
<user1> might be the entrance to his living room

<user1> i cannot see what is written .
<user1> appears to be an intro to a show
<user1> he stands pretty still , he only moves when he enters and exits the bathroom
<user1> she starts the video out holding some toilet paper .
<user1> i 'll guess and say that he is in his thirties .
<user1> it ends after the picture taking
<user1> after tidying the desk , he walks over to a mirror and starts cleaning it with a cloth that he has over his shoulder .
<user1> they appear to be white
<user1> i cant tell whats in the box on the floor

<user1> you can see the sun coming through
<user1> no he never comes back
<user1> he props himself up and grabs a packet from the nightstand . he tears it open with his teeth , and it looks like a cookie falls on the floor . he picks it up and eats it .
<user1> i think it is probably a bedroom .
<user1> i know it 's cartoons . not sure what though .
<user1> she sneezes twice into a towel

<user1> he is in the bedroom .
<user1> i already told you so
<user1> it 's hard to tell , but it just looks like he is looking , maybe scrolling
<user1> she is sitting on a step on stairs ?
<user1> she walks toward the door awkwardly .
<user1> you can hear the sound of the sweeping
<user1> yes , all that stuff is on the floor .
<user1> the only noise you hear is the swish of him taking the jackets off .

<user1> no she has it in her hand .
<user1> the video begins with the girl turning on the camera and then walking over to sit on the couch .
<user1> i can 't tell but it looks like it would hold a soap bar .
<user1> we 've covered mostly everything in the vid
<user1> the boy standing continues to sweep while the other lays down on the cushion .
<user1> no food not drink in shot
<user1> the guy is in a laundry room .
<user1> right up until the man starts walking toward the door
<user1> a man is running towards the door with a tv on the ground .
<user1> it doesn 't seem like they are , she 's just watching him with the camera .
<user1> probably in his thirties or forties .
<user1> the only thing ever in her hands is the pillow .
<user1> he took a towel and sneezed and took a book and read it .
<user1> they kind of snuggle and look at a phone
<user1> yes , it is daytime outside
<user1> he is sitting on the floor at the start of the video .
<user1> it looks like a dining room
<user1> she could be in the living room
<user1> i can 't tell what time of day it is .
<user1> i hear no sound at all
<user1> no he does not carry it down the stairs
<user1> he is looking at a few photos one at a time
<user1> that sums it up just about right .
<user1> yes , she is in a bedroom .
<user1> no it just sounds like casual talking .
<user1> yes , he 's at it for about 15 seconds .
<user1> it could be their home but it also reminds me of a hair salon because there are lots of chairs and a sink nearby .
<user1> no there are no pets that i saw .
<user1> they had a cup in hand but did not dirnk anything
<user1> i see one man and one woman
<user1> the video ends with him laughing

<user1> the room is empty to start , a woman walks in from the side , holding a chair .
<user1> no they do not say a thing
<user1> he tries to fix the handle or something and the video ends
<user1> it looks like three times .
<user1> he continues to look at his book .
<user1> the guy in blue says something but the other guy never answers .
<user1> just him , and it appears the camera is set
<user1> no that is all he does the whole time .
<user1> probably not . the video just focuses on the coffee at the end
<user1> it does not look to be that clean
<user1> no , there is no talking .
<user1> no one is talking in the video
<user1> i can 't see whats on the plate . just the bottom of it when he stands up
<user1> there are two people in the video .

<user1> it begins with a man picking up a banana and start to eat it .
<user1> there is a tiny amount of talking
<user1> he touches the cord with this right hand and the vacuum cleaner with his left hand .
<user1> yes she is the only one
<user1> it could certainly use some tidying up
<user1> next she gets the door open picks the broom back up and walks outside .
<user1> the man puts sandwiches in a bag and puts them in the closet . he then laughs manically .
<user1> it was a box full of clothes , like he was sorting through it
<user1> yes it is based in a bedroom , it starts with the man going over to the closet and opening it

<user1> i just saw dirt swept up which wasn 't very visible .
<user1> he walks towards the back .
<user1> there is some background noise in the video .

<user1> no , he doesn 't speak at all .
<user1> a person sets a box on the table
<user1> he is sweeping then he grabs a small towel from the counter and wipes the front of the cabinets .
<user1> i 'd say he 's 20 years old
<user1> no he never eats anything .
<user1> yes he sounds happy but i cannot see the face .
<user1> he keeps turning it over and it appears he is trying to figure out how to open it .
<user1> he stands and goes to the window
<user1> he is sitting on the top step
<user1> i dont think so so
<user1> no , the man is sleeping .
<user1> i cannot tell what detergent she uses
<user1> a guy rushed in entering the room and turned on the tv , maybe anticipating on something he did not want to miss .

<user1> yes he does look in the mirror .
<user1> he is wearing casual clothes
<user1> for most of the video , yes he is .
<user1> there are two people and one in the background

<user1> i can see only one
<user1> no she is not doing that

<user1> he is moving slow pretty much
<user1> no it is just her in the room .
<user1> the whole scene she stands in one position holding a coffee cup and her other hand is holding a door knob
<user1> i think that is a plastic bag he 's squeezing
<user1> at the end of the video
<user1> yes , one man here in the clip
<user1> she does indeed do that .
<user1> i think its keys or medicine
<user1> he plastic bag says fashion on it so i don 't know where that is

<user1> not sure but , he getting some pickle
<user1> no i could not tell what was in the bag .
<user1> no she just walks to the table very slowly .

<user1> she looks at the camera
<user1> she starts putting things away and then she starts to vacumm in there .

<user1> just a long screw driver .
<user1> no she is not smiling at all

<user1> the clip ends , we 'll never know sadly
<user1> no i only see the ceiling
<user1> it looks like a beach towel or a blanket
<user1> no , i don 't see any pets .
<user1> yes correct this is what happened
<user1> she appears to be caucasian
<user1> no , they stay at the bottom of the stairs .
<user1> no , he doesn 't seem to be angry
<user1> no , just looks at it .
<user1> yes she does it is a clear liquid that she poors out of a blue bottle into a clear cup .
<user1> no the camera does not move .
<user1> it 's a woman . she goes over to the patio door and fumbles with the blinds . then she removes a pillow from the couch and tosses it and stands on the couch and fumbles with the blinds some more
<user1> there is just one man
<user1> it looks to be a living room .
<user1> it is a dark colored plate . sort of hard to tell because the lighting is so dim .
<user1> seems like kitchen as the fridge can be seen in the background
<user1> the room looks to be pretty tidy .
<user1> yes , he turned it off so he could separate the pillow from the vacuum .
<user1> no , there 's a kitchen & another room in the background though .
<user1> first she fixes the shower curtain , then straightens up the stuff on a shelf , then closes the window and then uses a rag to clean the door .
<user1> it looks like a recent video , but is taller rather than wide , like taken with a phone .
<user1> the girl is sitting there in what appears to be an office / home office
<user1> the guy on the bed with a notebook
<user1> i don 't see a reflection of a chair in the mirror .
<user1> looks like a living room
<user1> well he then grabs some shoes from the landing of the stairs .
<user1> shows the man entering akitchen .
<user1> yes it was only one time .
<user1> i she sneezes two times
<user1> no , it looks like she is flipping through her notebook looking through her notes
<user1> one person walks into the room at the beginning and the other person is already seated at the table .
<user1> she stays in the kitchen the whole time
<user1> he is washing clothes with detergent
<user1> why yes she does start to sweep
<user1> he was very aware of the camera
<user1> no , not really , i described all the events .
<user1> i do not see anything else
<user1> there is only the one man .
<user1> he grabs a box and leave the bedroom . thats how the video ends

<user1> there is only one person in the video
<user1> no , she never interacts with a cabinet
<user1> yes , i can hear the sound .
<user1> no she takes her shoes off and sits down while laughing .
<user1> he does not say anything .
<user1> no he did not pour anything into the cup
<user1> one of the men is
<user1> just one person in the video .
<user1> yes you can hear the water pouring into the cup
<user1> he is snuggling the pillow while smiling and sitting in the chair .
<user1> yes , she is stirring something .
<user1> at the end she gets up and turns of the camera .
<user1> no , the is no sound in the video .
<user1> not really , it may be some type of bread .
<user1> yes , there is only one person .
<user1> in some kind of room .
<user1> he doesn 't seem to have much of a reaction . he picks up the laptop and turns around before you see him really look at the screen .
<user1> it is definitely day time
<user1> there are just ambient sounds , no talking .
<user1> that is how it ends , he turns off camera .
<user1> the room , either the carpet is dirty or the cement floor is dirty
<user1> he takes a picture of the box .
<user1> it 's either a living room or a bedroom . not sure .
<user1> he is on the stairs in the video
<user1> in their 40s it appears
<user1> no , nothing else is really interesting .
<user1> he is wearing a vest over a tunic and pants .
<user1> before that , he stands up to pick up a bag off of the floor .
<user1> it looks like some type of electric saw
<user1> no , they were already folded so she just put them in there and shut it
<user1> there are two people in the video .
<user1> you have every bit of information that i can provide .
<user1> no , he just walks out normally
<user1> he never leaves . the bag seems a bit top heavy , it is very full .
<user1> i 'm not sure they arent actually doing anything but laughing
<user1> he holds up the blue pillow he was holding in his other hand
<user1> i can not see good her face its in a distance , but i guess it seems neutral
<user1> no he does not cover his sneezes .
<user1> just the person recording her
<user1> there is sound but nothing is audible
<user1> i do not see any
<user1> no some other guy came in the room and poured something in the cup
<user1> yes , it is a kitchen .
<user1> yes , he is alone in the house
<user1> he is standing near a makeshift kitchen pantry .
<user1> he went to the sink turn the faucet on and off for few times
<user1> he just keeps moving things around in there , but he does take stuff off shelves and hold it
<user1> nothing else is heard other than her laughing
<user1> trying to play with the woman who is laughing
<user1> yes , he is sitting on the bed to put them on .
<user1> it is 35 seconds long
<user1> there is two inside the cupborrd , the top one has books and thebottom one cluttered
<user1> she seems quite content in the video
<user1> there 's just one person in this vido
<user1> no , he doesn 't sit on it .
<user1> just the one guy in the video .
<user1> the other girl is sitting in a chair holding something .
<user1> towards the end of the video she closes a laptop .
<user1> that is everything that happens
<user1> two sips in total she takes .
<user1> he just look neutral , no expression that i can see .
<user1> no he stays there the entire time .
<user1> i dont think they use it but it is open .
<user1> no i can 't hear anything other than normal background noise .
<user1> maybe he is in the 30 or 40s
<user1> i can see a man and woman
<user1> she was squatting most the video .
<user1> he doesn 't seem scared to me ,
<user1> i can 't tell but something is definitely plugged into the wall .
<user1> you can hear cars honking and driving by outside .
<user1> pants , and a shirt with a light jacket , color is blue
<user1> he walks out of the room out of shot so i can 't see where he goes
<user1> no , i don 't think so , he takes his coat off .
<user1> he holds the shirt and smiles at the camera .
<user1> yes i think they are roommates and they are watching a movie
<user1> no she is all alone
<user1> no , the man does not really gesture in any significant way .
<user1> nothing to else in this video
<user1> yes he is leaving at the end
<user1> he is looking in it
<user1> he talks to the pother person in foreign language .
<user1> no but if i were to guess he is probably boiling water for macaroni and cheese .
<user1> yes she is wearing pants
<user1> yes he is in that room the entire time .
<user1> he puts another item in the cabinet and then sneezes again . he repeats this several times .
<user1> that 's corttect ; he was taking pictures .
<user1> it could possibly be wine but it wasn 't a dark red . it was pinkish .
<user1> the whole time the camera is facing her , yes
<user1> no , that 's all that she does
<user1> not necessarily which is why i can 't be sure .
<user1> he has a neutral look on his face .
<user1> correct he grabs a couple of plates maybe 3 or 4
<user1> he was speaking but in foreign language .
<user1> no , he doesnt say anything .
<user1> he kind of gets mad or something he hits the medicine bottle down the steps
<user1> there are two people in this video ?
<user1> correct . he just stands there and presses buttons .
<user1> no , eating and drinking in a hallway snuggle with clothes , drinking coffee and eating a sandwich .
<user1> yes , you can hear the background noises .
<user1> about an arms ' full of dirty clothes .
<user1> a young man walks into the video and opens the dryer door .
<user1> a woman is vacuuming the floor
<user1> the clothes were just next to him on a shelf maybe , i cannot quite tell
<user1> women i think lloks like
<user1> yes , he is the only person in the video
<user1> then he walks out of the bathroom and leaves
<user1> yes , it seems like a pretty big kitchen .
<user1> no he isn 't sweeping into a dustpan
<user1> they didn 't talk . they just giggled .
<user1> he is the only person in the room .
<user1> nithing much more than that
<user1> no he doesn 't pick up a towel .
<user1> he throws the jacket on the floor and walks to the window .
<user1> just soft shuffling as he clears the desk .

<user1> the person is a female .
<user1> no , he never says anything , but he does smile
<user1> no pets are seen in the video
<user1> she sneezes after she stirs .
<user1> no , he stays at the table
<user1> after she looks through a few kinds of medicine she finds the one shes looking for
<user1> its a man in the video .
<user1> it looks like an office to me because there is a keyboard on the table .
<user1> he definitely could be typing on a phone .
<user1> i would guess he is about 25 .
<user1> he runs in and gets a cell phone and leaves .
<user1> a small red bucket turned upside down that he sits on .
<user1> yes , she drinks from the cup .
<user1> yes but throughout the video he is laughing continuously .
<user1> i think that the man you hear at the start is holding it .
<user1> she balances herself on a chair
<user1> the person seems to be calm ; not displaying much emotion .
<user1> yes he is walking down a hall .
<user1> no . i don 't think so .
<user1> yes . both people are women .
<user1> she appears to be looking directly at her phone .
<user1> he then comes back to the room and looks in the mirror it appears
<user1> yes , they look like teen girls .
<user1> no he just looks out the window ,
<user1> they are very light colored .
<user1> i can 't tell . it seems to be a small child .
<user1> just one man is in the video .

<user1> nothing else in the video
<user1> he sees food on the floor so he gets up
<user1> only one person seen in the video

<user1> at the end , after he throws something on the table , he walks away from the camera and the video ends
<user1> he is eating a sandwich also
<user1> that is correct , she does not do anything else
<user1> he put it down on a bookcase in front of him .
<user1> he seems to be adjusting the camera position on the stool

<user1> looks like a juice box and a piece of news paper
<user1> he knows he is being filmed
<user1> yes , there is the sound of the man moving the rag across the cardboard .
<user1> no it appears to be only him .

<user1> i meant selfie . i only heard the vacuum on then nothing
<user1> it is black marble ... nice looking .
<user1> just the sound of them moving and him kissing her
<user1> not a lot really , a small amount
<user1> he then picks up a book and starts reading it
<user1> no , he just randomly grabs one of the white parts and shakes it .

<user1> yes that is all that happens pretty much .
<user1> he appears to be trying to relax
<user1> no one else is in the video

<user1> i would guess her to be in her 30s .
<user1> he sets the glass down and then grabs a owel from a kids chair .
<user1> it 's hard to tell . it 's either a garage or possibly a kitchen .
<user1> it looks like a bedroom but uncertain .
<user1> no , you just see his head pop into the camera 's view for a second then disappear
<user1> no i dont see any thing
<user1> only the room he initially walked into .
<user1> so sorry just one person is there in
<user1> he may have got a drink
<user1> she does like the lights are too bright and puts the sandwich on the box next to the lamp
<user1> yes , pretty much that is all
<user1> they are wide , enough space for two people
<user1> he is talking till the end doesn 't end the call
<user1> no , but they do move away from the camera .
<user1> he put his " winter hat " back on .
<user1> no she does not leave the room .
<user1> he walks out of sight at the end .

<user1> empty shot , after a hand covers and uncovers the camera .
<user1> no , he seems the same the entire time .
<user1> no , but i hear background noise .
<user1> you can hear the scuffle of bringing in a chair and putting it down , other than that , no noise .

<user1> he does not talk in the video and there is no music
<user1> no he doesn 't empty or take out anything
<user1> yes , there is a man in the video .
<user1> a woman is in the video
<user1> i honestly cannot make out what he is saying .

<user1> i believe in trash can but i cannot see the floor .
<user1> looks like groceries i think .
<user1> no he is alone in the room
<user1> just off camera to the right and it looks like they shut off the camera .
<user1> he starts unbuttoning his shirt .
<user1> yes , both men are laughing and seems to be happy .
<user1> i can only hear his footsteps on the floor .

<user1> that pretty much sums it up that is correct
<user1> yes , it is a man .
<user1> both . it is a " muah ah ah ah " kind o laugh .
<user1> i see two people in the room .
<user1> he stands up to pick up a book off of a nearby chair , but it could be of any topic .
<user1> she does not leave the area
<user1> there are two men in the video . one man is throwing clothes into a basket while another man is eating in the kitchen area near a light .
<user1> the guy in the clip is white

<user1> it appears to be beige .
<user1> yes , he walks into the house where there is another boy
<user1> yes , he does drink the beverage
<user1> no they don 't talk at all
<user1> those items are not relevant to the summary you must make . they are simply filler questions . anyway , after he places the bowl down he picks up and turns on a flashlight and looks around the room .
<user1> yeah it looks messy a bit .
<user1> maybe late 20 ' s or early 30 ' s
<user1> he washes a tin foil small pan .
<user1> in a house . the first person is near the doorway
<user1> it appears to be a bedroom , possibly in a basement .
<user1> nothing , really , that is it . i think the younger one had a bag in her hands .
<user1> she leans it against the wall while she is reading .
<user1> the person in the video is male
<user1> no , she doesn 't look at the camera .

<user1> it 's hard to tell but it is on top of something
<user1> just a single person the entire video .
<user1> no the shot ends with him still recording
<user1> from the start she is working on her laptop in what appears to be the laundry room . she than stops grabs a book and leaves the room .
<user1> he is smiling and walking to the cabinet to open it . he then grabs a bag of food .
<user1> not really , the man just walks in with a box of laundry and then starts loading the machine
<user1> no , he just drinks the water .
<user1> all i can see is some writing and white space . it is not a video .
<user1> she is seen pouring coffe near the end , but not seen actually making it
<user1> he sits in a chair and drinks out of some type of mug
<user1> she is laughing looking at her phone .
<user1> no but he is goofy and runs out of the room .
<user1> he stands in the video ?

<user1> he 's probably under 30 years old
<user1> it 's not white , maybe cream color .
<user1> she runs downstairs with a broom then throws it aside as she ...
<user1> the man is probably in his 20s
<user1> she places it on the counter near the end
<user1> the video takes place in a house , and going up the stairs .
<user1> it is not bad , there could be more lights that are not on .

<user1> no , the house is very clean
<user1> random things he finds , mostly from on the table .

<user1> she is probably about 20 .
<user1> no , he doesn 't say anything .
<user1> i don 't know but i think that it could be a mother and child
<user1> no she doesn 't leave at all .
<user1> he was flipping through pages and then he got up and threw the book on a black curtain and he stormed out of the room .
<user1> he really does seem to be enjoying himself

<user1> he has short black hair
<user1> he rubs and caresses the blanket wrapped around him , as if he is trying to warm himself up
<user1> the little girl laughs a little bit

<user1> i think he has the camera setup as it is not moving as he is being recorded .
<user1> i don 't know . i do not see anyone or hear anyone else .

<user1> at first he is holding a broom .
<user1> she appears to be taking the memory out .

<user1> the man that walks in the room , exits the room . the other man is still resting in bed .

<user1> it looks like morning because he is wrapped in the blanket and looks like he just woke up
<user1> i 'm not sure what room he is in .
<user1> he 's doing several things . he appears to be writing something down on a yellow piece of paper at the beginning .

<user1> he never turns on the vacuum . he is holding it before setting it down . he never uses it .

<user1> yes they do know that
<user1> he is in front of the door such as an entryway
<user1> no there are no animals in the video
<user1> interesting question and wise observation . he didn 't climb up with a replacement bulb .. but still how often do light bulbs simply need to be slightly turned and then magically fixed ?
<user1> she looks like she is doing a though job cleaning
<user1> no she 's never with a phone
<user1> the woman seems to be in her 30s .

<user1> he sits in the doorway holding the pillow the entire time
<user1> yes the whole video takes place in the living room .
<user1> no they do not talk
<user1> it shows a woman only , but there 's a man somewhere as he could be heard at the start .
<user1> the boy at first is holding a plate of sandwich in a doorway .
<user1> there might be a pattern , but it is difficult to tell from this angle / distance .
<user1> no . he is pretending to do it so he doesn 't actually laugh . he just bends forward repeatedly . he is also wearing a blanket around him .
<user1> it is hard to tell what he is laughing at , probably laughing to himself .
<user1> he picks up a travel mug and drinks from it
<user1> no , he just sits at the table .
<user1> runs in place with two school books under his right arm , laughing occasionally .
<user1> initially he begins in a living room then walks into a kitchen
<user1> i believe it is a bed room .
<user1> no noise that i heard .
<user1> i believe that she is crying
<user1> no , she starts folding clothes and then takes a broom from the floor and start sweeping . after a few moments , she stops puts down the broom and laughs
<user1> yes , he gets a pink container but not sure what it is .
<user1> a man stands in the doorway of a hallway and sneezes a few times before walking down the hallway
<user1> he also stops to fold a blanket that is on the couch , but after that he leaves the room .
<user1> brilliant ! that 's it my friend

<user1> he doesn 't change his clothes .
<user1> yes , the person with the pillow looks kind of sad .
<user1> yes , he was alone and he walked to the door .

<user1> no , it hits her softly .
<user1> it looks a bit sloppy with things thrown around .
<user1> their in a bedroom and a man is sifting through a backpack
<user1> it looks like the laundry room because he starts to fold a linen
<user1> i cannot tell but she opens the door like she is about ready to leave but she doesn 't leave
<user1> she does not actual make anything , just opens what looks like a roll .
<user1> then he takes a step back and sits on the chair without takinghis eyes from the window .
<user1> he doesn 't get anything out . he just closes the door .

<user1> ambient noise ( like wind blowing ) , but no talking .

<user1> i am too far away to tell .
<user1> the man comes into the room from outside ... he is holding 3 folded blankets ... he drops them onto the ground inside ... then he sits down next to them ... then he grabs one and hugs it like hes weird for the rest of the vide

<user1> he says it is a concave mirror and jokes he looks fat and skinny like in a funhouse .
<user1> he does mess with it some as if he 's repairing something .
<user1> no , the box just had books in it .
<user1> no the video ends after he laughs
<user1> he starts to eat a sandwich and then he goes into a sneezing fit .
<user1> there appears to be light coming through a window , so i think it 's daytime

<user1> that 's all he does then it switches to a woman
<user1> nothing much more than that , at the end she turns off the tv

<user1> he uses the towel he has over his shoulder to wipe the mirror .
<user1> he uses his phone to take a picture of the stove .

<user1> yes he had pants on
<user1> his room is a mess and there is a lot of random items all around .
<user1> he did not smile or laugh .
<user1> after she takes some food from a plate .
<user1> the only thing he drops is the vacuum
<user1> yes , toward the end , he picks up a book and then leaves the room .
<user1> adjusting some clothes in the washing machine and grabbing what looks to be medicine off the shelf .
<user1> no there is pretty much it besides the dark room .

<user1> that is all . one comes in and turns around and takes a bite and the other one leaves with his blue bag
<user1> no . there is no speaking .
<user1> he begins closing the door behind him .
<user1> he puts them on the floor and on the chair next to him .
<user1> no one else enters the room .
<user1> you can hear the woman 's voice softly while she talks on the phone .
<user1> she pauses briefly then walks away
<user1> no the man stood in the same spot the whole time
<user1> it looks as though he is just aiming and shoot randomly
<user1> yes , that is the main gist of it .
<user1> from the viewpoint , it looks clean .
<user1> he does not talk at all
<user1> no , he just walks all the way down the corridor .
<user1> yes . the man turns off the stove .
<user1> yes she is always in the clip .
<user1> you can 't really see out but i did here a rooster crow as he looks out .

<user1> the person is in a neutral mook .
<user1> it is a woman in the video .
<user1> i can only see the first person bring in bags , it looks like there 's 2 - 3 bags he 's holding .
<user1> the bed is really messy .
<user1> he focuses kind of on the shelf holding stuff .
<user1> the video is only about six seconds long and he could be looking at something off camera for a few seconds
<user1> yes the camera does not change .
<user1> no but she opens it and places it on the same counter with the other book .
<user1> i can not make that out
<user1> with hand she sneezed in the video
<user1> he turns the stove on then he opens the drawer and gets something to stir the food with . then he stirs it .

<user1> yes , but the man is only in the laundry room for a little while
<user1> he pulls a pillow out of the box .
<user1> nothing he is just holding it to his chest and laughing and then keeps it down .
<user1> no sounds except camera static or ruffling

<user1> he at the beginning enters rooms
<user1> the person in the video is male .
<user1> there is one person in the video .
<user1> yes she is the only person in the clip .

<user1> a women is in the video
<user1> he looks to be 30 ' s .
<user1> there is never anyone else in the video
<user1> the scene ends with her walking away from the door to turn off the camera
<user1> it looks like a small study room or bedroom .
<user1> yes she is sitting on the floor the whole video
<user1> yes , there is a baby crying in the background .
<user1> the door may be a little bit heavy but the issue is that it is stuck .
<user1> yes , the woman is on the sofa and the man is sitting on the floor .
<user1> no , it doesn 't look trashy , just old and worn out .
<user1> yes , the camera stays focused on one location .
<user1> no , she just picks it up off of the burner , takes out the spoon she was stirring with and places the pot and it 's contents in the sink
<user1> you can hear a slight whir from the fan , along with his epic air guitar music .
<user1> it is daytime in the video

<user1> nobody else comes into the room .
<user1> i can see only one woman
<user1> no he does not say anything .
<user1> she seems to be by herself , yes .
<user1> he does close his eyes as soon as he lays down .
<user1> the door to the dryer is oen ! thanks so much

<user1> possibly , but it is hard to tell with no sounds
<user1> he stirs a pot in the kitchen and goes over to the counter to kiss a picture .
<user1> there is only one person in the video .
<user1> they 're both wearing shirts and jeans .
<user1> it looks like he has a pen or pencil in his hand to write with in the video
<user1> he is pulling clothes out of the bottom and folding them .

<user1> he starts dusting it with a cloth .
<user1> he is moving at a moderate pace

<user1> not really , he just plays with the phone
<user1> no he doesn 't he just sneezes
<user1> no , he does not turn any pages .
<user1> by my judgement , it appears the man is late twenties to early thirties .
<user1> he picks up a glass on the table next to him , but never has a chance to drink from it as he begins sneezing .
<user1> yes , that is what he is ordering his pie on .
<user1> the laptop is open you can see it is on cause the screen is lit up .
<user1> he has a baseball cap on
<user1> yes a little when he picks up the shoes from the floor .
<user1> yeah , he looks much more angry than she does .

<user1> i see a wall lamp and bottles , plus he is holding a bag .
<user1> she opens the fridge , gets out the milk , pours a little in a glass , takes a drink , dhuts the fridge with he foot then turns something on behind the stove .

<user1> no , it is just the one man .

<user1> i can 't tell what he 's watching because the screen is so far from the camera .
<user1> the ball is tossed onto the couch or bed and lands right under the dogs front paws so the dog stays there .
<user1> i guess so , she looks busy
<user1> no i never see him look at the camera .
<user1> only background noise and sounds , like the towel dropping , no others .
<user1> she is in a dining room

<user1> he is bending over trying to gather the bag .
<user1> he puts the pen down and then takes his sweater off and tosses it off screen and picks up phone .
<user1> i think so , but the video ends before he opens the door .
<user1> that about sums it up
<user1> she just keeps trying to pose for the picture .
<user1> my guess would be the kitchen .
<user1> the girl is 23 and the man is 25 years old .
<user1> the dog just walks in looks at her and walks out .
<user1> there is only one male through out the entire video
<user1> she just holds it in her hand

<user1> no she just laughed right before closing the door
<user1> the women appears first then the man walks in

<user1> yes she does while standing on the stairs
<user1> there was a child asleep on a mattress on the floor .

<user1> the person appears to be white
<user1> no he does not say anything
<user1> yes , the woman is moving around .
<user1> it 's hard to tell but from the quick glimpse i got i 'd say a man .

<user1> he gets up and grabs a grouped handful of straw and begins sweeping the floor .
<user1> she is holding a broom and dusting cobwebs from the ceiling
<user1> there is nobody else there .

<user1> no . she is alone the entire time .
<user1> that is pretty much it . it transfer the liquid into another cup and takes a drink . then , puts the cup on the shelf

<user1> both of them appear to be somewhere in their teens to early 20s .

<user1> he started off in the kitchen
<user1> yes i believe it is a living room .

<user1> the camera operator talks to them in an foreign language .
<user1> there may be a glass on a table next to the chair .
<user1> no it is small , but maybe something like a donut type , but he evidently does not like it when he goes into pantry and takes another bite of it then slams it down on pantry shelf .

<user1> mostly an bedroom merly neatly drawn away clothes and such probably bangladesh type of hotel

<user1> i think she is a teenager in her early twenties
<user1> you got it thats it
<user1> it ends when he takes a bite out of the sandwich .
<user1> there was no music in the video
<user1> it seems to be a paperback novel .
<user1> it is 38 seconds long
<user1> i can only see his plaid shirt
<user1> nothing else happens of import .
<user1> a flat pan , like a griddle .
<user1> no , he doesn 't do that

<user1> yes it is the phone by the edge of the table
<user1> there is no noise , although at the end there is a smacking noise as the filmer turns off the camera .

<user1> nothing is said be he is giggling the whole time
<user1> he sneezed after he took a byte of food
<user1> no one is speaking in the video

<user1> judging from the kitchen windows , it appears to be nighttime outside .
<user1> he put the pillow on the bed between two small white pillows .
<user1> it looks like he picks it up from the floor .
<user1> he turned around and ran out of the room very fast
<user1> yep , that 's the gist of it
<user1> no he does not touch anything else but there is a tv playing in the background .
<user1> he flips , and does appear to read some .
<user1> it appears to be nighttime , due to the streetlight reflecting off the metal security door on the outside of the wooden door , and the thin slice of sky visible is dark .
<user1> he is walking down the hallway and picking things up .
<user1> he only does those things .
<user1> she seems content , doesnt really have anu expression .

<user1> yes , he looks at the clothing like it 's a baby and then turns a knob on the oven
<user1> yes , he turned the water on and washed it .
<user1> i think she tells him he can put it back on the shelf .
<user1> the man runs around the table , after sitting and drinking water . after he runs around the table , he switches the kitchen light switch off and on several times , and this makes a noise .
<user1> not really that i was able to see here .

<user1> no . he just walks away but i can 't see where we walk to , but it was not in the direction of the bed .
<user1> probably early 20 ' s . it 's a girl . she might be late teens , possibly .

<user1> he is holding a broom in his right hand while he flips through a book .
<user1> she doesn 't move any body part as she is looking at the guy .

<user1> he grabs a pillow and hit the lights
<user1> just he was looking phone and standing
<user1> yes he wears a blanket at first then throws it on the floor and walks over to a mirror and checks himself out

<user1> he does not use a mouse .
<user1> some voice , some squeaking sound
<user1> i don 't know it doesn 't go any further after he takes it off and grabs the detergent
<user1> definitely goofing off . he also tosses a ball up in the air and catches it several times .
<user1> she does not take a drink .
<user1> no he spends half the video trying to turn on the stove
<user1> common sense would dictate that he has to pick them up to throw them .
<user1> there are two people in the video .
<user1> mostly stone faced throughout the video , i 'd say bordering on frustrated .
<user1> there is some background noise .
<user1> i just hear the rustling around
<user1> of the home ? i would say that it is the bedroom .
<user1> at first she has a bottle that maybe looks like vitamins . she puts it in the drawer .
<user1> he moves through the garage to some extent .
<user1> i do not know . he just puts his hand on the doorknob like he is gonna open it .
<user1> hes sneezing and sitting in a room .
<user1> i can hear the sound of the bottle with pills in it when he shakes it . also i can hear the when he scrapes the pan with a spatula .
<user1> no the water bottle stays empty after
<user1> he is at the top of the stairs the whole time
<user1> no . there is only the tv noise
<user1> no , no one else enters during the video .
<user1> she is standing in the room the whole time .
<user1> yes , some canned food and a bottle of juice .
<user1> the only sound that can be heard is the background noise from the tv
<user1> just one sleeping and the other is grabbing some clothes from the floor and putting them away
<user1> one man in the video .
<user1> no this man is alone the entire time no else enters or leaves
<user1> no he is just holding on to it .

<user1> no , he stays there the whole time

<user1> she leaves the frame at the end of the clip .
<user1> yes , he is mostly listening to the other person explain something
<user1> no , cooking in end of the video
<user1> yes , he is reading something on his phone
<user1> the man is touching some dinner plates
<user1> there is one man in the video
<user1> pretty much that is it , guess we need ques 7-10 to finish to bonus ask away , like what shoes is he wearing
<user1> he is wearing a red shirt and dark shorts
<user1> actually , it 's not a cellphone . the caption says it is a doorknob she is fixing .
<user1> seems to be keys camera and something i cant identify .
<user1> she is holding it from the beginning .
<user1> no she opens it up and places the cereal inside
<user1> he takes his shirt off after that , rather frantically
<user1> no , just the woman that comes into the room .
<user1> no i think we 've got it covered
<user1> there is no audio in the video .
<user1> the second person takes drink at the end and the cat licks himself in front of the tv
<user1> no , he is in the bathroom at the end of the video .

<user1> no you can 't , but you can see the light from it
<user1> yes i do hear the tv sounds .

<user1> a person tyding up something on the pantry
<user1> no . they are hitting each other .
<user1> no that is all that happened .

<user1> no there is nothing else important
<user1> i can 't see any thing , just a dark screen .
<user1> no , i cannot hear any noise
<user1> i think he is looking at someone .

<user1> several clothes items laying on the floor .
<user1> no she does not talk to anyone .
<user1> yes they are sitting the entire time .

<user1> the women is washing dishes and watching her husband cook dinner .

<user1> the man walks at the doorway of his closet holding a chair in his hand and then plays with a towel
<user1> no you know all that happens .
<user1> he goes in the bathroom , drops a box that is on the sink on the floor , and laughs .

<user1> no , they do not say anything but they sneeze
<user1> no he never says anything .
<user1> she continues to play with the phone .
<user1> no she does not speak to anyone .

<user1> they do not speak at al
<user1> there isn 't any talking but there is background noise i can 't tell what it is
<user1> it 's not big or small , just a normal size vacuum but not more like a sweeper .

<user1> it is hard to tell but it looks like it might be clothes
<user1> i think he just had a sneezing fit .
<user1> no that is all you have covered it all .
<user1> the man empties the shovel part of the broom into an empty bag while the dog plays alone with the broom .
<user1> she muttered something inaudible at the end

<user1> the man is sitting down indian style handling some foood .
<user1> yes , there is just background noise

<user1> yeah he looks to be maybe 14 or 15 .

<user1> she is doing the same thing the entire time , laughing at the laptop
<user1> i don 't see any cats .

<user1> yes , he sits and eats , looks like fritos .
<user1> he looks into the mirror next to the shelf and starts laughing ( for some odd reason )
<user1> he walks toward the middle of the room , holding a book , from which he reads aloud .
<user1> person is a man in the video
<user1> he doesnt show any emotion at all .
<user1> he did not speak only audio is the back ground noise . he did not say anything .
<user1> she only cleans the one shelf
<user1> he is a white man .
<user1> he walks into the bathroom which is a big bathroom split into areas and turns on a light and opens a cabinet to get the blanket
<user1> no , he remains seated the whole time .
<user1> no i have no idea why he 's laughing
<user1> that is all that is happening in the video .
<user1> it is hard to tell but i dont see a bed

<user1> no clue . i wouldn 't want to guess give you an inaccurate answer
<user1> no . not really i only see a part of it but i can 't tell
<user1> that is the end of the video
<user1> she comes in with a throw pillow and goes to the other side of the room , then grabs some dirty dishes and leaves the room
<user1> before while he is hugging the pillow in his lap
<user1> no . he does not turn it on . he stays near the light fixture .
<user1> it 's light but there are no windows the indicate the time of day . i would imagine daytime .

<user1> he looks at his phone and laughs at one point . there is no other sound .
<user1> no there is no audio
<user1> she is hugging the pillows
<user1> it looked like a loaf of bread or some snacks .

<user1> no the girl is standing down and the guy is on the stairs
<user1> no , just the one boy does

<user1> looking at a pillow at first
<user1> nothing the video ends with her putting things in the bag
<user1> no he stands there the whole time
<user1> yes , that happens at the end of the video

<user1> she doesn 't look happy or even sad . we can say content .
<user1> he takes a couple of drinks from the cup
<user1> he is standing by his bed on the floor looking at his phone in his hand .
<user1> the box appears to be empty .
<user1> she does not hang anything up .
<user1> a person is walking into the bedroom with a box and sets it on the bed

<user1> yes , she is in it at the beginning
<user1> no , he is still undressing when the video ends .
<user1> no , she does nothing else after cooking on the stove .
<user1> i can see only a toy like object in her hands .

<user1> i never seen his face until the end and it was really quick
<user1> not that i can see
<user1> yes , she is sorting . when she picks up a towel from the floor , she wipes her face with it .
<user1> no he shows no type of emotion .
<user1> she just threw it on the floor . she did not took it to a trash
<user1> hard to tell what kind of room the camera doesnt show enough . i think there might be a window and a closet .
<user1> it is a blue reusable shopping bag
<user1> i can 't really tell , it 's kind of a weird scene .
<user1> he is in the entire video by himself
<user1> i heard voice of when he sneezed
<user1> a man is watching some tv and laughing . then he starts sneezing .
<user1> yes he does not leave until the end .

<user1> i guess he does look smart .
<user1> he looks maybe 12 or 13 to me .
<user1> no just the man and the boy are seen .

<user1> oh yes , she appears to enjoy multitasking .
<user1> no , he is still in the kitchen at the stove .
<user1> well , he chubby and sloppy .
<user1> he takes his phone out of his pocket
<user1> he never touches it again after setting it down .
<user1> there is one person in the video .

<user1> i am not really sure . it seems like maybe blankets .
<user1> the only one in the clip is the man .
<user1> yes he does and flips through some pages after
<user1> no she is actually alone in the rooms .
<user1> he walks back into bedroom or living room
<user1> just the sounds of the frame hitting the table .

<user1> there is a window over the sink .
<user1> no , he places something into the oven .
<user1> he has the phone up to his ear when the video starts . assume he may be talking to someone .
<user1> a man is sitting on a couch and playing some games on a laptop and then he closes the laptop and puts it on a bag as he is standing .
<user1> that 's all the clip shows . cuts off when he takes the jacket out
<user1> nothing else only the jacket
<user1> no he does not close the closet door ,
<user1> no , i did not hear her speak
<user1> that is the end of the video .
<user1> her mood appears neutral , possibly tired or sick .
<user1> no , i think that is it .
<user1> she uses the towel only .
<user1> it looks black and curly to me .
<user1> yes it does . he puts a sweater , a book and hanger in the closet and then closes the door .
<user1> no , she 's just watching him i guess .
<user1> a man is tending to things on a stove . he takes a cup from the cupboard . he walks back to the stove then sneezes
<user1> he was already there from the begining
<user1> i don 't see a book but from the conversation it sounds like he is studying
<user1> there is some staticy sound but no voices .
<user1> yes , the man who is holding the camera speaks the most .
<user1> the man is standing in a living room .
<user1> this person is in a bedroom .
<user1> yes she is alone here
<user1> when the video starts he walks over to a small table .
<user1> yes , it 's just the one guy .
<user1> possibly a bedroom , but i can 't be 100 % sure
<user1> no , he just sits there .
<user1> that 's when he turns off the camera
<user1> no , it ends with him getting the water
<user1> she grabs a towel from the shelf .
<user1> two people are shown in the video
<user1> he is pretending to play a video game while in reality the tv is playing a movier
<user1> middle aged or slightly above
<user1> there are two boys in a walkway talking .
<user1> no just the man is in the clip

<user1> it appears to be a table cloth .
<user1> there is only one person
<user1> no when his done writing he jumps down
<user1> to the left of him is a small resource book he 's looking at too . when he 's done he closes the book and puts it away .
<user1> the sound after he pressed the button on the coffee maker .
<user1> no the only think i see is a small dog that walks into the kitchen .
<user1> a man is fixing a shelf and another walks into the room .
<user1> i see only one person , but i hear a baby crying in the background
<user1> yes , he is always in that hallway .
<user1> he has his hand over the liquid in the glass the whole time . it could be water .
<user1> she does not attempt to put on the shoe .
<user1> it is a dresser with candles on top
<user1> she appears to be somewhat happy
<user1> yes they look like they could be brothers .
<user1> he smiles while looking for groceries , pulls out a bag of chips and eats it then it cuts off .
<user1> he is the only person in the video .
<user1> he put it down on the ground
<user1> i cannot really hear what he said
<user1> there is a separate basket full of clothes in front of the washer .
<user1> she picks up her shoes from the floor .
<user1> i think he is happy
<user1> he places them in the closet and turns off the light
<user1> he is holding a book
<user1> i can not see that well
<user1> yes he throws the pillow back down on the bed and starts walking towards the door
<user1> she is laying sideways on the bed
<user1> no , none that i can see or hear .
<user1> no they don show on the video
<user1> she throws the package on the floor
<user1> he doens 't take the first shirt off .
<user1> he keeps smiling at himself for a few seconds , then he opens a door on the right
<user1> yes a man walks into the kitchen and goes straight to the fridge .
<user1> i can 't tell if the stove is on .
<user1> after she puts the book on the table she straightens up the blankets on the top shelf of closet and then takes out her self phone and takes a selfie then leaves .
<user1> a tank top and shorts
<user1> he walks out onto the patio and winces from the brightness
<user1> i didn 't hear any sounds .
<user1> it is sitting on a window sill .
<user1> it a slow video but so far yes
<user1> no he smirks though a couple of times
<user1> she was laughing and the got up from the bed .
<user1> she puts her phone or camera on the table on the left
<user1> i dont think so so
<user1> he doesn 't show much emotion and if anything is bored
<user1> she is laughing in the beginning .
<user1> then she reaches for the door knob and closes the living room door and pours herself coffee in a cup and it ends .
<user1> there is a lot of clutter but too far to name
<user1> aside from what i just mentioned he doesn 't do anything else .
<user1> no , he doesn 't speak but sneezes 3 times .
<user1> yes he does after he is done drinking from it .
<user1> it starts with him putting something in the closet
<user1> no he just saunters out of the room
<user1> no , nobody is in frame when the video starts
<user1> it looks like some pizza .
<user1> thanks , hope i gaved an accurate description .
<user1> he takes the bag and opens the door to the basement and leaves
<user1> i think it says new york .
<user1> there is no shelf , it 's a pull down screen .
<user1> no , he sets it down before he leaves .
<user1> they never talk to each other
<user1> a box of stuff i do not know what is in it
<user1> that is all that happens .
<user1> it is static-y the whole time but at the end someone off camera calls out his name .
<user1> puts glass down , walks towards book shelf , grabs book , looks at the cover .
<user1> no , i believe he is alone in the room .
<user1> that is what the video is about
<user1> he is in the bathroom opening a cabinet
<user1> no one noise is he hat-shoots and sneezes
<user1> no , the person never speaks during the video .
<user1> not at all . it appears to be unorganized storage .
<user1> i only see one person .
<user1> a man is in the kitchen .
<user1> after cooking he begins to sweep
<user1> yes there is audio , i can hear a machine like dish washer running and then her footsteps as she runs across the room .
<user1> yeah he walks away after putting it down .
<user1> once it 's full he turns the spigot back off and puts some kind of brush into it .
<user1> yes she moved her blanket
<user1> looks to me like a bathroom .
<user1> the person walks near the stand takes a cover from the stand and fills in with some stuffs .
<user1> hard to tell from this perspective
<user1> no , ketp sorting the laundry .
<user1> nothing really , just picks up the broom
<user1> she doesn 't move anything around .
<user1> he walks back to the chair and sits down .
<user1> she doesn 't move very much during the video , but when she does , it is at a normal pace .
<user1> the leftward direction of the frame
<user1> just the sounds of her shuffling around and when she slips her shoes off .
<user1> she puts something in her pocket , rearranges some things on the sink and grabs her coffee mug and sits down on a chair
<user1> the only emotion i can make out is curiosity and maybe boredom
<user1> no i dont hear anything
<user1> no i dont see any pets in the video
<user1> he grabs them from the stovetop
<user1> no , he is just showing off the phone
<user1> he is in the bathroom but not for long he comes in grabs something then exits
<user1> no . there is only a little writing . maybe it is an email or a blog . it is not big enough for me to read it .
<user1> just him moving around and opening the soda .
<user1> you hear someone give directions to the man on what to do from off camera but no dialogue
<user1> no . i only see the laundry area
<user1> yes , that is a good summary .
<user1> i didn 't hear any sound .
<user1> i wouldnt be surprised if he is single , his kitchen looks to be a total disaster .
<user1> the woman is holding a coffee cup
<user1> no . he never stands up .
<user1> no just that she looks into the fridge and then starts cooking .
<user1> it looks like it is a bathroom

<user1> there is only one person in the video .
<user1> no she holds onto the glass to undress
<user1> it is old looking and in black and white .

<user1> he is putting on a shirt .
<user1> no , after that he opens an amazon box and takes a shorts out of it .

<user1> there 's just the one man .
<user1> this appears to be a female , wanna know her age ?

<user1> not much at all just the girl working on studding the posture position

<user1> no way possible for me to correctly guess that from what i can see .
<user1> amiga , but he opens a bathroom door but doesn 't walk inside and then goes to the mirror and holds up the camera and the video ends
<user1> just the sound of his shoes as he walks around
<user1> he walks slowly to the table .
<user1> yes , it is pretty small .

<user1> he is on the floor looking at a mirror
<user1> he walks away and picks up a box or something .
<user1> he is running around the driveway and ran back to the back of the garage once .

<user1> he picks up some clothes
<user1> he checks under the counter .
<user1> it begins with a person grasping a pillow going down the stairs .
<user1> it appears to be yellow .
<user1> it appears that he is alone

<user1> just one bite and he put it down
<user1> no only one hand is used at a time
<user1> yes just one person is here
<user1> the woman starts running down the steps
<user1> i cannot tell . the window has some sort of covering over it .

<user1> he does a little bit
<user1> yes he did grab the laptop
<user1> no , he doesn 't interact with anything else .
<user1> he sits at the chair in front of the desk
<user1> it looks like it would be a living room or dining room
<user1> yes deep in thought at the end of video
<user1> it is a white cabinet
<user1> at one point , after addressing the invisible person , he takes the sandwich apart and stares at half of it .
<user1> no it is kind of dim in the room .
<user1> no , i don 't think so .
<user1> the one boy stands there looking through a box of pictures

<user1> no there is no music .
<user1> no she just uses the dry cloth
<user1> all i see is a plastic bag in it .

<user1> he is just standing there through the whole video
<user1> yes that is correct it 's really short
<user1> no they are looking at each other or the camera .
<user1> at first a lady is writing on a notepad .

<user1> nothing the video ended after it

<user1> yes he is eating the sandwich and drinking from the mug .
<user1> yes , he is walking back and forth and then runs in place .
<user1> no . that is pretty much the whole video . the boy does look like he was watching tv before he started sneezing .

<user1> he then sits on the bed .
<user1> i think he is as he is flipping through pages .
<user1> he took a sip of his coffee
<user1> he does not do anything else .

<user1> she is in a garage .
<user1> the dog stays at the top of the stairs .
<user1> the lady grabs a blanket and sits down at the table

<user1> the front door is shut the entire time .
<user1> yes i see one towel in the bathroom .
<user1> nothing , that is how the video ends
<user1> it appears to be a bucket .
<user1> i cannot confirm because her back is turned to the camera as she pours the coffe
<user1> there is no sound in the video .
<user1> i 'm not sure but it looks like a piece of an apple .
<user1> no there are no sounds
<user1> just normal background rustling noise and she says something in another language .
<user1> no , he came into the bedroom from another room .
<user1> he is holding a drink product

<user1> another person walks by and starts undressing while talking on the phone .

<user1> no , he does not directly look at the camera .
<user1> he is alone eating potato chips and then he smiles to himself and then turns on a lamp
<user1> there are not any pets or animals
<user1> i believe it is a mountain dew of some sort
<user1> just the noises of running around .
<user1> yes , and he turns around and looks at the camera last .
<user1> goes to undress before looking out the window
<user1> no , they are not dressed alike

<user1> yes , only one person in the video
<user1> unsure , i don 't see it , nor hear it .

<user1> yes , he stays in bed .
<user1> the man is covered when the video first starts .
<user1> there is someone holding the camera .
<user1> he is just taking bites out of the same snack i think
<user1> there are two men visible in the video .
<user1> yes , there is a broom in her hand .
<user1> no he sits there the entire time
<user1> no , he just sits in it for about 10 seconds then gets up .
<user1> it 's a vacuum cleaner and i believe it 's a young man , not woman .
<user1> yes that was the only thing .
<user1> just the sound of books rustling against the shelf
<user1> no , the girl is trying to put a pillow on the top shelf of the closet .
<user1> he appears to be fixing his hair in front of a mirror .
<user1> yes , i can hear her laughing .

<user1> no he looks at the same page the whole time .

<user1> and holds it in his right hand and the video ends . it is a sweatshirt not a coat but coat is fine .
<user1> it takes place in a bedroom .
<user1> yes there is only one man there

<user1> the man sits on a chair
<user1> just his footsteps as he walks
<user1> no , she tosses her sweatshirt on the chair before grabbing the cup but does not sit down before she starts drinking .
<user1> he might be about 17 years old
<user1> correction there is a tv partially visible , but it is a wall panel that is being repaired
<user1> up in the air , i guess for fun , then immediately walks out .
<user1> it doesn 't show the end of the cord so not sure , but the entire vacuum is in the box .
<user1> yes it does land on the floor .

<user1> i can not see her face at all
<user1> the video is 25 seconds .
<user1> it loos like just dishes on the counter but it 's hard to tell .
<user1> yes , there is only one man in the video .

<user1> he just paces back and forth in front of the tv
<user1> it is a wooden desk .
<user1> appears to be some area near an living room
<user1> then the video just ends with him standing there .
<user1> i don 't know , he just grabs it , turns around , and tosses it on the floor .
<user1> they are in their early 30s maybe .

<user1> there is no noise made
<user1> no only the one guy the whole time

<user1> no the man does not talk in the video .
<user1> the video starts him standing in the middle of a room .

<user1> this appears to be the kitchen
<user1> he does not open any door , he puts the bag in the cabinet
<user1> he first enters the room laughing , then goes to the table , picks up what looks like a skirt , then folds it and throws it down on the table .
<user1> he sits on the floor in front of a laptop that is on a table .

<user1> she is tying the shoestrings .
<user1> no he appears to be alone there

<user1> one man walks out of frame while the other seams to be putting some laundry away .
<user1> there are no dishes out on the table

<user1> she holds the bread , which is in the form of a sandwich , and pretends to take a bite out of it .
<user1> one man is in the video , but you can hear a child in the room too
<user1> she first seems to be moving the mouse looking at her computer .

<user1> she puts a towel around her shoulders , then takes it off and walks to the camera .
<user1> hard to say as no windows are in view .
<user1> it looks like an average size
<user1> the lights aren 't that bright but it might be white or light blue or grey .
<user1> the one is wearing a more dressy shirt and the other just normal clothes
<user1> you could hear them making noises but no talking
<user1> a man is bending over the tv trying to connect a cord into it . he has orange shorts on .
<user1> the video ends withe couple embracing . she must have said yes .
<user1> that is all that happened in the video
<user1> he fixes about two frames
<user1> most of the time . the person walks into the place and walks away at the end of the video

<user1> no i cants see the tv
<user1> i am not sure , maybe a spook
<user1> yes the older woman never stand and the young girl comes into the video from the right and starts climbing the stairs

<user1> the person drinking gets up an hits something
<user1> the boy standing is holding a cup and sipping and the other is sitting with the cushion on his lap .
<user1> exactly right . caption is right
<user1> no he is by himself .
<user1> looks like his bed room
<user1> a camera , that also worries me . who is he taking pictures for ?

<user1> she is in the same room the entire time
<user1> he has dark brown straight medium short hair .
<user1> no , there are no conversion in the video .

<user1> i would say he stays in the same space .

<user1> he walks from the kitchen to the living room .
<user1> they are in a bedroom .
<user1> he bunches up the blanket and it looks like he 's wiping his hands with it .

<user1> there is only one person in the video
<user1> yes , he laughs and stops looking at what he is holding but he does not put it away or walk away .

<user1> his expression seems neutral - not sad or happy .
<user1> yes , he comes through door in the video
<user1> maybe early morning before sunrise or evening , the room behind her is fairly dark . and the kitchen seems to have low lighting so it is hard to tell exactly .

<user1> yes , he is there the entire clip .
<user1> when he first starts tossing the pillow up in the air he smiles once .

<user1> no it is a dining chair
<user1> yes , he does not move from his spot .
<user1> they enter the room and sit on the couch .

<user1> he puts what looks like salt in the pot .
<user1> no , he doesn 't sit down the entire video
<user1> he turns around and starts to walk away from the bucket

<user1> the camera shows a shelf for food as the man looks through the back pack .
<user1> yes , you can see the baby lying on its back in front of the tv .

<user1> the cabinet is already open when the video starts .
<user1> he picks up the shoes and puts them on the table . then smiles at the shoes and picks up a medicine bottle .
<user1> no he is just looking down , like he just woke up .

<user1> well the man is probably in his 30s and the boy looks to be about 9 or 10 .

<user1> he just holds it in his hands
<user1> i can hear shuffling sounds and some background noises .

<user1> a person is throwing a pillow while laughing at the start
<user1> i can 't tell what it is , but later in the video she has an oil bottle in her hand .
<user1> he is holding a glass and staring off into the distance .

<user1> no they do not seem to acknowledge each other
<user1> yes . the tv played until the video ends .
<user1> that 's about allhe does . have a nice day

<user1> the room is a hallway .
<user1> i am unable to determine the type of snack it is .
<user1> she justs folds and then turns to the camera and smiles .
<user1> he may be in his 50 ' s
<user1> he picks up the towel and folds it and puts it on a bed down the hall .
<user1> yes she is all alone
<user1> i 'm guessing food since that is where she took something from to eat .
<user1> the monitor is black like usual
<user1> she just sets it down . does not use it .
<user1> yes the room seems to be quite clean .
<user1> he throws them down the hall .
<user1> there is a tv playing in the backround
<user1> looks like a a desk with some plants on it . t
<user1> the scene takes place in a living room .
<user1> no he is standing all the time
<user1> it ends the same way . she does the same thing through the entire video .
<user1> no , he doesn 't seem to be .
<user1> yes , but just a little muffled talking .
<user1> there is one person in the video .
<user1> yes i can see a couple orange ones swimming around
<user1> actually i think it is daytime you can see light coming from the windows .
<user1> no there is no date stamp .
<user1> she looks about 20 years old
<user1> maybe mid twenties i would say
<user1> he looks to be in his 20s .
<user1> no , but the man was lauging while reading a comic book that he grabbed from the shelf .
<user1> it looks like some kind of note , hard to tell
<user1> there is but it 's just camera and unintentional noise
<user1> looks like a girl but i 'm not sure if i 'm right
<user1> no they are not talking
<user1> he puts the towel on top of the dryer .
<user1> i think so , he looks like he is intoxicated
<user1> yes , he 's all ready there at the start .
<user1> it is open already . it is a front loader .
<user1> no , the video ends with him sitting and staring intently out the window .
<user1> only the sound of the tv .
<user1> she just keeps them on the side
<user1> the lighting is bad so i can 't see his face really so i can 't tell but he 's not slamming stuff around .
<user1> she throws them behind her to the right .
<user1> my guess would be that he 's in his teens , but there is nothing that ids his age . and the tv ( which is not visible in the video ) doesn 't give any insight into what type of program he is watching .
<user1> i have ni idea , i think they are just smiling for the camera
<user1> i only see one , it is kind of in the corner .
<user1> yes he walks past the table to where he takes coat off then after shutting the door crosses the room to turn light off .
<user1> i think he is in the living room
<user1> he is going up the stairs and sweeping them as he goes .
<user1> he was already kneeling on the floor . after that , he picks up a vacuum that he was inspecting .
<user1> a man sweeping a hallway near the front door which is open .
<user1> no , it looked like a storage for vaious items
<user1> he is putting the laptop inside .
<user1> a man is staring at his computer .
<user1> he is looking for something .
<user1> yes he drinks from it one time .
<user1> one person is in the video

<user1> he abandons the clothes and looks at his phone
<user1> yes that is a correct statement .
<user1> he looks to be around 35
<user1> he is on the phone as the video begins , so i am unsure .
<user1> she is doing nothing special at that time .
<user1> it looks like it is night time .
<user1> he walks into the scene , picks up some folded clothing , then picks up a pillow underneath the clothing ?
<user1> i hear something beeping , not sure if it 's a phone or something else .
<user1> he looks in a mirror set on a low table .

<user1> he was always carrying it .
<user1> they are already prepared for the day
<user1> yes it is only one person .
<user1> a girl is sitting on a chair . she is looking at a picture . she says " i love you . just kidding , i take it back . " then she throws the picture on the ground .

<user1> i hear what sounds to me like when a dog shakes it 's head and it 's tags jangle .
<user1> he goes to the recorder of the video and takes what i believe to be gum from him / her .
<user1> i think he continues to take a picture of the women

<user1> right before video ends he places his hand on what looks like a black mouse
<user1> a woman is lying down with a blanket on a sofa and wakes up .
<user1> i cannot determine what he chose
<user1> the walls don 't have anything on them .

<user1> he cuddles it and walks into the orther room where he sits down and covers himself with it
<user1> he stands in the same place until the last sneeze where he turns to his right and takes a step back so that we see only his side , never his head .

<user1> no i dont see any
<user1> only one person is in there .
<user1> it ends after the lady sneezes and the other one immediately picks up shoes and drops them into the box
<user1> no the man does not show emotion
<user1> normal mood , nothing special or out of the ordinary .
<user1> a gentlemen walks into the room , and places a cup down next to a blanket

<user1> he looks on the counter and picks up a cookie or brownie
<user1> i am not sure what language it is
<user1> he 's talking to himself about being disgusted cleaning .
<user1> finally he is holding bag and towel
<user1> she just stands up in front of it .
<user1> no nothing else important happens
<user1> dark , looks like a dark brown .
<user1> yes , she smells it right before she sneezes into it
<user1> he only picks things up to clean under them .
<user1> he is trying to take the perfect selfie .
<user1> i did not see any pets .
<user1> he walks back into the kitchen and grabs a cup to fill it up with water . he then pours the water in the sink and puts it down . he walks out of sight .
<user1> the video ends with her on the stairs , looking at her phone .
<user1> they haven 't left the room in the end .
<user1> that is the last thing i remember . although only one of them is walking . the other is watching .
<user1> he is watching it so
<user1> a man is crouched down with a wet rag cleaning the floor .
<user1> i guess he 's planning to go out the door .

<user1> he holds it all the time
<user1> a man in running in place
<user1> she uses the rag to clean the walls .
<user1> no no one sits down in this video .
<user1> after he takes the dishes into another room , the camera just looks into another room and then the video ends .
<user1> nothing else of interest happens .
<user1> no he never gets aroud to it
<user1> he just keeps playing with the pillow .
<user1> at the end he also turns off the light in the bathroom .

<user1> no but he does point to something on the stove
<user1> yes , the smaller boy shut the pantry door .
<user1> she ate something and drank coffee
<user1> he seems like he might be a little apprehensive about something .
<user1> no the man justs coughs once .

<user1> he doesn 't look like he has any emotion .
<user1> he is not eating bread , the bread putting another place and he was standing and doing some cooking

<user1> she does not reappear in the video
<user1> it is an open area with lamps and a couch .

<user1> i think it 's an entryway or hallway .
<user1> nothing else he did apart from what you said
<user1> no he walked right back out
<user1> he is laughing at something on his laptip , then takes his shoes off , laughs some more , and closes his laptop .

<user1> he is alone in the kitchen all by himself .
<user1> nothing else , he walks in and asks her to help , then she gets up and walks out the door .
<user1> i can hear banging noises of something moving and a woman off camera talking but can 't tell what she says .
<user1> he turns off the lights

<user1> one person is 35 and the other 12
<user1> no just the one man
<user1> no he sits the whole time

<user1> they never look at the camera .
<user1> yes , a female with saying one word in a foreign language , and him sneezing twice .
<user1> no , the man in the video is doing his own thing .
<user1> she is young probably early twenties .
<user1> he writes in the book
<user1> he sets it off to the side on a couch i think .
<user1> the lady sneezes at the start of the video
<user1> yes , the camera doesn 't move or rotate at all .
<user1> no just hungry , i think its a grilled cheese
<user1> no sound in this video

<user1> yes the video begins with the person standing in front of the door .
<user1> yes she reaches up to grab it and walks out of the closet and off camera .

<user1> she is definitely neutral throughout .
<user1> he stands up , grabs the broom then exits the room , to stand back in the doorway again .
<user1> no he doesn 't speak but he does sneeze .
<user1> the bag looked like a bag ofplain chips with no flavor .
<user1> yes i guess it looks soft enough .
<user1> he puts on his jacket
<user1> it is a medium size tv .
<user1> a man in the kitchen who opens up some cabinets .

<user1> a mirror in her left hand
<user1> a person is watching television and another person opens a refrigerator .
<user1> he is not dancing . he moves around the room a little bit .
<user1> no she picks it up later
<user1> he looks about 18 or so
<user1> yes , but hard to telll
<user1> no there is nothing else .
<user1> i am not sure . the boy is not clapping .
<user1> he 's holding the bag of groceries in his hands and opening the pantry door .
<user1> he brushes off the front of his hoodie .
<user1> yes , he is sitting on a chair in the bathroom .
<user1> he just sits there and does not talk on the phone . he looks around a little and grins once .

<user1> he 's holding on the his phone .
<user1> yes that 's right . neither say anything .
<user1> the woman walks out of the frame
<user1> the person in the video is a woman .
<user1> i would assume so since there is a bed
<user1> the person is standing in the middle of a room and begins walking
<user1> a man is on his bed reading a book and then lying down .
<user1> he puts a clear bag in the table , but i can not tell what is in the bag .
<user1> a man is looking out a window
<user1> that is all that happens in the video .
<user1> i can not tell what she is stirring in the pot .
<user1> no , he does not speak , just smiles once
<user1> i think he is in his bedroom .
<user1> yes , a bunch of background noise
<user1> not after she starts . she keeps taking more
<user1> then he 's trying to put a shirt onto a mop .
<user1> well if it is in a third world country it is rather clean for that .
<user1> yes i hear the sounds of him moving the items .
<user1> i can 't really tell if he 's looking directly at the pillow .
<user1> it is a regular plastic shopping bag .
<user1> yes she is the only one .

<user1> he speaks to her first
<user1> a manis speaking on the phone
<user1> yes , 2 people in the video
<user1> not really , a man is in his kitchen getting ready to eat .
<user1> i 'm weirded out to say , possibly his bathroom .
<user1> at the end he closes the laptop and leaves the scene
<user1> yes , a woman speaks in a foreign language , at the beginning of the video only .
<user1> no , nothing was on the stool before he started placing items there .
<user1> commonly when people describe movies and film , the describe " frame " to mean what is in the picture , thus the man is not framing anything , just walking in a room after opening a curtain .
<user1> no but you can see a black dog in the video through the open door .
<user1> there is only one person in the video
<user1> no he keeps the glasses in his hand
<user1> yes , she is rolling a math in the floor
<user1> has int left until the video is finished
<user1> you cant really tell but it seems something caught his attention
<user1> looks more like she is making a mess .
<user1> no , that is all that happens .
<user1> yes , there is sound in the video .
<user1> he is resting on a desk and eating a sandwich
<user1> yes , when the video starts , he enters through the door .
<user1> yep , and then got startled awake
<user1> never a sound or a noise .
<user1> then . he puts his hands down on the couch by his sides as if he 's pushing himself to stand and the video ends .
<user1> he continues flipping through the book and then picks up a towel .
<user1> no , no sound , only the drawer
<user1> yes , the text says play the game .
<user1> he looks happy to me

<user1> he 's the only one visible
<user1> the mirror is attached to the wall
<user1> yes he is and he is naked from the waist down
<user1> no , he doesn 't cough or sneeze .
<user1> he puts some stuff from the counter away .
<user1> the bed is 1/2 feet away from the closet .
<user1> she shakes out the jacket and starts folding it , then the video ends .
<user1> no , i couldn 't see inside . it is a small box .
<user1> he should be in his 40s
<user1> no , she is in the same place the whole time .
<user1> only once he starts to take out the groceries from the bag and put them on the table
<user1> it looks like a basement .
<user1> the two talk , but i don 't know if it is to each other
<user1> no , he doesn 't speak . only laughs at one point
<user1> probably around 25 years old .
<user1> no , it 's only him in the video .

<user1> no i dont see any thing
<user1> first he sweeps around the kitchen with an odd looking broom , then he eats something .

<user1> no , he does not speak at all , only laughs .
<user1> looks like a messy garage .
<user1> it is brunette or brown
<user1> yes , there is only one person .
<user1> neither , he looks very content .
<user1> no they arent just waking up ?
<user1> yes , they are seen throughout the entire video .
<user1> i don 't think so because he stirs something in the pan then puts the spoon he used back in the silverware drawer .
<user1> he is in a bathroom .
<user1> she doesn 't drink from the cup
<user1> no , he was here at the start of the scene .
<user1> i can 't really tell i think he is just relaxing .

<user1> the man uses a broom to sweep the room .
<user1> after taking it off he throws it on the bed
<user1> i think its a bedroom .

<user1> yes there is one boy in the hallway
<user1> i can not tell , but because she is so young i am going to assume daytime .

<user1> he also exits out of that door into a bedroom .
<user1> he does not . he opens the cabinet and lays a blanket down

<user1> the were just plain blue plates . probably ceramic .

<user1> there are two people in the video
<user1> a lawn chair , lot of cheep furniure

<user1> she places the groceries on the table
<user1> yes , the video ends with him opening the fridge

<user1> at the beginning he 's holding a laptop and a book .
<user1> he uses the remote , smiles .
<user1> no he does not do that

<user1> no she doesn 't do any laundry .
<user1> he is holding a camera in the end .
<user1> there is no way to tell how much of his reading was completed . no pages were flipped .

<user1> no there is no sound in the video .
<user1> the woman is sitting on a pillow drinking from a bottle . the man picks up a plastic bag and walks by the female .
<user1> not really . it 's just strange that he 's just sitting there snuggling with a pillow .

<user1> it ends with him sitting , and drinking his coffee .
<user1> yes he is already holding it .

<user1> it doesn 't appear that he is looking for anything , he is just putting his computer in his bag and organizing his bag .
<user1> she just walks towards the camera a bit and that is it .
<user1> she opens a cupboard and then closes it as she laughs

<user1> he grabs a box and then starts walking toward the camera
<user1> no he is sitting in a recreation room .

<user1> no only the pill bottle .
<user1> i can hear the car scraping on the floor but nothing else .
<user1> two men are on a bed , one in the front eats chips then later drinks water , while the man laying behind him talks on the phone a lot while laying down , is mostly the process of events .
<user1> she is putting some things in a bin and looks and laughs at an item
<user1> a towel is on his lap
<user1> there are two females in the video
<user1> i can hear both the audio and the man 's laughter . the couch he 's sitting on has a red cover .
<user1> no , just a dull look

<user1> they are alone during it
<user1> it 's on the whole time
<user1> yes , i think it 's a bedroom .

<user1> he was only looking indifrent through out the video
<user1> no he does not speak during the video
<user1> he never returns he just disappears into the dark closet
<user1> i think we covered everything . you could ask about sound .
<user1> just footstep and white noise
<user1> no just that he closes the box afterwards .
<user1> just post up looks at the food inside and goes to re loop around
<user1> there is one person in the video .

<user1> he is holding a blanket and then puts it in the closet .
<user1> he runs up some stairs and sits then picks up a bag and comes back down .
<user1> there is no direct way to tell , but it seems like a bedroom .
<user1> no , i don 't see a door .
<user1> just one is shown in the video .
<user1> we don 't know why he pushes his shoes against the wall
<user1> no , he doesn 't speak the whole time
<user1> no , i think there may be someone off screen , because you hear a door squeak closed .

<user1> no he is just on camera after finishing reading something funny on his documents , perhaps story of some sort

<user1> he is standing in a room looking at his phone laughing . he walks to the table , turns on a light , sets his phone down and takes a sip from a coffee mug
<user1> there are no indications of which room they are open , but it looks like they are inside of a home in an open corridor earea .
<user1> he doesn 't finish it , he threw it down and ran off at the end .
<user1> only one person is in the video
<user1> a person appears to be using a mop to mop his kitchen floor quickly . he than stops to take his shoes off and laughs hysterically .

<user1> he is the only star of the show .
<user1> he walks in looking down and around , while eating a box of crackers

<user1> she walks in carrying a plastic grocery bag and takes a sandwich bag with a sandwich out of the grocery bag .
<user1> he picks up a broom

<user1> there is no change of emotion .
<user1> i heard some background noise at beginning of someone talking .
<user1> with a purpose but he pours some on the floor before he drinks it

<user1> i would say thirty to thirty-five .
<user1> just background noise i heard
<user1> at the beginning he pours coffee into the mug .
<user1> bedroom looks a little messy .
<user1> the book appears to be soft covered
<user1> he goes to a picture on the wall
<user1> then she picks up the cup and takes a sip .
<user1> it 's a man walking into a room
<user1> she never sits . the whole time she is at the sink cleaning which appears to be a dish .
<user1> there is only one man in the video
<user1> there are pots on the stove , but i don 't know if there 's food in them .
<user1> she goes over to the bed where clothes are on the bed and puts on her jacket and keeps it on the whole time , and then goes back to her chair and opens laptop and starts typing .

<user1> he does not seem angry one bit .
<user1> he actually puts the magazine in the sink , pours liquid on it , and then everyone laughs . then the video ends .
<user1> it looks like it is dark brown .
<user1> then she seems a bit surprised by the voice
<user1> he leaves the room through what appears to be a front door
<user1> there is someone behind him , but in the far background in one of the other rooms . this appears to be more of a commercial building than residential .
<user1> than she starts throwing some clothes on the floor and laughing
<user1> his hair is wet in the end .
<user1> he starts off in the room .
<user1> no he is still making the sandwich at the end of the video .

<user1> no he doesn 't . he is just holding it in his hands .
<user1> i do not see any windows as he runs around the room .

<user1> there is not enough information in this video to determine that .
<user1> he does not sneeze throughout the entire video .
<user1> she puts detergent in the washer . then sit down on a chair and picks up a broom
<user1> maybe that 's what they are , it is hard to tell .
<user1> she turns the camera on .
<user1> no , in the beginning he took them off , but then he went and put them back on .
<user1> all you see is the back of it 's ears and top of the back of it 's head but it looks small and like a yorkie maybe
<user1> the man walks into the apartment , then he puts his phone on the table , and then begins to watch a televsion show . he stays standing and laughing at the tv unti l the video ends .

<user1> he is throwing some clothes down the steps

<user1> no , just the sandwich , although it looks like he is cooking something at the stove
<user1> no , one is talking in the clip

<user1> it looks like it is water poured from a pitcher .
<user1> after picking up the remote , he walks over to a television mounted on the wall .
<user1> there is a small digital screen on the right , looks like one of those photo display frames .
<user1> no it does not show him put clothes in the washer , it does show him take them out .
<user1> she sweeps around in that little corner for a few seconds and then she picks up a blanket from the laundry basket .
<user1> the video is of a man waking up over the stove with a bottle in his hands , then starts cooking .
<user1> i think maybe just a corner of maybe a study .
<user1> no he just stood behind the shoes .
<user1> no she left it open there
<user1> no he does not look at himself .
<user1> she 's snuggling in bed and watching tv

<user1> about 30 seconds it is
<user1> he seems content enough but it 's hard to tell .
<user1> it sounds like maybe papers
<user1> more than 5 things are hung on the walls , there is also the calender and the picture above the calendar .
<user1> it is bright in the room but with out being able to see out a window i can not tell ,
<user1> there is a small mirror on the wall

<user1> she starts off in the chair looking at a mirror , then she gets up and puts groceries away .
<user1> no he just keeps putting groceries away .
<user1> he does not ever leave the room
<user1> it appears to be a home office or maybe a den .
<user1> the quality is pretty bad and i can 't see expressions , but he seems neutral at worst from what i can tell
<user1> he puts it on a chair or something the scene is pretty dark so it is hard to tell

<user1> a child from off camera was speaking .
<user1> it looks like a shoe box .

<user1> the man also standing a write home work
<user1> just the one piece and then he goes
<user1> he is eating some snacks and takes a sip from a drink
<user1> it is a mirror with a light .
<user1> he is kind of a cram color
<user1> with the man sneezing sitting in the chair and the women talking
<user1> some parts of it is dark .
<user1> he might be taking something out in the beginning and putting it in his mouth , but then he folds it up so it must be empty .

<user1> he does not sit back down
<user1> no , just goes around the bed .
<user1> after the woman throws the pillow , the pillow falls to the ground . the older lady just stands there and laughs after .
<user1> no that 's pretty much it
<user1> its so hard to tell
<user1> i am unsure , as the video is dimly lit and sideways . it looks like he may have been attempting to pick the coat up .
<user1> another young boy walks past the kid folding laundry and grabs something off the kitchen counter .
<user1> no , she does not talk .
<user1> jsut one dude is in the video
<user1> i am not sure why

<user1> she holds up a book and backs away slowly watching the camera and turns on the lamp

<user1> she turns on the light and begins going through a box .
<user1> she opens it , then sets it on the dresser to assemble .

<user1> it looks to be youtube
<user1> as the guy is sitting you can se someone 's legs walk by down the hall . tha 'ts not really imporatnt , but the sitting guy evntually stands up and turns to the camera and the video ends

<user1> he is walking towards a house .
<user1> she sets them on top of the washer and doesn 't touch them for the rest of the video

<user1> the woman is walking down the steps .
<user1> at the beginning , you can just see the tv

<user1> no animals in the video
<user1> beginning and middle it happens .

<user1> he turns the film advance knob and sort of examines the camera front and back .
<user1> he stays in the room the entire time

<user1> he finally is able to get his shoes off and sets them down out of view .

<user1> there is only the one person
<user1> she comes into the room , pour some beverage into the glass and smile at the phone and leaves the room
<user1> no , there are two people .
<user1> it looks like a crack house or some type of derelict building
<user1> she is picking up a box and putting it in a cabinet
<user1> no there is no one else .
<user1> no , he is just looking at the screen and taking notes .
<user1> he is sleeping on the stairs .
<user1> no i think it had already finished the whole cycle
<user1> it looks like a yellow jar he is using it as a tool to hit the window frame .
<user1> no he just picks up a glass and washes it
<user1> she is standing in a hallway holding a sandwich .
<user1> i am not sure as it wasn 't in view

<user1> she is sitting there playing on her cell phone as she waits for the microwave to finish .
<user1> the guy is just standing there with a smile on his face holding his laptop .
<user1> no , she has it in her hand for the entire video
<user1> he picks up his water bottle off of the floor and opens it .
<user1> yes , he is eating a bag of snacks
<user1> maybe 16 years old it seems like
<user1> he puts the plate back down
<user1> no , he holds the plate while he looks for something in the fridge .
<user1> he also grabs a bag of chips from the ground and eats a chip out of it before he puts the box away .
<user1> no he covered with the paper he is holding onto .
<user1> no they do not look nervous
<user1> yes she is studing in it
<user1> yes while standing at the sink
<user1> first thing he did was to remove his hoodie .
<user1> a person is in a living room sitting and snuggling on a blanket
<user1> it appears to be a living room or a home office .
<user1> yes , walks to the fridge and then walks back to the pot
<user1> a person is opening up her refrigerator to tidy it up
<user1> no he does not say anything , he just sneezes
<user1> she just set them on the counter and continued taking stuff out of the fridge
<user1> he sits both of them on the floor beside him .
<user1> he fixes the sheet on the bed and then puts the pillows back at the top
<user1> nope that is about the jist of the video
<user1> she is in her joggers
<user1> no he actually doesnot open the closet at all , he just walks over to it .
<user1> that is all that happens
<user1> he is already in the room .
<user1> yes , she is laughing for most of the video .
<user1> well the guy is looking out the window , holding a sandwich and a hanger , takes a bite off his sandwich and removes the curtain and opens the window .
<user1> no , there is audio but it is only background white noise .
<user1> she grabs a black jacket and puts it on then she sits down in the chair
<user1> there is some audio but cannot make out what is said
<user1> he is wearing a pair of ripped dark colored jeans .
<user1> when he was walking out of the dinning room
<user1> it starts with him reading a book
<user1> yes he has the glass in his right hand
<user1> no he does not ever look at the camera
<user1> she grabs them and throw them on the floor .
<user1> i think it is an aquarium
<user1> if i had to guess i would say mid to late thirties .
<user1> no , they don 't open any other doors .
<user1> he walks into the screen and starts cleaning a cabinet .
<user1> she starts cleaning the bed .
<user1> you can hear some people talking .
<user1> no just lots of ringtone listening
<user1> i can hear background noise .
<user1> the man can be seen for the whole video .
<user1> no he does not leave the room totally . just starts leaving at the end .
<user1> they are laying down most of the time
<user1> she grabs a jacket and turn on the light and begin to wear the jacket .
<user1> not at first , but he does when he puts his shoes on
<user1> from what i can see maybe peanut butter .
<user1> no . all he 's doing is sitting and tying the shoelaces on his shoes .
<user1> no , he actually puts clothes into the backpack
<user1> only one person is in the video .
<user1> he is alone in the scene .
<user1> he takes a sip from a mug
<user1> it depends on the book , i guess . it 's hard to really tell without being able to see the book better .
<user1> hard to tell but looks like envelopes and a jar of something .
<user1> nothing else important than that
<user1> yes , i hear camera static noise
<user1> no she doesnt put anything in the machine
<user1> no , there is some clutter on the counters too .
<user1> yes has the book the entire time .
<user1> they seem to be a very happy pair . he smiles alot .
<user1> she is definitely dressing for winter .
<user1> at the start of the video the man is sitting on a chair reading a book .
<user1> just one person . i think it 's a young man .
<user1> it is dark in the room so i can 't tell .
<user1> no , they are sitting the whole time
<user1> it appears to be light blue and grey
<user1> i can hear music playing in the background .
<user1> he does . he begins to watch a tv show , and laughs loudly and repeatedly .
<user1> yes you can see her face .
<user1> no noise at all which is a little creepy .
<user1> he is a young man .
<user1> he picks it up off the table .
<user1> looks like a livingroom maybe
<user1> a person puts a cup down and grabs shoes out of a box then puts them on
<user1> no , she just sits on it as its available for anyone to sit .
<user1> she walks thru and leaves .
<user1> yes that was what he did
<user1> yes you can hear the man speak to the cameraman
<user1> just the once , but he is holding these items as he is sneezing , so they are occuring simultaneously .
<user1> no , he never gets up
<user1> back where he came from i could not tell
<user1> he is sitting at a desk taking sips from a small glass of water .
<user1> no he does not speak , just laughs
<user1> a male and a female are standing across from each other . the female is staring at the guy and the male is holding a vacuum looking down .
<user1> she stays on the couch the rest of the time
<user1> there is just one guy
<user1> looks like it is daytime , but hard to tell inside
<user1> he 's already there when the video begins .
<user1> yes she is there throughout the video
<user1> the man is wearing a bathrobe .
<user1> he goes to another website but i can 't tell what it is .
<user1> no he is in this one room the whole time .
<user1> he may be around 30
<user1> it appears to be the kitchen .
<user1> no , he never sits back down .
<user1> a teenager in a living room , throws a towel and blanket on the ground and leaves
<user1> he came back in then sat the bag back on the bed . maybe he 's confused ?
<user1> she puts laundry in the bag .
<user1> he did not react to anything , he sneezed a couple of times
<user1> she puts the bag in the box and fiddles with trying to tape the box shut for most of the video .
<user1> one person is running to the phone
<user1> he sets the magazines down onto the table .
<user1> a man opens a door , walks into another room , then begins to wash dishes .
<user1> just out in the open
<user1> no cleaning that i see . just before the video ends she walks away toward the sink . you can see her backside in the mirror so she is still in the bathroom
<user1> he stands up and opens the door and then sits back down and stares towards the right
<user1> i think he sneezes twice
<user1> yes , he 's wearing sweat pants and a tshirt .
<user1> there is no talking at all
<user1> not sure . he reads a few pagees of the book then looks at his phone
<user1> the video ends with him stirring what he 's cooking .
<user1> i can 't really tell , but it does have a bed i think in there so maybe it is .
<user1> dirty it seems he didn 't use soap just rinsing with water .
<user1> he walks away and waves to the camera .
<user1> she 's standing in the room with her dog
<user1> it is unclear how many bottles are in the package .
<user1> he just continues to tidy up the shelf .
<user1> i 'd say probably early twenties to early thirties , hard to tell ; he 's got good skin ..
<user1> it is daytime . bright and sunny .
<user1> no he goes up to the camera to turn it off
<user1> walkoing out of a kitchen into a dining room maybe .
<user1> no , there is no one else in the room .
<user1> no , the man was alone in the video .
<user1> no he does not clean the dust .
<user1> no , she doesn 't turn it off at the end .
<user1> yes , he was holding the broom at the beginning of the video
<user1> possibly but it is unclear what they say .
<user1> no , he wasn 't really sick , the sneezes were fake . well the first sneeze may have been real , but the second was definitely fake .
<user1> she appears to be cleaning the shower .
<user1> probably in their twenties or around there .
<user1> there is no voice in video
<user1> no he doesn 't do any of those he doesn 't even say anything
<user1> yes he does eat what he grabs out of the bowl
<user1> no the screen is black but it is plugged in and charging .
<user1> it looks as though he eats a cookie .
<user1> no it appears to be in pill form .
<user1> they are indeed playing cards .
<user1> the man is sitting on a chair while looking at a laptop .
<user1> i believe they are chips .
<user1> no , his back is always to us and he actually puts 3 things away but i can 't tell what the 3rd thing is .
<user1> just the sounds of him walking and fiddling with his water .
<user1> the only noise you here is muffle from the tv .
<user1> i 'm pretty sure they both are . the one with green hair might be a younger girl .
<user1> i think he is just comfortable
<user1> the video ends with her looking down at her lap wiping off the cocoa .
<user1> he picks up a bottle of medicine
<user1> no , i dont think so
<user1> he grabs a broom and starts sweeping with it
<user1> no , she doesn 't eat or drink .
<user1> he covers himself with the blanket
<user1> yes there is only one man in the video
<user1> the show off in front of the mirror

<user1> another lady walks into the room grabs dishes and a pillow
<user1> she closes the door and leaves the room .
<user1> no , he just stands there
<user1> he seems to be pretty awake .
<user1> the sound of the tv is heard in the background
<user1> it looks like it is in the living room .
<user1> no he doesn 't say anything
<user1> with both of them still standing there .
<user1> no he just kind of moves stuff around in there and then goes to the door to leave
<user1> yes , in the beginning of the video she is holding the box
<user1> he is undressing and then dressing while eating a sandwich in the beginning .
<user1> maybe late 20 ' s or so

<user1> he stays in the room
<user1> he is trying to setup a tie
<user1> he doesn 't watch tv but he does play a game on his phone
<user1> no , the man cleans the steps from floor level .
<user1> it 's really hard to tell what room it is .
<user1> the person is sitting on the floor wrapped in a blanket
<user1> he is a man in the video .
<user1> the mans hair is dark brown
<user1> it is a man inside the video .
<user1> no he just adjusted it on the top of washer

<user1> he took it from his pocket
<user1> they look to be in their late 40 ' s
<user1> yes he does look towards the camera .
<user1> she is touching a blanket and then she is talking on the phone .

<user1> it 's a young guy in the video
<user1> no but there is very loud traffic and honking heard .
<user1> he sits in a chair and is typing on the keyboard of his laptop .
<user1> at the end he is turning the light switch on and off .
<user1> no , he just holds the camera
<user1> yes he takes the lid off the pot and stirs it .
<user1> yes , and he stayed at he same spot from start to end .
<user1> he is reading a book and flipping through a notebook .

<user1> yes . he is eating the food that in his hands
<user1> no it is just the one man in the video .
<user1> no he stays in the same room
<user1> just the sound of him rustling the plastic bag his is holding .
<user1> it 's hard to tell what kind of room the shot is not wide enough
<user1> he took three handfuls of chips only while he was standing at the end of the hallway .
<user1> i cannot , but i assume it is during the morning .
<user1> he grabs a cloth and starts dusting the small one
<user1> no , she walks back in , closes door and goes and turns off camera .
<user1> them still throwing and catching
<user1> he is in the room alone
<user1> it does not show him in the video the whole time , but it does not show him leaving the room either .

<user1> no , he stands up part way through and begins to walk down the hall .
<user1> the man is eating and then stacks some dishes .

<user1> after he places the shoes under the desk he grabs a phone or camera and takes a picture of the shoes .
<user1> no she does not sweep
<user1> she is cleaning up room by moving clothes , straightening a picture on the wall and moving a table .
<user1> it looks like he 's got a pocket or holder on the arm of the chair . he takes it from there .
<user1> i really don ` t know , looks like a changing room from a gym .
<user1> no , he is just holding it up in the air .
<user1> he took a pillows in his hands
<user1> yes shes speaking about meeting up with someone very soon
<user1> no just those two people

<user1> no . it stays open after she opened it .
<user1> no , nothing else that we haven 't already covered .
<user1> no i really only see his forehead and kind of his eyes in the mirror
<user1> after looking through the notebook he walks out of the room slowly ( while still flipping pages )
<user1> at the beginning it looks like he is off to the side before walking to the box and broom ?
<user1> no i dont any thing
<user1> after he spilled the water on the bed , while he was standing up , he spoke with the video taker . that 's the only time they talk .
<user1> no there is a guy and a girl on a couch eating grapes
<user1> yes i think his daughter
<user1> the mess was already there so he did not spill anything .
<user1> no she just closes it

<user1> i cant really tell what the picture is
<user1> there is only one person in the video ?
<user1> yes , he smiles a little when he opens the laptop .
<user1> yes , she pays particular attention to the eye area .
<user1> could be a basement , it 's a lower ground level you can tell by the daylight
<user1> she puts a light bulb in a light after climbing up a stool or something to reach it .
<user1> the video ended before he could
<user1> one is holding groceries and the other comes in and takes some of the groceries
<user1> yep , half way through . he gets up from he couch .
<user1> he is walking to his home office and sitting at his chair before his computer .
<user1> if you 're refereing to the last scene , he has stopped sweeping , shut off the bathroom light and has walked out of the bath and into a different room .
<user1> not completely clear . seems like a finished basement .
<user1> a woman in a hallway sweeping .
<user1> i can see one woman
<user1> yes he does seem happy
<user1> he takes a plate and glass off of the counter or table .
<user1> she moves around on the couch

<user1> no she does not talk
<user1> he picks up a plastic bag from the dining room table .
<user1> no , he just stands and stares at the tv and then the camera pans to the left .
<user1> hard to tell , but it looks like it is when the sun is still out .
<user1> no he is a man ... maybe effeminate but definitely a man
<user1> there is one person in the video .
<user1> no , not pills , but a bottle of medicine .
<user1> with him just standing there staring .
<user1> no he picks it up when he enters the living room .
<user1> just like a normal sneeze , neither reallly quiet nor rewally loud
<user1> a man is alone , and stands in front of a stove , with a mug , and drinks from it , while moving a pan back and forth on a stove top .
<user1> no he does not do anything else .

<user1> he is sweeping the floor with a broom
<user1> she is in the room the whole time .
<user1> he has a towel and a backpack
<user1> its night time in the video
<user1> i would say he is mid to late 20 ' s
<user1> no nothing else stands out .
<user1> there is only one peraon
<user1> if i had to guess itis some kind of entry way some kind of small sitting are
<user1> it 's hard to tell , but it is roundish and is pink
<user1> he takes a long slow drink from it while still sitting on his bed .

<user1> he does not eat the whole thing , but eats a lot of it .
<user1> she puts the laptop on the desk .
<user1> no he doesn 't as far as i can tell .
<user1> no , she does nothing with her hair .
<user1> she starts doing some jumping jacks , then she walks over to the bed , picks up a book , sits for a minute then run out the room
<user1> it is a hallway at the entryway of the building .
<user1> no , that about covers everything .
<user1> that is correct order of events
<user1> no , i am not sure which language they are speaking .
<user1> i can 't see a sink .
<user1> yes . this is correct . the man is the there the entire time during the video .
<user1> no just pours it in glass and lays it back on table
<user1> she looks neutral . she does stare at the camera a few times .
<user1> some box and tools and a cat
<user1> just a buzzing sound , like white noise .
<user1> she sneezes and covers her face with her hand
<user1> it seems like it , yes .
<user1> she is not having dinner , she just walksinto the dining room in the beginning

<user1> no it is a foreign language .
<user1> he is sitting at a table eating a sandwich and drinking coffee .
<user1> no , he collects them in his hand
<user1> yes , i think there was a chair in the video
<user1> he was putting box on table and walk
<user1> when she closed the door it was a hallway , but it is kind of one multiporpose room , kitchen and living room .
<user1> that 's a very real possibility but i don 't know .
<user1> like she is cleaning it up .
<user1> the man does stare at the camera , but does not speak directly to them or interact with them .
<user1> it looks like it is a puffy coat
<user1> yes , it appears he does .
<user1> yes she does walk into the room
<user1> he appears to be white .
<user1> a man sitting at a table and drinking a glass of water is at the beginning of the video .
<user1> yes , there is a sound of a woman that is not seen in the video .
<user1> i honestly really only see her from the back .
<user1> the person is a woman .
<user1> there is only one person in that can be seen in the video .
<user1> that is correct and puts it away nicely on the corner
<user1> that is the whole video . just a guy sitting and pouring tea and then studying a text book
<user1> no he does not drink anything .
<user1> it is brownish in color .
<user1> no , there 's no talking in the video

<user1> no the camera does not follow him .
<user1> i don 't see her typing .

<user1> yes , there is a bike in the background .
<user1> no . he just glances at the camera one and continues snacking and watching his show
