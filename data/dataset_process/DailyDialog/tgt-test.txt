<user1> Some what ?
<user0> Weed ! You know ? Pot , Ganja , Mary Jane some chronic !
<user1> Oh , umm , no thanks .
<user0> I also have blow if you prefer to do a few lines .
<user1> No , I am ok , really .
<user0> Come on man ! I even got dope and acid ! Try some !
<user1> Do you really have all of these drugs ? Where do you get them from ?
<user0> I got my connections ! Just tell me what you want and I ' ll even give you one ounce for free .
<user1> Sounds good ! Let ' s see , I want .
<user0> Yeah ?
<user1> I want you to put your hands behind your head ! You are under arrest !
<user1> What for ?
<user0> They want the government to reduce the price of the gasoline .
<user1> It is really a hot potato .
<user1> That's excellent . How have you managed that ?
<user0> Mainly because we've invested in a heat recovery system .
<user1> What does that mean exactly ?
<user0> Well , we use the exhaust gases from our printing presses to provide energy to heat our dryers .
<user1> What other sources of energy do you use ?
<user0> We don't use any fossil fuels . Most of our power comes from hydro-electric plants . We're hoping to use even more energy from alternative sources in the future - perhaps even wind power .
<user1> Well , people from Asia to Europe all enjoy tea .
<user0> Right . And China is the homeland of tea .
<user1> Yes , Chinese people love drinking tea so much . Some even claim they can't live without tea .
<user0> Do you know there are several catagories of Chinese tea ?
<user1> Yes , I believe there are green teas , black teas and scented teas . Any Others ?
<user0> Well , have you ever heard of Oulong tea and compressed tea ?
<user1> Oh , yeah . Oulong tea is good for one's health . isn't it ?
<user0> You surely know a lot about Chinese tea .
<user1> Sure , I like drinking tea at teahouses .
<user0> Oh , so do I .
<user1> Why don't we go for one now ?
<user0> Great . We can chat while enjoying a cup there .
<user1> Let's go !
<user1> I ' m afraid I ' m a poor talker . I ' m not comfortable talking with the people whom I have just met for the first time . That is not very good for business , so I have been studying public speaking .
<user0> Are you more of a leader or a follower ?
<user1> I don ' t try to lead people . I ' d rather cooperate with everybody , and get the job done by working together .
<user0> Do you think you can make yourself easily understood in English ?
<user1> Yes , in most circumstances .
<user0> Are you available for travel ?
<user1> Yes , I like travelling . I am young , and unmarried . It ' s no problem for me to travel frequently .
<user1> I think it ' s a distance of 180 kilometers from here to London , so it should be a two-hour drive on the motorway .
<user0> that ' s unless there is a traffic jam . It could take three hours .
<user1> you ' re right . We will be able to travel at high speeds at the beginning and end of the journey , because we will be in built-up areas .
<user0> so , shall we allow three hours to cover the distance ?
<user1> ok . You haven ' t seen my company car , have you ?
<user0> no . let me take a look ... it ' s longer than my car .
<user1> I think it ' s over five meters long . I can ' t remember exactly . It has a maximum speed of over 200 kilometers an hour .
<user0> wow ! That ' s fast ! I don ' t think we will be traveling that fast on the motorway .
<user1> we can ' t . if we went that fast , we would break the speed limit .
<user1> Do you want the truth ?
<user0> Of course , I do .
<user1> Well , you really didn't do all that well .
<user0> How bad did I do ?
<user1> To be completely honest , you failed your test .
<user0> How ?
<user1> There were a number of reasons .
<user0> What were they ?
<user1> Basically , you just can't drive .
<user0> Can I have another try ?
<user1> You can take it in a couple weeks .
<user1> Good morning , doctor . I have a terrible headache .
<user0> All right , young man . Tell me how it got started .
<user1> Yesterday I had a runny nose . Now my nose is stuffed up . I have a sore throat . And I ' m afraid I've got a temperature . I feel terrible .
<user0> Don't worry , young man . Lat me give you an examination . First let me take a look at your throat . Open your mouth and say'ah ' .
<user1> Ah .
<user0> Your throat is inflamed . And your tongue is heavily coated . You have all the symptoms of influenza .
<user1> What am I supposed to do then ?
<user0> A good rest is all you need , and drink more water . I'll write you a prescription .
<user1> Thank you very much .
<user1> Red cooked carp and rape with fresh mushrooms .
<user0> What about soup ?
<user1> Sour-peppery soup .
<user0> Which condiment do you use for ?
<user1> I'll use ginger , garlic scallion , hot pepper and vinegar .
<user0> Very good , need I help you ?
<user1> No , don't need , I can do myself .
<user0> Thanks . I can watch TV now .
<user1> But you must cook that dinner next time .
<user0> Okay , I'll do it next time .
<user1> Mike ! Good to hear from you . How are you ?
<user0> Everything is fine , and how are you ?
<user1> Things are going well with me .
<user0> Kara , I had fun the other night at the movies and was wondering if you would like to go out again this Friday .
<user1> Mike , I don't think that it's a good idea to go out again . I really need to focus on getting packed and ready to move back home .
<user0> Maybe we could just meet for coffee or something .
<user1> I can't really deal with any distractions right now , but I appreciate the nice evening we spent together .
<user1> Yes , I have booked a room for 24th . It's a double room .
<user0> Hold on , please . Let me check it for you . Yes , you're right . You will keep it for 3 days .
<user1> Well , now I want to change the date from 24th to 28th .
<user0> OK , that shall be arranged .
<user1> I'm free . What's up ?
<user0> Someone has to pick up the boss at the airport .
<user1> Oh , I just remembered I've got a report to write .
<user1> It's ten after six.We ' re late.But dinner is at six thirty .
<user0> I know . I know . I'm really sorry . I lost my bag .
<user1> I'll call the lost and found office .
<user0> I didn't think of it.Thank you.And I do apologize for being late .
<user1> Do you have the ' The man and the Sea ' by Ernest Hemingway ?
<user0> Yes , we have one copy left .
<user1> Can you hold it for me ?
<user1> Yes , here you are .
<user0> How much is it ?
<user1> It's free of charge .
<user0> Thanks so much .
<user1> No problem at all . Could I have your full name , please ?
<user0> Sure , John Sandals .
<user1> Hi , Mr . Sandals . I'm Michelle , at your service . When do you need the room ?
<user0> My plans are to be there April 14th to the 17th .
<user1> We have new room rates , sir . Will that be acceptable to you ?
<user0> Well , it depends on the price , of course . What is it ?
<user1> It's $ 308 a night .
<user0> I have no problem with that .
<user1> Great ! Would you prefer smoking or nonsmoking ?
<user0> Definitely nonsmoking . I can't handle that smell .
<user1> Nonsmoking . Now , is a queen-size bed okay ?
<user0> No problem .
<user1> Great , Mr . Sandals . Your reservation is confirmed . Now all I need is your phone number .
<user0> Of course ! It's area code 626-555-1739 .
<user1> Thank you so much , Mr . Sandals . We look forward to seeing you !
<user1> Certainly , sir .
<user0> I'm afraid there's been a mistake .
<user1> I'm sorry , sir . What seems to be the trouble ?
<user0> I believe you have charged me twice for the same thing . Look , the figure of 6.5 dollar appears here , then again here .
<user1> I'll just go and check it for you , sir .
<user1> Yes . I bought this sheet here yesterday .
<user0> Anything wrong with it ?
<user1> Yes . When I spread it out back home , I found this hole .
<user0> Oh , how awful ! May I have a look at the invoice ?
<user1> Here it is .
<user0> Well . please accept our sincere apologies , I'll be glad to change it for another one if you wish .
<user1> That's very kind of you . Thank you .
<user0> We're sorry that this has happened , and I guarantee that the same mistake won't happen again .
<user1> Perhaps you'd be interested in red roses .
<user0> What would the roses cost me ?
<user1> They're only $ 20 a dozen .
<user0> I like the sound of that .
<user1> Yes , that is today's sale price .
<user0> A dozen will be fine .
<user1> Is there anything else you'd like to get ?
<user0> No , thank you .
<user1> These roses should make your wife very happy .
<user1> Yes , I am afraid there are not enough outlets .
<user0> Well , we have 6 for each room .
<user1> Yes , but 4 of them are broken . Can you send someone here ?
<user0> OK sir , please wait a minute .
<user1> Are you aware that you drove through a red light ?
<user0> I ran a red light ?
<user1> Yes , you did .
<user0> I apologize , but I didn't realize that I did .
<user1> Weren't you taught that yellow means slow down , not speed up ?
<user0> I did learn that .
<user1> So , then why did you speed up ?
<user0> I don't know what to tell you .
<user1> I'm going to have to write you a ticket .
<user0> I understand .
<user1> Here you go . Don't do that again .
<user1> Surely of course .
<user0> Here is the film . Can I get my pictures tomorrow ?
<user1> Sure .
<user0> Besides I want two copies of all the photos .
<user1> My name is Dunlin and I live in Beijing . I was born in 1980 . I will graduate from Peking University this July . I have majored in accounting .
<user0> Would you tell me something about your family ?
<user1> There are three in my family , my parents and myself . My father is a teacher and my mother is a worker .
<user1> I have to start eating better too .
<user0> What kind of food do you usually eat ?
<user1> I try my best to eat only fruits , vegetables , and chicken .
<user0> Is that really all that you eat ?
<user1> That's basically it .
<user0> How do you stick to only those foods ?
<user1> Actually , fruits and veggies are really good for you .
<user0> Yeah , I know , but what about the chicken ?
<user1> I mainly eat baked chicken , because there's not a lot of fat .
<user0> That does sound pretty good .
<user1> I know it does , and that's because it is .
<user1> Could you show me where the Chinesc-style clothing is located ? I want to buy a silk coat .
<user0> This way , please . Here they are . They're all handmade .
<user1> Oh , they look nice . May I try that black one on ?
<user0> Of course . The fitting room is right over there .
<user1> Do you have a medium in the same color ? This one is a little tight .
<user0> l'm sorry . All the black of that size are sold out . Would you like a red one ?
<user1> OK . Let me try it on . What do you think ?
<user0> Oh , that suits you very well . Besides it is believed in China that the red color brings happiness and good luck .
<user1> Really ? I'II take it and I'm leaving here tomorrow . Is it possible for you to send one in black to me by mail when you get it in ?
<user0> Our pleasure . Please fill out this form , leaving your address and telephone number .
<user1> Thanks . How much would that come to ?
<user0> Let me see ...
<user1> Great , thanks .
<user0> Can I help you ?
<user1> I would actually like to view the apartment for rent today .
<user0> I ' m sorry , but you won ' t be able to view it today .
<user1> Why not ?
<user0> You have to make an appointment first .
<user1> Oh , okay . Can I do that right now ?
<user0> Is this Friday okay ?
<user1> Is 6 o ' clock Friday evening okay ?
<user0> Yes , I will schedule you for that time .
<user1> Thank you very much . See you then .
<user1> Thank you . I wonder whether I can enjoy the life insurance and health insurance .
<user0> Of course . A two-week paid vacation a year , a five-day workweek .
<user1> Good . Anything else ?
<user0> Yes , all the insurance will be linked with your work . We will issue an insurance policy .
<user1> Yes , I want to send a registered airmail letter to France .
<user0> Ok , it comes four dollars twenty cents .
<user1> Here is five dollars .
<user0> Here is your change . Please wait for your receipt of the registered mail .
<user1> I also want to pack up my package . This is the notes .
<user0> Let me see . En .. just a minute . Here it is . I need your signature on this note .
<user1> Oh , one more thing , where can I mail this letter ?
<user0> Drop it in the mail box mark out of town . at that corner .
<user1> Thank you very much .
<user0> You ‘ re welcome .
<user1> yeah , I'm glad that we didn't have to wait long . I'm starving !
<user0> let's take a look at the menu so we can order . Do you want to choose an appetizer for us to share ?
<user1> what would you rather have , samosas or poppadoms ?
<user0> I heard that one of their specialities is the samosa .
<user1> well , let's get a plate of those then .
<user0> sounds good . What are you going to have for your main course ?
<user1> I think I might have a dahl .
<user0> what's in a dahl ?
<user1> it's got chickpeas and vegetables in a spicy curry sauce with rice .
<user0> that sounds nice . Do you want to share some kebabs as well ?
<user1> ok . How about some lamb kebabs ?
<user0> that's my favourite . Do you want to have some wine or beer ?
<user1> I think I'll have a beer .
<user0> ok , shall I flag down the waitress ?
<user1> I wouldn't recommend it . I think we should wait until she comes round .
<user0> you're right . That might seem a bit rude . It's a good thing I've got you with me !
<user1> what would you do without me ?
<user1> Of course . I've loved writing since I was a very little boy . I won the first prize in a national composition contest when I was in middle school . After attending Nanjing University , I never give up writing . My works , such as Father's Tobacco Pipe , Open Air Cinema , The old City were respectively published China Youth Daily , Yangzi Evening News , and New Beijing . During the period of studying for my degrees of master and doctor , I paid more attention to developing my research ability and published several papers . The Impact of Internet in Chinese Political Participation , The Discipline of Remold , The Historical Direction of Chinese Administration Reform , Bribery Cases of Self governance in Chinese Villages are respectively published in Chinese Publish Administration , Beijing Due Xuebao , Theory and Society and Chinese Reform . I joined in Yangzi Evening News to work as a part-time journalist in 2006 . During this period , I've written a lot of comments , which improved my writing ability to a new level , I have full confidence in my writing ability , and I believe I can do the job well .
<user1> Yes , I'd like to reserve a table for dinner .
<user0> How large a group are you expecting ?
<user1> Six couples .
<user0> Would you like to reserve a private dining room ?
<user1> That sounds like a good idea .
<user0> All right . May I have your name , Sir ?
<user1> My name is Ron Kollwitz .
<user1> It's nice to meet you , Mr . Cooper .
<user0> Nice to meet you , Ms . Wang . You must be exhausted after your long trip from Canada .
<user1> Yes , it was quite a long flight . I'm glad to finally be here .
<user1> No , but I'll be able to tomorrow .
<user0> That'll be too late .
<user1> Why don't you ask Bill if he can help ?
<user0> I did , but he wasn't able to either .
<user1> Yes , I have been working in the Public Relations Section of a company in the past two years . I plan the advertising campaign and cooperate the work of artists and typographers . Sometimes I have to do the work of a specialist when there ' s something urgent .
<user0> Do you have any practical experience as a secretary ?
<user1> Yes , sir . I acted as a secretary in an insurance company .
<user0> Would you tell me the essential qualities a secretary should maintain ?
<user1> Well , to begin with , I would say she needs to be diligent , and the second point is that she has to do a lot of things on her own initiative . Finally , she can make notes in shorthand and types and has the skills in report writing , summary writing , keep minutes at meetings , and so on . Most important of all is that she seems to have a better memory than average .
<user0> Have you had any experience with computer ?
<user1> Yes , I studied in a computer training program , and can process data through the computer .
<user0> That's fine . What about operating the fax and duplicator ?
<user1> I can handle them without any trouble
<user0> What have you learned from jobs you have held ?
<user1> Above all , I have learned that what is good for the company is good for me . So I follow the instructions strictly and always keep my boss informed .
<user0> Very good .
<user1> Where have you been ? I've been trying to get in touch with you for two days .
<user0> I went to Salt Lake City on business . What's up ?
<user1> I got fired .
<user0> How come ? Last time I saw you . You told me it was a good job , and you'd like to take it as a career . That was only one month ago . Why this sudden change ?
<user1> It's a long story . In a word , I didn't do a good job of it . I messed up a business deal , a deal that would have made ten million dollars and I messed it up .
<user0> What are you going to do now ?
<user1> I am trying to find a job asap . Lily doesn't know yet . I didn't tell her . I spent the past three days at the coffee shop next to your office , and she thought I went to work as usual .
<user0> That's not the way to solve the problem . Did you look in the classified advertisements column ?
<user1> Yes , I did . But I wasn't qualified for most of the jobs that I was interested in .
<user0> Listen . I will see what I can do , ok ? You go home and tell Lily about this problem you have now . She is your wife and I am sure she will understand .
<user1> I just don't know how to bring it up . Well , all right . She has the right to know anyways .
<user1> I've never gotten one . Have you ?
<user0> I got a ticket yesterday .
<user1> Really ? What did you get one for ?
<user0> I parked in the red zone .
<user1> Why did you do that ?
<user0> I needed to get something really quick .
<user1> Where did you park at ?
<user0> At my apartment building .
<user1> Don't you have your own parking spot ?
<user0> I needed to be fast .
<user1> That was very lazy of you .
<user1> I ' m having a problem .
<user0> What problem are you having ?
<user1> There have been charges made on my debit card that I didn ' t make .
<user0> Do you have the statement for your card ?
<user1> Here it is .
<user0> What are the charges you ' re referring to ?
<user1> The last four charges on the page .
<user0> I ' m afraid we ' re going to have to investigate these charges .
<user1> How long will an investigation take ?
<user0> I honestly don ' t know , but we will freeze payment on these charges .
<user1> That sounds absolutely fantastic .
<user1> I don't know . Can I purchase Treasury Certificates here at this counter ?
<user0> Yes , of course . We have Treasury Notes with two , three and five-year terms available .
<user1> Two years is fine , with a value of 1,000 RIB .
<user0> OK , could I take a look at some ID please , like a passport ?
<user1> Here you go . By the way , is it possible to cash them before the maturity comes up ?
<user0> No , I'm afraid that isn't possible . You must wait until maturity before you cash them .
<user1> I am not cheating . When you pass go , you collect $ 200 , Everyone knows that !
<user0> Well you can ' t just take the money . You have to ask the bank for money . And I ' m the banker .
<user1> Banker ?
<user0> Yes ...
<user1> Can I have my $ 200 please ?
<user0> Sure . Here you are , $ 200 , Thank you , please come again ! Now it ' s my turn to roll the dice .
<user1> This is Professor Clark speaking .
<user0> Hi , this is Kalina from your morning literature class .
<user1> Yes , what can I do for you ?
<user0> I had a skydiving accident over the weekend and won ' t be able to come to school today .
<user1> My goodness ! Are you OK ?
<user0> I broke my leg , but it is healing .
<user1> How long will you be out of class ?
<user0> I should be able to return by next Monday .
<user1> Fine . Well , thanks for calling and letting me know you will be absent . I hope you feel better soon .
<user1> Yes , yes I did . Please come in ! I ' m so glad you came ! This old house is falling apart ! Come on into the bathroom . See , here , there ' s water leaking everywhere !
<user0> I see . Let me have a look . It seems that your toilet is clogged , and that ' s why it won ' t flush . Let me just get my plunger . No , that ' s not working either . I suspect that there ' s some sort of foreign object in the pipes that ‘ s causing a blockage . That ' s what ' s making your toilet overflow .
<user1> Oh , that must be because of my four-year-old daughter . She is always flushing things down the toilet . You know how kids are .
<user0> Yeah , I have a little one myself . Anyway , these water pipes are really rusty , so they also should be changed . Thatcould be causing water to not drain completely , that might lead to more problems in the future . I would also suggest fixing this faucet that isn ' t shutting off properly . I could have it all finished by today if it ' s urgent .
<user1> That would be great ! Is it expensive ?
<user0> Let ' s see ... I would say about eight hundred dollars .
<user1> I'm glad to help you . What's wrong ?
<user0> My mother-in-law just went into the hospital in L.A.Hank and I will be flying there tonight .
<user1> I'm sorry to hear it . What's wrong with her ?
<user0> Doctors aren't sure yet.But the real problem is Suzy . She has a bad cold , and we don't want to take her with us . But we don't know who can stay with her .
<user1> You need a babysitter .
<user0> Yes , I'd ask Jill , the girl I've had before , but I need someone overnight.Maybe even for two nights .
<user1> I could have Suzy stay at my place .
<user0> I don't want to do that to you , Karen .
<user1> Why not ?
<user0> Your own kids would get Suzy's cold . I think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . But I don't know who to ask . I need someone more mature than Jill . It might even be for two or three days .
<user1> I know who we can ask . There is a girl I know , Sara Ralston.She is 17 , and she will usually take this kind of job . I know her from my church , and I trust her completely .
<user0> I'd like to talk with her.This is short notice , I know . But Hank and I are leaving tonight .
<user1> I'll get you her number . I hope she can do it . She is very responsible .
<user0> I'm glad you know someone . I knew you would be the best person to ask about this . I don't want to insult Jill or her mother . I think Jill maybe could do it.But I'd rather have someone a little older .
<user1> I'll go home and get Sara's number . I'll call her first myself .
<user0> Great . Then call me and let me know if she's free .
<user1> I'd like a beer . What kind of beer do you have ?
<user0> Draft beer and cans beer . Which do you prefer ?
<user1> A draft beer please .
<user0> OK . Here you are .
<user1> Could I have some fruit ?
<user0> Of course . Wait for a moment , please .
<user1> Fine , thank you , and how are you ?
<user0> Very well , thank you . It's nice to meet you again . I am awfully sorry for not being able to meet you at the airport , as I was busy yesterday . I do hope you had a very enjoyable trip from New York .
<user1> Yes , a very pleasant journey indeed . Thank you .
<user0> How are you getting along with your business ?
<user1> Not bad . The fur market is not very brisk lately , but the selling season is advancing near . I hope there will be more buyers in the market this year .
<user0> I hope we can do more business together . Though we are satisfied with our past trade record , there are still possibilities for more business . In the meantime , let's discuss other spheres of cooperation , such as investment , technology transfer and technical assistance .
<user1> Toilets are in the rear , I am afraid all the toilets are fully occupied at the moment .
<user0> What ? Oh , what we live ! Thank you very much for your help , miss .
<user1> You are welcome .
<user1> you can buy the bubble wrap here , but you ' ll have to stand in line over here to post your passage .
<user0> that ' s a really long line . How long do you think it ' ll take to get through all those people ?
<user1> it takes about 3 minutes per person , so it ' ll probably be about an hour ' s wait .
<user0> can I buy stamps here ?
<user1> sure . How many would you like ?
<user0> I need 30 for my Christmas cards .
<user1> are you sending them abroad ?
<user0> twenty of them are going abroad to China and America .
<user1> do you have any going anywhere in the EU ? If you do , those are less expensive .
<user0> no .
<user1> ok , here you go . That will be 18 pounds and seventy two pence .
<user0> and the bubble wrap ?
<user1> that ' s another quid .
<user0> thanks a lot . You ' Ve been very helpful .
<user1> I am cooking now !
<user0> Are you good at cooking ?
<user1> I have studied its skills recently at a training school . I plan to run a restaurant , so I have to practise cooking !
<user0> It is a good idea . What dish are you cooking now ? !
<user1> I am steaming fish in a pressure cooker . Have you ever tried steamed fish ?
<user0> Yes , I have . But the taste of steamed fish at that restaurant is not delicious . The fish is not well-done and too salty .
<user1> That's the case . I think there is not enough time to steam it and soy sauce is too much .
<user0> I have the same idea as yours .
<user1> It's OK . Please have a taste of it .
<user0> Thank you . Oh , it's very delicious .
<user1> Thank you for your praise .
<user0> Besides steamed fish , what else are you good at cooking ?
<user1> I am good at stewing beef with potato , frying chicken , hot and sour soup etc .
<user0> So many dishes . Next Friday week is my birthday . I would like to invite you to cook for my dinner party , OK ?
<user1> Why not ? It is a good opportunity for me to practise cooking .
<user0> Thanks a lot .
<user1> It's my pleasure .
<user1> This is room 2012 . Where is my laundry ? You promised to send to me this morning .
<user0> Well , let me check for you . I am sorry , sir . They mistook your order as a normal one.Actualty it's an express laundry , is that right ?
<user1> Yes , I ordered the express service .
<user0> Sir , we are terribly sorry for that.We will refund the charge and send your laundry to your room 3 hours later . Is that all right ?
<user1> That's fine .
<user1> What is it ?
<user0> Can you mail this at the post office for me ? I have to go to the doctor for an appointment and I don't have enough time to go to the post office .
<user1> Sure . And I'd like you to get some cold medicine for me when you go to the doctor's .
<user1> Would you please fill some gas for me ?
<user0> Sure . Which kind of gas do you want ?
<user1> Unleaded , please .
<user0> OK .
<user1> It can be solved by drawing a draft on us at 90 days sight .
<user0> What about a draft at 120 days sight ?
<user1> All right . But we demand the draft be accepted by a bank acceptable to us .
<user0> A bank's acceptance will add to the costs of our imports . You can rest assured that we will accept the draft and honour it when it comes due .
<user1> Then we will be in a position to arrange for a loan from our bank . You know we exports would like to have our investments returned as early as possible .
<user0> I hope this transaction will pave the way for further business relations between our two countries .
<user1> So do I .
<user1> I haven't seen her yet .
<user0> I think that she is very pretty .
<user1> Tell me how she looks .
<user0> She's kind of short .
<user1> What height is she ?
<user0> She's probably about five feet .
<user1> That's nice , but tell me what she looks like .
<user0> The first thing I noticed was her beautiful brown eyes .
<user1> I think I might've bumped into her before .
<user0> Are you telling me that you've seen her before ?
<user1> I believe so .
<user1> Yes , and I want to buy the insurance too . I think it's necessary .
<user0> You're smart to buy it . At 45 dollars for three days , it is a good deal .
<user1> Can I return the car in San Francisco ?
<user0> San Francisco ? No , sir.We only have this office here . You will have to return it here .
<user1> Really ? I heard in America you can return rental cars in different cities .
<user0> No , sir . That's only with the very big companies . I'm sorry , but this car must be returned to this lot .
<user1> Well , I guess I will have to drive back down then . Hmm . I didn't think of that .
<user0> Do you still want the car , sir ?
<user1> Yes . It will be fun . Driving back down the coast . My girlfriend will like it .
<user0> It's a beautiful drive .
<user1> Where are the keys ?
<user0> Just a moment , sir . We have to finish filling out the forms .
<user1> Sure . Just leave it to me . I'll finish it .
<user1> Speaking of seafood , my mouth is watering . Let's go to the seafood restaurant in our neighborhood .
<user0> Sound great . Let's go !
<user1> Look at the crystal clear fridge . You can see so many kinds of seafood in it . They all look very fresh and delicious .
<user0> True . I would like to have some salmon sashimi and a roast salmon head .
<user1> You sound like a seafood expert . I would like to have some stir-fried squids and steamed shrimps .
<user0> You are not too bad as well . I also want to have a steamed lobster . It is really taste like heaven .
<user1> Let's go into the restaurant and find a table to order some food .
<user0> Wait . Let me tell the lady what we would like to order in front of the seafood fridge first .
<user1> OK . I will wait for you inside the restaurant
<user0> Do you think we should try some deep fried oysters ?
<user1> I'm going to the hospital .
<user0> Get in . I'll take you .
<user1> About how much will it cost ?
<user0> It will cost you $ 10 .
<user1> By the way , what's the time ?
<user0> You can see the time on the meter . I have radio time , you know .
<user1> It's a quarter to 12 . Could you please drive a little faster ?
<user0> Certainly .
<user1> Where was it from ?
<user0> It was made in Jingdezhen .
<user1> Jingdezhen ? Isn't it called ' the capital of porcelain ' ?
<user0> You are right .
<user1> This is the very thing I've been dreaming of .
<user0> It is the best quality porcelain-the famous egg-shell China .
<user1> It must be most precious .
<user0> But it is really worth the price .
<user1> Hello , I am going to the store to buy some fruit .
<user0> Oh , Would you do me a favor ?
<user1> Yes ?
<user0> Please mail this letter for me on your way to the store .
<user1> Sure . Do you want it to be registered ?
<user0> Yes , I think so . There are some pictures in it . It would be a great pity if they were lost .
<user1> Yes , I will be glad to mail your letter .
<user0> Thanks .
<user1> you are welcome .
<user1> Alright .
<user0> It doesn't work . It looks like it's broken . I need to get to a hospital . You should drive me there .
<user1> Oh , yeah ? It's better if we make a police report first . Then you can go to the hospital .
<user0> Damn it ! I'm injured here . We could wait all day for the police .
<user1> Well , you'll just have to wait . I'm not going to move my car until the police arrive . I'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone . Don't worry . You'll get to the hospital in time .
<user0> It really hurts .
<user1> Yes , maybe it does.But if you're going to drive like you did just now , you will have to get used to a little physical pain . You know what I mean ?
<user0> To hell with you . The accident was your fault .
<user1> I'm afraid it wasn't . And when the police get here , you will also see that it wasn't . But enough of this bickering . I'm going to go find a phone.Don ' t move that arm while I'm gone . Alright ?
<user0> To hell with you .
<user1> Hello . I'm thinking about watching a Chinese traditional opera with a foreign girl . What's on this weekend ?
<user0> Well , there will be charity performance on Saturday night . And also , there will be a solo concert by an opera star on Sunday night .
<user1> It's a good thing that I have choices here . Can you tell me about the one on Saturday ?
<user0> Sure . It's to raise money for the homeless .
<user1> What about the performance itself ?
<user0> Oh , it's a reserved opera named The Monkey Creates Havoc in Heaven .
<user1> Wow , a story about the clever Monkey King . It's a classic and children's favorite .
<user0> It surely is . And the cast is really the best .
<user1> Wonderful ! How much is the ticket ?
<user0> The price varies according to the seats . 300 for the front , 200 for the middle , and 50 for the back .
<user1> Well , we could probably get started with a preparatory meeting this afternoon at 2:00 .
<user0> I tell you what , 2:00 is not available for me , but you can get started and I'll come by at around 3:00
<user1> That's fine with me . How much time are we going to have to work on this ?
<user0> Perhaps one year , I'm not sure .
<user1> French dressing , please .
<user0> I beg your pardon ?
<user1> Oh , French dressing .
<user0> Sorry , it's not available now.Anything else ?
<user1> We still prefer French dressing .
<user1> Certainly . And what vegetables would you like ?
<user0> Oh , spinach , I think .
<user1> Fine , And what about something to drink ?
<user0> Just a beer , please .
<user1> Good . Thank you.sir .
<user0> Would you like to have some more beer ?
<user1> No , thanks . I ' Ve had enough . I'll have my bill , please .
<user0> Of course . Please wait a moment . I'll go and get it .
<user1> Thank you .
<user1> Sure . First of all , it ' s very important for you not to be late . Job interviewers usually don ' t think very highly of a candidate who arrives ten minutes after the appointed time , only to explain that he could not find the place or that there was heavy traffic .
<user0> Yeah , that's very important .
<user1> So you ' d better explore the place the day before and at the same time , look around to see what the employees are wearing . So the next day you will arrive early for the appointment .
<user0> I ' ll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer .
<user1> That ' s right . You need to create a good image in a limited time , usually about 30 to 45 minutes .
<user0> It ' s always easier to say something than to do it .
<user1> It ' s not too difficult to make a good impression . For example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . Avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style . This will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications .
<user0> But I love wearing T-shirts and jeans .
<user1> I advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview . Informal clothes as well as torn jeans and dirty shoes convey the impression that you are not serious about the job , or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes .
<user0> It ' s a pity that I cannot afford more expensive clothes .
<user1> You misunderstood me . Clothes which are too colorful or too expensive suggest that you do not understand what behavior is appropriate for the job , or that you are snobbish or frivolous .
<user0> I know what you mean . I ought to wear right clothes at the right time .
<user1> You got it . Only in this way can you gain the respect of the interviewer and his confidence in your judgement .
<user0> It seems that ' clothes make the man ' .
<user1> It may not be true , but the first and lasting impression of you is determined by your clothes and behavior .
<user1> No idea . Your guess is as good as mine .
<user0> It better be more than last year .
<user1> Well , anything is better than nothing . Wait and see .
<user1> What a pity !
<user0> If you don't mind , may we put it off to the next day ?
<user1> That's OK .
<user1> Hello . I need to find out if a Receipt of Proceeds has arrived . I'm from Felix Wasserman Associates .
<user0> Thanks . Have you got the L / C number ?
<user1> It's NX567822100007 .
<user0> Hang on a tick and I'll check for you . I'm sorry ; we have no record of that arriving .
<user1> OK , thanks for checking . Could you give me a ring when it arrives , please ?
<user0> No problem . I'll be in touch as soon as it comes in .
<user1> Yes . I have to stay in your cry for just one day , can you suggest a short tour ?
<user0> Are you interested in the natural landscape or the human landscape ?
<user1> I would prefer the first one .
<user0> Sure . We have a one-day trip along the river . It's quite beautiful .
<user1> I need to find out some more information for L / C . I would like an outline of responsibilities , both ours , yours and the beneficiary , please .
<user0> OK , to start , the conditions are specified by the buyer and may include Insurance Forms , Way Bills , Bills of Lading , Customs forms , various certificates .
<user1> OK , got it . Is there anything else I need to know before we go ahead ?
<user0> Just that in effect , a basic Letter of Credit is a financial contract between the bank , the bank's customer , and the beneficiary , and this contract involves the transfer of goods or services against funds .
<user1> That sounds fine , thanks for that . Let's go ahead !
<user1> I would like to report a break-in .
<user0> When was this break-in ?
<user1> I believe it happened last night .
<user0> Where was the break-in ?
<user1> It happened at my house .
<user0> Was anything stolen ?
<user1> I haven't checked yet .
<user0> Why do you think there was a break-in ?
<user1> My front window was broken .
<user0> We'll send a squad car shortly .
<user1> I'd appreciate that .
<user1> One dollar .
<user0> So , I can have five for five dollars ?
<user1> Actually , you can only have four .
<user0> Oh , yeah . I forgot tax . Give me four then , please .
<user1> Okay . Thanks .
<user1> Come in please .
<user0> Good evening , sir . I come to make the bed . Shall I do it now or later ?
<user1> Well , since you have come , do it now please ?
<user0> That's all . Have a nice stay here .
<user1> Thank you.Please get some soap for us .
<user0> Just a moment . I will do it right now .
<user1> Oh ? What ' s wrong ?
<user0> My daughter ' s just banged up her knee pretty badly and I ' m going to have to take her to the hospital . I ' ll be about two hours late .
<user1> Yes , come in please . I am Mr . Li . You must be My Liu , right ?
<user0> Yes , I am My Liu . Thanks .
<user1> I'd like to start this interview with some questions . Why do you think you are qualified for this position ?
<user0> According to your advertisement , you want an experienced software engineer . I think my background meets the requirement of this position .
<user1> Then tell me something about your background .
<user0> My major was computer science when I was at college , and I am quite familiar with Visual C + + and Java language .
<user1> Well , what do you think about the development in computers ?
<user0> The developments in software are going ahead very quickly and more and more problems are resolved by software . In some regions , the hardware is completely replaced by software . So I think the software industry has a great future .
<user1> Have you ever designed any programs concerning network ?
<user0> Yes , I have designed some programs for the network with Visual C + + and I have passed the test for programmers - MUSE .
<user1> Have you got anything to ask me ?
<user0> Yes , can you tell me what's my responsibility in this position ?
<user1> Yes , of course . You would be responsible for the development of software products .
<user0> I see . This is my advantage .
<user1> Good . Have you got any other questions ?
<user0> No .
<user1> Ok , I will contact you in a week . See you .
<user0> Thank you , bye-bye .
<user1> Can you take he away from me ?
<user0> I ' m just coming for that .
<user1> She kept bothering me .
<user0> She ' s your sister . What she asked was only duck soup for you . Why can ' t you be good to her ?
<user1> But I am her brother , not her servant .
<user1> Maybe you should look around for an outlet .
<user0> That is a wonderful idea .
<user1> Outlets have more reasonable prices .
<user0> Thank you for your help .
<user1> No problem . Good luck
<user1> The apples are 30NT each . How many would you like ?
<user0> Let's see , 30NT is about ... almost a dollar US . What ? ! How about these pineapples ?
<user1> They're 250NT each , but they're not edible . They're only used for worship .
<user0> Hmm , 250NT is ... 8 dollars ? ! ! And you can't even eat them ? You're crazy !
<user1> Wait ! Don't go just yet . These bananas are pretty cheap--only 35NT for this bunch .
<user0> Now that's more like it ! Bananas have lots of potassium , too !
<user1> They're also good for your digestion ! Would you like some kiwis , too ?
<user0> Are they from Taiwan ?
<user1> They're imported from New Zealand . Four for 50NT . Nine for a hundred .
<user0> OK . I'll take four kiwis .
<user1> sure . What do you need ?
<user0> well , I wanted to let you know that I've put in my notice .
<user1> really ? Why ?
<user0> it's complicated . But basically it boils down to one thing . This company is downsizing and I can't continue working for a company that may let me go .
<user1> but surely they won't fire you ! You're one of the most experienced managers here !
<user0> well , to be honest , there's another reason . I've got a better offer .
<user1> well that's great news ! Congratulations ! Where will you be located ?
<user0> the head office is in New York , but I'll be dealing with overseas companies and flying to this side of the world from time to time .
<user1> it'll be sad to see you go , but it sounds like you're found yourself a great opportunity .
<user0> I have . I feel lucky . I look forward to dealing with overseas companies and at the same time having a chance to use English more .
<user1> I'm sorry to bring this up , but would it be possible for you to write me a letter of recommendation before you go ?
<user0> of course I can . In fact , if there are other job opportunities at this new company , I'll recommend you personally .
<user1> thanks . I appreciate that .
<user1> Do you have this shirt in a small ?
<user0> Let me check . Yes , we have .
<user1> May I try it on ?
<user0> Sure . Let me help you .
<user1> I had it right here a minute ago , Mr . Emory . Umm . Just a minute ...
<user0> Christine , I know you ' re new here and there ' s a lot to learn , but you are going to have to learn to keep your work in better order . We can ' t afford to lose an important document .
<user1> Yes , sir . I apologize for that . Here ' s the file you were looking for , Mr . Emory .
<user1> Sorry , I'm using it myself.But you can use it this afternoon .
<user0> Thank you very much .
<user1> Don't mention it , let's go in .
<user0> Yeah , this place looks great . Wow , look at her , she can certainly get down , can't she ?
<user1> She sure can . Are you jealous , Leslie ?
<user0> A little , I wish I could do that .
<user1> You can ! With a little practice .
<user0> Look at him , he's buff .
<user1> I think he's hot too .
<user0> How do they all get in such tiptop shape ?
<user1> Exercised over and over . Exercise is a key .
<user0> That's it . I decided to turn over a new leaf . I'm going to exercise every single day .
<user1> Good for you , Leslie !
<user1> OK , how was everything ?
<user0> Very nice . Thank you .
<user1> Would you like this to-go ?
<user0> Yes , can you put it in a plastic bag ?
<user1> Sure , no problem . Here you are . That'll be 25 dollars .
<user0> Do you take credit cards ?
<user1> Yes , we accept Visa and MasterCard .
<user0> OK , here you are .
<user1> Thanks . I'll be right back .
<user0> OK .
<user1> Here's your receipt .
<user0> Thank you .
<user1> You're welcome . Please come again .
<user1> I'm going to quit the job .
<user0> Why ?
<user1> The task is tough .
<user0> You'd look before you leap .
<user1> Thanks for your concern .
<user1> Just tor three days . I won't need these luggages.CouId I put them here ?
<user0> I am sorry . If you have here more than 24 hours between connecting flights , we can't check your luggage through London .
<user1> Well , maybe I can put them in the airport storage there .
<user0> That's right . It's over there .
<user1> No , thanks . I'm on a diet .
<user1> That's over on Callaway Street , isn't it ?
<user0> Yes , but I can't find Callaway Street .
<user1> Walk that way for about four blocks . The hotel's about two blocks north of there .
<user0> Thanks a lot .
<user1> Not at all .
<user1> Better late than never .
<user1> For what ? Are you taking up painting ?
<user0> No . I can't paint . I'm asking for my niece . She is really into it .
<user1> Oh , good . How old is your niece ?
<user0> She is eight . Actually , I'm buying a good set of art supplies for her as a birthday gift .
<user1> It's a wise thing to do . Art will do a child a world of good .
<user1> Hi , Mr . Smith . This is Mary . Is Jenny there ?
<user0> No , I ' m afraid not , Mary . May I take a message for her ?
<user1> Yes , please tell her that band practice has been moved to Tuesday night at eight thirty .
<user0> O . K . No problem . Anything else ?
<user1> No , but if she has any questions , she can call me at 555-2345 .
<user0> All right , I ' ll leave her the message , Mary . Thanks for calling .
<user1> Thank you . Bye .
<user0> Goodbye .
<user1> Yes , a little .
<user0> Can you tell me how to get to the Jade Buddha Temple ?
<user1> I'm sorry . I can't quite follow you . Would you mind speaking slowly ?
<user1> I've a driver mate in my car !
<user0> So you have all the news on broadcast ?
<user1> Yes , it's so helpful .
<user1> Yes , I'm in a bit of a rush . Could I have a piece of apple pie please ?
<user0> Certainly . Would you like it with ice cream ?
<user1> No , thanks .
<user1> Yes.Would tomorrow morning be all right with you ?
<user0> Sorry , I've got a meeting from nine to ten.What about Monday afternoon ?
<user1> I'm afraid he's fully engaged.Could you make it another time ?
<user1> I'm just shopping .
<user0> What are you shopping for ?
<user1> Some new clothes . How about you ?
<user0> Same here .
<user1> Have you found anything nice yet ?
<user0> I found a few pairs of pants .
<user1> Where'd you get those ?
<user0> I found them at JC Pennies .
<user1> Those are really cute .
<user0> Do you want me to show you where I found them ?
<user1> I would like that . Thank you .
<user1> Yes , speaking .
<user0> I want to know whether you will come to the interview . So have you accepted offers from other companies ?
<user1> No , I haven't got one by now . I will go to the interview of yours .
<user1> Yes , of course . We could split it . What part would you like to do , the food or the entertainment ?
<user0> I have no idea what the entertainment should be .
<user1> Let's make sure we are on the same page . Do we want a formal or informal gathering ?
<user0> Let's make it a formal affair .
<user1> Yes , that would be best . Now , for food should we have Chinese or American food ?
<user0> American food would be the best choice .
<user1> That would be great . What kind of music would you like , a band or recorded music ?
<user0> We should bring in a really good DJ .
<user1> That works for me . Let's see what we can each do about planning our part and meet again on Friday .
<user1> What's the matter ?
<user1> Scrambled egg , bacon , three pieces of bread and a cup of tea .
<user0> Would you care for some lemon for your tea ?
<user1> No , thank you .
<user1> Over there .
<user1> Yeah , I really wanted that Chanel bag , too . But just in case you should bid low .
<user0> But there are only two more days until the bidding closes !
<user1> I bid on a Chanel watch at the last minute , and got it sixty percent off !
<user0> Oh ... I'm such a newbie . But at least I'm sure I'll get that tennis racket .
<user1> Don't count on it , Babe . eBay is always full of surprises .
<user0> Well ... guess how low the bidding starts on the tennis racket ?
<user1> Pots and pans are right over there .
<user0> Oh , thank you .
<user1> Could I interest you in our store credit card ?
<user0> No , thanks . I already have credit cards .
<user1> But our credit card saves you 10 percent .
<user0> That's a nice discount .
<user1> Here . Let me give you an application form .
<user0> Thank you , but I'm just browsing today .
<user1> Okay . Enjoy your browsing .
<user1> I'm allergic to these things , you know .
<user0> Sorry , I forgot . I don ' t like seafood , neither .
<user1> Let ' s go over there and get some milk , a couple dozen eggs and some orange juice .
<user0> Let's get frozen juice . It is really good . We ' Ve got enough food . Let ' s go over to the check-out stand .
<user1> OK . But just let me pick up a bottle of cooking wine and oil as we go by .
<user1> You are speaking with Professor Clark .
<user0> Professor , I am Kalina from your morning literature class .
<user1> Yes , how can I help you ?
<user0> I ran my car into a tree yesterday and need to miss a few days of school .
<user1> Oh , my God ! I hope you are all right .
<user0> I have a concussion , but I will be OK .
<user1> How much school will you miss ?
<user0> I only need to take this week off .
<user1> I appreciate you calling and telling me that you won ' t be in class . See you next week !
<user1> Can ' t complain . And you ?
<user0> Business is booming . I understand you want to meet up with me next week . How ' s your schedule looking ?
<user1> Let me see . I can come out and see you first thing Wednesday .
<user0> Great .
<user1> You mean the network connection ?
<user0> Yes , I wanted to look for some information on the company page just now . It took me almost one minute to open it . Then there is no response to any click .
<user1> I have the same question . I can ' t send out mails . We ' d better call the IT department and ask them to check it immediately .
<user0> Ok .
<user1> Dad , I have to do my homework .
<user0> No , honey , why didn't you go to cram school last night ?
<user1> Dad , I don't want to talk about it now .
<user0> Honey , if you don't want to go to cram school , you should tell me the reason why .
<user1> I'm sorry , dad . But I would rather stay at school than go to cram school .
<user1> Doctor , I have a bad cough and a headache .
<user0> Do you have a fever ?
<user1> I don't know , but I feel terrible .
<user0> Let me examine you . Don't worry . It's nothing serious .
<user1> Do you think I should lie in bed ?
<user0> Yes , stay in bed and drink a lot of water . Your fever will be gone in a day or two .
<user1> OK . Do you think I can play football tomorrow ?
<user0> Of course not . You need a good rest .
<user1> OK , I'll listen to you .
<user1> What do you have in mind ?
<user0> A dessert sounds nice .
<user1> What kind are you thinking of getting ?
<user0> I want to get some pie .
<user1> What kind of pie do you want ?
<user0> I have no idea .
<user1> Do you want to know what kind of pie I like ?
<user0> Sure , what kind do you like ?
<user1> I love apple pie .
<user0> Oh , I love apple pie too .
<user1> There you go . Problem solved .
<user1> I'll be with you in a minute .
<user1> Yes . Do you exchange foreign money here ?
<user0> Yes . Our bank is authorized to deal with foreign exchange .
<user1> What kinds of currency do you change ?
<user0> We can change only three kinds of currency , USD , Japanese Yen and HK Dollar in our savings office .
<user1> Could you tell me what the exchange rate for USD is today ?
<user0> The buying rate is 826 . 44 yuan for 100 dollars .
<user1> I want to change some Us dollars to cover my expense here .
<user0> Please go to Counter No . 2 , the foreign exchange counter . It's over there .
<user1> Thank you .
<user1> My name is Steven . I'm the Sales Manager of this company .
<user0> Well , look here . Ten new typewriters were delivered to my company yesterday afternoon and only five of them work properly .
<user1> Oh , I'm sorry about that .
<user0> Never mind being sorry , what are you going to do about it ?
<user1> Don't worry , we'll soon fix them .
<user0> Good , I hope you'll make sure that it won't happen again .
<user1> I'll certainly look into that .
<user0> Thank you . Goodbye .
<user1> Yes , sir . What price range do you have in mind ?
<user0> I'm not sure . I don't know very much about the price of pearls .
<user1> I see . Let me show you some samples of various qualities . This one is very nice . It's three hundred and fifty dollars .
<user0> Is there a price reduction ?
<user1> We are having a sale now . The price has already gone down .
<user0> How much is that one ?
<user1> It's two hundred and eighty dollars .
<user0> OK . I'll take it . Thank you .
<user1> Yes , I would like to buy a Walkman . Can you tell me about the models you have ?
<user0> Well , we have a lot of models here.Did you want to listen to CD's or cassettes or the radio ?
<user1> Mostly cassette tapes .
<user0> Alright . There are several models you may want to look at.This Kreng portable cassette player is very good .
<user1> Kreng ? I've never heard of that company .
<user0> It's a German company.This unit has auto-reverse , recording capability , and an AM / FM radio band.It also has a built-in microphone .
<user1> I suppose I don't want that one then . I don't like auto-reverse . It breaks too easily .
<user0> Really ? Have you had an auto-reverse break before ?
<user1> Yes , twice now . I think it's too high-tech , and so it's the first part that breaks .
<user0> Hmm . You know , the problem might be dust . Did you clean the unit often ?
<user1> Well . No , I didn't clean it.But still , I only had the last one two months , and it broke . I don't trust auto-reverse .
<user0> Alright . Well . We have many units without auto-reverse.Here is a good unit . Very reliable.It has an AM / FM band , built-in microphone , recording capability , and no auto-reverse .
<user1> How much is it ?
<user0> This one sells for $ 39.99 .
<user1> Can I test it out ?
<user0> Of course .
<user1> It sounds great . I'll take it .
<user0> Fine . I think you'll be happy with it . It's a very good unit . Very reliable . I'll go get you a new one in a box . I will be back in just a moment .
<user1> Thanks .
<user1> I was born and raised in Beijing . I attended Peking University and received my bachelor's degree in Economics . I have worked for 2 years as a financial consultant in Beijing for China Pacific Insurance Co . Ltd .
<user0> What type of position are you looking for ?
<user1> I'm looking for a position in which I can utilize my experience .
<user0> Are you interested in a full-time or part-time position ?
<user1> I am more interested in a full-time position . However , I would also consider a part-time position .
<user0> Can you tell me about your responsibilities at your last job ?
<user1> I advised customers on financial matters . After I consulted the customer , I completed a customer inquiry form and catalogued the information in our database . I then collaborated with colleagues to prepare the best possible package for the client . The clients were then presented with a summarized report on their financial activities that I formulated on a quarterly basis .
<user0> What is your greatest strength ?
<user1> I am an excellent communicator . People trust me and come to me for advice . One afternoon , my colleague was involved with a troublesome customer who felt he was not being served well . I made the customer a cup of coffee and invited both my colleague and the client to my desk where we solved the problem together .
<user0> What is your greatest weakness ?
<user1> I tend to spend too much time making sure the customer is satisfied . However , I began setting time-limits for myself .
<user0> Why do you want to work for our company ?
<user1> After following your firm's progress for the last 3 years , I am convinced that your company is becoming one of the market leaders and I would like to be a part of that team .
<user0> When can you begin ?
<user1> Immediately .
<user1> Well , all right . There are four points you should keep in mind when you file documents , information and other things .
<user0> What are they ?
<user1> They are keep the documents in chronological order , remove all the chips and pins , punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder .
<user0> And what is the most important point ?
<user1> You should always remember that one customer one file is the rule .
<user1> Yes , they were . But it has already past . The traffic from the airport to downtown has been relieved after the completion of Yan'an Aerial Road .
<user0> We've never expected that Shanghai is such a big metropolis , same as New York city . David , would it be a good idea to rent a car here ? I've got an international driver's license with a pretty good record in the States .
<user1> That's wonderful . OK . I'll remember that . But I have to warn you that you must drive very carefully in the downtown area , for there're no separate lanes for motor vehicles and bicycles in some places , and still quite a few people don't take road regulations seriously .
<user1> You can ' t really tell everything about a house from the outside . Let ' s go inside .
<user0> I don ' t think that it is looking any better inside here .
<user1> I think that fresh paint and cleaning would help it look a little better .
<user0> It is just too dark in here with so few windows .
<user1> I hear that the kitchen is quite large . Let ' s go check it out .
<user0> The kitchen may be large , but it doesn ' t have any storage space .
<user1> The master suite is supposed to be quite elegant . Maybe it will be a little better .
<user0> How many dogs live in this house ?
<user1> I think that we have seen all that we need to see here . Let ' s go look at another house .
<user1> Have you decided what wine you would like ?
<user0> I have no idea . Maybe you can give me some advice .
<user1> I recommend you the white wine . It will wake up your appetite .
<user0> That's great , bring me a bottle of that please .
<user1> Wait a minute ! Just hold your horses ! What's your hurry , anyway ?
<user0> Well , I've got to stop and get gas in the car , first .
<user1> That won't take long .
<user0> Well , it won't if there no line at the pump .
<user1> Well , I'm not quite ready .
<user0> I'll give you five more minutes , then I'm going on without you !
<user1> You wouldn't do a thing like that !
<user0> Oh , yes , I would !
<user1> Engaged ? She ' s married .
<user0> Johnny , I wish you ' d stop reaching for things . Haven ' t you a tongue ?
<user1> Yes , Mother , but my arm is longer .
<user1> Not a problem . What time shall we call you ?
<user0> I always hit the snooze button , so give me two calls , one at 7 and another at 7 fifteen .
<user1> It'll be our pleasure . We'll call you at 7 and then at 7 fifteen .
<user0> Oops , cancel that . Change the second call to 7 thirty will you , please ?
<user1> No sooner said than done . Can I help you with anything else ?
<user0> No , that's about it for now . Thanks .
<user1> Okay , sir . Have a pleasant evening .
<user1> Yes , I have , Mr . Thomas . We'll pack them two dozen to one carton , and the gross weight is around 25 kilos a carton .
<user1> Take it easy.you ' Ve made enough preparations .
<user0> I'm in such a need of the job that I can't afford any mistakes .
<user1> I'm sure you'll pass it .
<user1> Let me see . Laptop , flash disk , a ballpoint pen , a pencil , a notebook , a pair of glasses , cell phone , charger , moisture lotion , ... Oh , that is too much . You are not going to a business trip .
<user0> I guess I need all of them .
<user1> Actually , the company will provide you with all of these supplies . So , you can leave this very thick notebook at home .
<user0> I know . But it is my lucky charm . I carry it all the time .
<user1> Suit yourself . Don ' t forget to set the alarm clock .
<user1> Yes . I want to go to Beijing Hotel .
<user0> I'm sorry . You are going in the wrong direction .
<user1> Oh no ! What shall I do ?
<user0> Don't worry . You can get off at the next stop and go across the street through the overpass . The bus stop is right there .
<user1> Thank you very much .
<user0> My pleasure .
<user1> Hum ... Why not go shopping the day after tomorrow ? Tomorrow is Saturday . I hate all the hustle and bustle of Saturday shopping .
<user0> But Sunday is the same with Saturday . If you don ' t mind , that's OK .
<user1> Hum.Maybe it will be better . The most important thing is that I can have a day to relax after a week's work .
<user0> I see . We will go the day after tomorrow .
<user1> By the way , what kind of stores do we need to go ?
<user0> I want to buy some clothes in clothing store . When we are going back , go to the butcher's shop and buy some chicken .
<user1> Let ' s also go to the jewelry store to buy a crystal necklace . I want to buy one for you as your birthday present .
<user0> Thank you , darling .
<user1> How tall is this building ?
<user0> It stands 320m ( 1050ft ) high and held the record as the world's tallest structure until 1930 .
<user1> I have heard its name is connected with someone , is that right ?
<user0> Yes , the towel was named after its designer Gustave Eiffel .
<user1> I ' m calling to cancel my reservation for Trans Pacific Flight 8 on July 19 from Taipei to Minneapolis . Could you please make it for the same flight on August 2 instead of July 19 ?
<user0> What ' s your name , please ?
<user1> My name is Judy Wang .
<user0> How do you spell your name , please ?
<user1> My first name is J-U-D-Y , and my last name is W-A-N-G .
<user0> Please note that this ticket has a penalty of $ 75 for any change or cancellation .
<user1> It ' s OK . Where should I pay for the penalty ?
<user0> At the airport . OK , Miss . Wang , your Flight 8 on July 19 from Taipei to Minneapolis is canceled . Your new reservation is Trans Pacific Flight 8 from Taipei to Minneapolis at 9 thirty a . m . on August 2 .
<user1> That ' s 1POJ7403 .
<user0> That ' s correct .
<user1> Thank you !
<user0> Is there anything else I can do for you ?
<user1> No , thanks . I ' m all set . Good-bye .
<user1> Yeah . This is supply . What can I do for you ?
<user0> This is Rachel in Human Resources . I need two boxes of company letterhead , one box of ball-point pens , and a box of envelopes .
<user1> All right . No problem . What ' s your extension ?
<user1> Yes , certainly . How can I recognize him ?
<user0> He is short , well-built , and he ' s got light blond hair .
<user1> Is there anything else ?
<user0> He has a mustache , if I remember correctly , and a light complexion .
<user1> How old is he ?
<user0> He is in his late thirties .
<user1> Well . I shouldn ' t have any trouble recognizing him . What time does his flight arrive ?
<user0> At 2 thirty .
<user1> Could I get a hamburger , please ?
<user0> Would you like cheese on that ?
<user1> No , thank you .
<user0> Would you like a drink ?
<user1> Let me have a soda .
<user0> What kind of soda would you like ?
<user1> May I have a Sprite , please ?
<user0> Sure , no problem .
<user1> I would also like a bag of chips .
<user0> Will that be all ?
<user1> That's everything .
<user1> I majored in international banking at college so I took many insurance courses . And I worked at an insurance company for my graduation field work .
<user0> Why do you want to be an insurance agent ?
<user1> I care about people and I know the importance of insurance .
<user0> Do you have any work experience in promotion ?
<user1> Yes , I do . I have worked as a salesman for P & G Company Ltd .
<user0> Do people respond well to you ?
<user1> Yes , I'm good with people .
<user1> This is the place I was telling you about .
<user0> Would you like to sit near the window ?
<user1> Good .
<user0> Let's have a look at the menu . Oh , there isn't a menu . Do you think you could ask the people at the next table if we could look at their menu ?
<user1> Yes , of course . Excuse me . Could you possibly let us see your menu ? Oh . They haven't got one either .
<user1> I ' m thinking about it . How much is it ?
<user0> ¥ 350 .
<user1> Oh , dear . It ' s too expensive . Can you give me a better price ?
<user0> Your discount is already included . Normally we charge ¥ 400 , but now we can give you a special price . This is our sale period .
<user1> It ' s still too much . Can ' t you make it any cheaper than that ?
<user0> Sorry , but this is the best price . You can ' t get it any cheaper than here .
<user1> I see . Can I pay by traveler ' s checks ?
<user0> I'm afraid you can ' t . You ' re welcome to pay in cash .
<user1> Sure . What do you need ?
<user0> I'm having some trouble . How do you use this printer ?
<user1> Well , first you have to turn this switch on .
<user0> Silly me .
<user1> Now press this button .
<user0> Oh , and it's out of paper . Do you have any more ?
<user1> Just a second . I'll go get some .
<user1> Tell me what the problem is .
<user0> I can't figure out how to turn them on .
<user1> Do you have some quarters ?
<user0> I didn't know I needed change .
<user1> The washer costs 50 cents and the dryer costs a dollar .
<user0> Where do I put the change ?
<user1> The quarters go into the slot . You have to push the slot in , and the machine will turn on .
<user0> Is that everything that I have to do ?
<user1> That's all there is .
<user0> I appreciate you helping me with this .
<user1> If you need anything else , just let me know .
<user1> Yes , do I have to work a whole year before I can take a vacation ?
<user0> Yes , after you ' Ve been here a year , you qualify for a three-day vacation
<user1> Only three days ?
<user0> That's the company policy .
<user1> What happens if I use up my sick days before the end of the year ? If I ' m sick an extra day or two , will my pay be deducted ?
<user0> Yes . That's the company policy .
<user1> It was the same as the last place I worked at . I was hoping you ' d be different .
<user1> Yeah . I am too .
<user0> Where did you want to go for lunch ?
<user1> I was thinking we should just go to the cafeteria .
<user0> I don't think I ever got food from the cafeteria .
<user1> I actually like the food there .
<user0> Does the cafeteria sell a lot of different food ?
<user1> They have anything you want .
<user0> I was thinking about getting some Chinese food .
<user1> I bought some chow mein at the cafeteria . It tasted great .
<user0> We can eat at the cafeteria .
<user1> I think you'll really like the food there .
<user1> That's OK .
<user0> The contract is to be written in Chinese and English . Both languages are equally effective .
<user1> Fine . If you'll excuse me , I'd like to go it over first . ( After about 15 minutes ) Hmm , you've done a pretty good job . It's well prepared .
<user0> Thank you .
<user1> Well , I suggest that we discuss only the clauses and points where we have different opinions just to save time .
<user0> That's a good idea .
<user1> First , let's read Clause Two about packing . It's our usual practice to ship our products in containers . That'll save time and money , but your contract stipulates the use of wooden cases . So , we'd like to have the words containers are allowed in the contract .
<user0> Agreed .
<user1> For shipment , you know we are producing a complete set of equipment for you and it won't all be finished at one time . So would you allow us to make partial shipments .
<user0> I understand your position .
<user1> Certainty.Do you want double breasted suit or single breasted suit ?
<user0> I prefer single breasted suit .
<user1> What about this one ? It's a very nice 3 - piece suit .
<user0> That looks great . Do you have ties here ?
<user1> How do you do , Jack . Nice to meet you .
<user0> Well , I think you ' Ve reconsidered our proposal , Diane .
<user1> Yes , you are right . After all , the quality of your air conditioners is good . The only problem is price .
<user0> I should not be surprised , many customers have the same opinion . Do you have any suggestion in mind ? Our salesman told your secretary that the price could be negotiable .
<user1> That's why I came to your office today . We think for your model WE - 506 $ 590 would be reasonable , because air conditioners of the same kind sold by other companies are usually about 579-649 .
<user0> That's true . But if you understand that quality is the most important aspect of a product , you'll agree that 679 is not high , especially when we allow you a 10 % discount .
<user1> I see your point . That's to say s 611 each set . Still it's much higher than the market price . Could you see your way to reduce the price , Jack ?
<user0> Well , considering the quantity of your order we could further reduce the price to 600 . That's the best we can do . What do you think of that ?
<user1> All right . We accept it . So $ 600 for each set .
<user0> Very well . Thank you .
<user1> I'm not sure.You look familiar .
<user0> You're Mr.Stevenson , right ?
<user1> Yes.And you're Mr.Jones , I remember .
<user1> Yes , I have an overall understanding .
<user0> When we have the final results , we will call you .
<user1> Then when will I get a reply at the latest ?
<user0> If you pass the interview , the personnel department will inform you within two weeks .
<user1> But if I don't pass , will you call me ?
<user0> I'm sorry we won't . You can wait for two weeks . If you don't get a telephone call , it means that you weren't successful .
<user1> Then do I have the chance to get this job ?
<user0> I'm sorry but I can't make the final decision myself , and I have to discuss it with other interviewers .
<user1> I know . No matter what the result will be , I have learned a lot from our conversation .
<user0> Your mentality is very good and that's great .
<user1> Thanks for giving me the opportunity of this interview .
<user0> My pleasure .
<user1> Well , you'd better lie down now . You need a good rest .
<user0> All right . I'll do that .
<user1> I'm quite active and energetic . I approach things enthusiastically and I don't like to leave things half-done .
<user0> Do you think you are introverted or extroverted ?
<user1> I'm quite outgoing i think . I enjoy mixing and doing things with others .
<user0> What do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ?
<user1> I maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . A person can't live all by himself I think . A friend in need is a friend in deed.The more really close friends I have , the better .
<user0> What kind of people do you like to work with ?
<user1> People who are honest , dedicated to their work and having integrity .
<user1> Hello , everybody . I am Monica and this is my first day at work . I am working in the finance department . I am very happy to meet everyone and I am looking forward to working well with all of you . I am very happy to be one of the team and I will do my best to get into the working situation as soon as possible . By the way , call me Monica . Everybody calls me so .
<user1> Yes . I was president of the Student Council of our university .
<user0> Did you get any honors or awards at your university ?
<user1> Yes . I was elected Excellent Party Member for four academic years .
<user0> Were you involved in any club activities at your university ?
<user1> Yes . I was a member of the Student Poetry Society . I like writing poems in my spare time .
<user0> What extracurricular activities did you usually take part in at your college ?
<user1> I sometimes played table tennis and sometimes played basketball .
<user1> What's the criteria for staff to attend ? Are we only including our management team in this affair ? Or will we be extending invitations to lower level employees to attend ?
<user0> Lower level employees need not attend . The purpose of this retreat is for training , especially for our management team . We want to develop a well-oiled machine on our executive level . In order to get everyone to jell together , we've got to include some fun . That's the reason for the retreat .
<user1> Why ?
<user0> Because it doesn't require a lot of energy and thus easy to keep up .
<user1> But I see people sweat a lot doing Yoga too .
<user0> I don't know . I just need to try it once . I'm in urgent need of some exercise to lose some weight .
<user1> You should try swimming then . It helps you to keep fit .
<user1> I think my English is fairly good . As you can see from my CV , I graduated from university with a B . A . degree in English . I studied the English language and English literature systematically .
<user0> How are your typing and shorthand skills ?
<user1> I can type 80 words a minute , basically no mistake , and can take dictation in English at 120 words per minute .
<user1> Yes . When can I get them back ?
<user0> Well , if they are collected right now , you can get them back tonight .
<user1> That's fine . By the way , please have that suit dry cleaned .
<user0> OK . Please fill in the form first .
<user1> Is your blood pressure , I'm afraid . It's far too high .
<user0> And what's the cause of that ?
<user1> Overwork-amongst other things . You can't work 24 hours a day . You ' Ve got to slow down .
<user0> But I can't just slow down .
<user1> You've got to , I'm afraid . And look at this . You weigh 200 stones . That's too much for a man of your size .
<user0> You mean I've got to lose weight ?
<user1> Yes . You've got to cut down on bread and potatoes and take more exercise .
<user1> Exercise . The morning hours are the most precious period within a single day . We should not pass them up easily . Seize the time and do something useful .
<user0> So , you choose to spend it on bodybuilding . Where do you exercise ?
<user1> Usually , I run to the Black Bamboo Park as a warm-up . Admission is free . Then I start my activities .
<user0> Do you do the same exercises every day ?
<user1> No , I've deliberately kept a balance between various exercises ; parallel bars , push-ups , sit-ups , bunny-hops , five-kilometer run , and so on . I alternate them over the weekdays . Sometimes , when I find myself in a bad state , I will simply idle about in the park .
<user0> Why don't you just stay in bed when you are feeling unfit for exercising ?
<user1> It's not easy to keep a good habit , you know . I fear that if I fail to get up early one day , I may find it still more difficult to rise early the next . Besides , a mere walk in the early morning is much fun , too . Here and there in the park , you meet whole gangs of senior citizens who might be singing operas or old songs , playing er'hu , chess , or just chatting and gossiping . It's interesting to join them .
<user0> Oh , yes . Singing is also a good way of keeping fit , at least mentally .
<user1> I think Pond's is the best .
<user0> And they're very dear , too .
<user1> They're on special offer today .
<user0> Oh , that's ideal .
<user1> First , you should have enough sleep to get over the jet lag before the departure . Most people will suffer from jet lag for a few days after a long flight .
<user0> I will go to bed early tonight .
<user1> Do you have an airsickness ?
<user0> I don't know . But I have a carsickness .
<user1> You'd better bring some medicine for airsickness .
<user0> Thank you .
<user1> Can you do that in the mornings , or would the afternoons be best ?
<user0> Either way is good for me .
<user1> There are a number of open houses this weekend in your area . Would that okay with you ?
<user0> I can take a little time off of work , or I can go on a weekend , also .
<user1> We could meet at the real estate office , or I could pick you up at your home .
<user0> I am leaving from work , so maybe I could just meet you at the first house that we will look at .
<user1> I can think of five houses that we should look at . It will take most of the day .
<user0> I would like to see as many as possible .
<user1> When I have confirmed the times with the owners , I will e-mail you our plans for the day .
<user1> Yes , here is the table , which plans do you like best ?
<user0> The seven-days trip shall be fine . How much is this tour ?
<user1> $ 300 .
<user0> We will take the trip . Could you give us a pamphlet ?
<user1> Here you are .
<user1> What do you mean ?
<user0> Now , I am responsible for training new staff , but you keep overriding my authority by trying to pose your methods . I know you are a hotshot college graduate with something to prove . But I don ' t like your way .
<user1> Enough is enough . I know .
<user1> I'm sorry , Mrs . Lin . We don't allow smoking in the office .
<user1> I want to American breakfast with fried eggs sunny side up .
<user0> What kind of juice do you prefer , sir ?
<user1> Breakfast juice and please make my coffee very strong .
<user0> Yes , sir . American breakfast with fried eggs sunny side up . Breakfast juice and black coffee . And my correct , sir ?
<user1> Yes , that ' s right .
<user0> Is there anything else , sir ?
<user1> No , that ' s all .
<user0> Good morning , sir . I ' Ve got breakfast your ordered .
<user1> Just put it on the table please .
<user0> Do you need anything else , sir ?
<user1> No , thanks . Oh , yes , could I have some juice for the mini bar ?
<user0> What kind of juice do you like sir ?
<user1> Tomato or orange juice , please .
<user0> Yes , sir . I ' ll get them for you right away . Would you please sign this bill first ? Thank you , sir .
<user1> Yeah , we probably should.How much is normal ?
<user0> How about 10 percent ? That's about 6 dollars .
<user1> That sounds about right .
<user1> It will leave at 3:00 p . m .
<user0> When does it arrive ?
<user1> It should be due in at 7:30 a . m.tomorrow .
<user0> How much is the ticket ?
<user1> It's 86 coach and 175 berths
<user0> One berth , please .
<user1> Where to , sir ?
<user0> Beijing Library .
<user1> Hop in , please .
<user0> Is it a long ride to Beijing Library ?
<user1> It will take about thirty minutes because it is the rush hour .
<user0> Thirty minutes , that will be all right . There are still fifty minutes to go before the library is open . Look , what are they doing on the square ?
<user1> It is an exhibition of Chinese jades . It is held each year . A nice collection jades of are on display and sold .
<user0> Sounds great ! Can you stop somewhere here for a minute ? I will get some souvenirs for my friends .
<user1> No problem .
<user1> Three bags and a suitcase . This is my luggage to check .
<user0> Do you have any carry-on luggage ?
<user1> No .
<user0> Put your luggage on the scale , please . Oh , your luggage is overweight .
<user1> How much is the excess baggage part charge ?
<user0> Twenty-two dollars
<user1> Here you are .
<user0> This is your voucher , and you can get your luggage back on this . Have a good trip !
<user1> Thank you !
<user1> Do you have any seats for September 16th ?
<user0> Let's see ... I'm afraid the 16th is fully booked . But I have seats for the 17th .
<user1> The 17th will be fine .
<user0> And what date will you be returning ?
<user1> Hmm , I guess on the 28th .
<user0> Okay , you're booked on American Airlines flight 710 , departing JFK at 6
<user1> Sounds good . Thanks a lot .
<user1> Do you have any special brand in your mind ?
<user0> No , I never wear suit in my everyday life . I just want one to take part in my sister ' s wedding ceremony .
<user1> I see . Have a look at this one . It ' s very cheap because it ' s not very durable .
<user0> but it looks good . Let me try it on .
<user1> Ok , the mirror is over there .
<user1> I am looking for a pair of shoes .
<user0> Do you like high heels or flat shoes ?
<user1> High hells , please . I want to wear them in formal situations .
<user1> Sure , what ' s up ?
<user0> Some of us are going to start a soccer team . Would you like to join us ?
<user1> I don ' t know anything about it . Soccer isn ' t as popular in my country as it is here .
<user0> That ' s all right . We ' ll teach you .
<user1> Is it anything like American football ?
<user0> Not very much . It ' s something like hockey , except that you use a big ball and no stick .
<user1> I ' ll come down and watch you play some day , and see what it ' s like .
<user0> Good idea . I think you ' ll like it if you give it a chance .
<user1> Yes , G stands for General Audiences , PG means Parental Guidance suggested , R is restricted to audiences under 18 and X means explicit content .
<user0> Does anyone pay any attention to those ratings anymore ?
<user1> Remember when we were kids ? Theaters wouldn't let kids in to PG moves without a parent .
<user0> I remember that I never saw an X moves even displayed .
<user1> Now with video rentals it's all a personal matter .
<user0> Yea , I never see theaters turn people away for their age anymore either .
<user1> Now we have to make a choice about what we will see and what we won't .
<user1> The material is so abstract that I have trouble understanding it .
<user1> Yes , I would like to reserve a room for next Monday .
<user0> Wait a moment , please . Let me check it .
<user1> By the way , I want a large room .
<user0> Right now we have a suite for 4 people , do you want to book it ?
<user1> Yes , that's what I am looking for . I will take the room for 2 days .
<user1> Sorry , I can ' t ! I have to go to work , pick up Jake and Maddie from school , and make them an afternoon snack , then take Jake to soccer practice and Maddie to dance class .
<user0> You sound exhausted . Maybe you should hire a nanny to help you out ! She can pick the kids up and take them to their after-school activities . She can also help you do some household chores , and run so
<user1> Oh , I don ' t know ... it ' s hard to find the right nanny . You have to consider her previous work experience , the responsibilities you give her , and how she interacts with the kids . I would love to have
<user0> I think you should definitely consider it ! This way you won ' t have to juggle such a busy schedule , and you ' ll still get to spend time with the kids in the evenings . I can refer you this great
<user1> Oh , that ' s great . Thanks Grace . Can you give me her number ? I ' ll talk it over with Dan and give her a call tomorrow . Maybe this way I won ' t be so tired every day , and Dan and I might even get to go
<user1> What are you excited about ?
<user0> I voted today .
<user1> Was this your first time ?
<user0> I just turned 18 a month ago .
<user1> You ' re lucky .
<user0> What do you mean ?
<user1> Because you turned 18 in an election year .
<user0> I didn ' t even think of that .
<user1> You didn ' t ?
<user0> I really didn ' t , but I ' m still excited .
<user1> You should be , because you ' re a part of history .
<user1> Yes . I want to buy a pair of shoes .
<user0> Have you a pattern in your mind ?
<user1> Well , maybe sneakers or rubber shoes .
<user0> Is there any special brand you would like ?
<user1> Could I have look at that pair of canvas shoes ? They look nice .
<user1> What's Tiananmen famous for ?
<user0> It is largest pop square in the world.you see that is monument for the people's hero , and the Chairman Mao memorial hall on the south.there is great hall of the people on the west.there are two museums on the east .
<user1> What's that ?
<user0> That's the Forbidden city on the north of Gate building .
<user1> All the sightseeing in china is very attractive and crescive.travelling to China is very worth one.thank you so much for your guides , and I'll miss you .
<user1> We'll have to get you to a hospital . I can ride you on the back of my bike .
<user0> I'm lucky I wasn't killed . I must have been going around forty-five miles an hour.There was too much gravel on that corner . I slid out .
<user1> Yes , I almost slid too.Alright . This tourniquet is tight . How does it feel ?
<user0> Make it tighter . I want the blood stopped.Then wrap some bandages around the cut . Then we can go . Ouch ! I hope I can walk .
<user1> Alright , I'm twisting it around . You tell me when to stop .
<user0> There . Stop !
<user1> Well , unfortunately I have got something to do this weekend . But let me see ...
<user0> Oh , I'm sorry.However , if you could help me out , I'll double the pay for the hours worked .
<user1> That's very kind of you.How soon do you really need them ?
<user0> I'll need them for the conference on Monday afternoon.Do you think it can be done by then ?
<user1> I'll try .
<user0> Thank you very much , Mr.James .
<user1> How can I ever thank you ? I owe you a big favor .
<user1> Sorry to hear that . Can we do anything about it ?
<user0> I'm afraid not .
<user1> Then I have to call another taxi , or I'll be late .
<user1> What ' s the matter with them ?
<user0> Look at the heels . They are slanting .
<user1> Ah , I can do it perfectly .
<user0> How much does it cost ?
<user1> 6 yuan . And I can make them as new as before .
<user0> I think it ' s too expensive . I can just give you 4 yuan . Or I ' ll go to another B .
<user1> All right . I ' ll repair them for you .
<user0> How long will it take ? Could you repair them while I wait ?
<user1> Yes . They will be ready in a few minutes .
<user0> Great ! I ' ll just sit here and wait .
<user1> Hello , Is that Stefan ?
<user0> I'm sorry , but I'm afraid you've dialed the wrong number.There is no Stefan here .
<user1> Really ? Are you sure ? I called before and he was there .
<user0> Yes . I'm sure . You have the wrong number . I have used this number for more than 20 years .
<user1> That can't be true . I remember the number clearly . Is your number 1199886 ?
<user0> No , it isn't . It's 1199866 . It seems that you have misdialed .
<user1> Oh , I'm sorry I bothered you . I'm really sorry .
<user0> It doesn't matter . It happens to everyone .
<user1> Sorry again for bothering you .
<user0> That's all right .
<user1> Good morning . I ' m here to see Rochelle Davis , the Human Resources Manager .
<user0> Do you have an appointment with her ?
<user1> Yes , I do . I have a 10:00 appointment with her this morning .
<user0> Okay . What ' s your name , please ?
<user1> My name is Bruce Green .
<user0> Thanks . Please sit down . She ' ll be with you shortly .
<user1> Thank you .
<user1> Oh , it ' s almost eleven twenty .
<user0> Thank you .
<user1> You ' re welcome . The rain is quite heavy , isn ' t it ?
<user0> Yeah . I was in a hurry and I forgot my umbrella today .
<user1> I have one . We could share it . Which way are you going ?
<user0> Oh , that ' s very kind of you . I am going to the Garden Hotel .
<user1> I am going there , too . We can walk together .
<user0> Sure .
<user1> We have a great variety of Chinese antiques . Besides , we have landscape painting , figure painting and flower-and-bird painting .
<user0> I'd like a flower-and-bird painting .
<user1> How about this picture of cranes with pine trees ? It was painted by a famous Chinese painter in King Dynasty .
<user0> Oh , they look just like live cranes .
<user1> And what is more , in traditional Chinese thinking , cranes and pine trees symbolize longevity .
<user1> Yes , it's $ 167 .
<user0> Thank you .
<user1> It looks wonderful . Very authentic .
<user0> The chef trained in Florence . The pasta is very good here .
<user1> OK . So , what can you recommend ?
<user0> Hum ... You should try the mushroom fettucine . It's really good .
<user1> Is it salty ?
<user0> Not at all . It has a very delicate flavor .
<user1> What does ' Duppa del Giono ' mean ? I'm sorry I don't know how to pronounce that .
<user0> Oh , that means soup of the day . I'll ask the waiter what they have today . Have you tried mussels cooked the Italian way ? They're really delicious .
<user1> No . I'll try them . Sounds good .
<user1> Anything you would like to know ?
<user0> What qualities do you expect the applicants to have ?
<user1> We expect the usher girl to be good-looking , no less than 165 centimeters high , and love smiling .
<user1> Yes , actually I ' m looking to buy a camera .
<user0> We ' Ve got a wide selection do you know if you ' d like a point-and-shoot , or something a little fancier ? Are you shopping for yourself or for someone else ?
<user1> Actually I ' m buying a camera for my husband .
<user0> Ah , well then I ' d recommend a nice entry-level digital SLR .
<user1> Yeah ? Can I take a look at the Sirs you carry ?
<user0> Sure thing , follow me . This here is the .
<user1> The Canon Eos . Yeah it ' s ok , but I ' m looking for something that performs better in low light , has a better display panel , and longer battery life .
<user0> Oh , ah , um the Nikon D60 is a nice option .
<user1> Yeah , but what kit lens does this camera come with ? I don ' t want some bulky telephoto lens .
<user0> Oh , well this one has the , uh .
<user1> Looks to me like an 18-55 mm lens . pretty standard , that will do . Not like my husband will be stalking celebrities or anything !
<user0> So , ahem , can I interest you in any acc ...
<user1> Accessories ? Do you carry polarizing filters ?
<user0> Polarizing filter um we should ! I ' m sorry , ma ' am . It looks like we ' re sold out .
<user1> No you ' re not ! There are some right here !
<user0> Oh , well , would you look at that ! Polarizing filters .
<user1> Thanks for your help , Ralph !
<user0> No problem , ma ' am .
<user1> Please , where do I catch the plane for New York ?
<user0> First you must check in at Counter No . 4 .
<user1> That one there ?
<user0> That's right . Then you will follow the signs to Gate 85 .
<user1> Thank you . You ' Ve been very helpful .
<user1> That ' s certainly true . But , that ' s what this job is all about , Maria . There's no doubt that this project is unacceptable .
<user0> I agree . But I think that we can handle the problem by making a few major changes . I ' d appreciate it if you would give me a chance .
<user1> All right , Maria . I ' ll give you until tomorrow at 4:00 to produce a satisfactory piece of work , but otherwise , you ' ll have to re-do it .
<user1> You do ? How are you going to contact him ?
<user0> I'm leaving him a message taped to my computer screen .
<user1> What does it say ? Do you think he'll see it ?
<user0> He'll see it . It says , I like sweets . Meet me at two thirty in the parking lot .
<user1> Can I spy on you guys from the window ?
<user0> No . But I'll fill you in later . Right now I have to find Vince .
<user1> I'd like to have some more . It's really good .
<user1> No , you'll have to get off at the bank , and take a No . 50 .
<user0> Thank you.How much is the fare to that stop ?
<user1> One dollar .
<user0> How many stops are there ?
<user1> Two stops after this one .
<user0> Could you please tell me when we get there ?
<user1> Sure .
<user0> By the way , do I need a transfer again after No . 50 ?
<user1> No , a No . 50 will take you right there .
<user0> Thank you .
<user1> Very well . We started organizing everything early to avoid a last minute rush to get things done . The only thing that isn ' t ready yet is my wedding dress .
<user0> When will that be ready ?
<user1> The dressmakers said that is would be ready in two weeks .
<user0> You ' re getting married in three weeks . So that should be ok . So , you ' Ve prepared the church , catering , transport , hotel-everything .
<user1> Yes . We ' Ve taken care of all of that . We decided not to get married in a church though . Neither of us is very religious .
<user0> Which hotel will the reception be held at ?
<user1> The palace hotel they ' re taking care of the catering , including the wedding cake . I ' m sure they ' ll do a good job .
<user0> Oh , yes . It ' s and excellent hotel . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive .
<user1> Yes . It will be expensive , but we think it will be worth it . It gives us great peace of mind to know that our reception is in the hands of experienced people .
<user0> I think you make the right decision .
<user1> Yes . Actually our range of sweaters is the most comprehensive available .
<user0> Can I try this one on ?
<user1> Sure , go ahead .
<user0> The color is too bright.For my age , I would prefer a lighter color .
<user1> Coffee ? I don ' t honestly like that kind of stuff .
<user0> Come on , you can at least try a little , besides your cigarette .
<user1> What ' s wrong with that ? Cigarette is the thing I go crazy for .
<user0> Not for me , Dick .
<user1> Let's see , sir . According to your file , you watched ' Titanic ' Monday evening .
<user0> Well , the wrong information is in my file . I was at a concert Monday night .
<user1> Well , your word overrules the file , sir . One moment , please .
<user0> I knew you'd see it my way .
<user1> Sir , I deleted the $ 10 , but I had to add a $ 2 service charge to your bill .
<user0> Am I in the Twilight Zone ? You're charging me for a movie I never saw ?
<user1> Please don't blame me , sir . Blame the computer programmer .
<user0> This is highway robbery . I've got a good mind to call the police !
<user1> If it makes you feel any better , other guests feel the same way .
<user1> How nice of him . I'll be delighted to go . But what time would be convenient ?
<user0> If you could be ready by , say 6:30 o'clock , I'll be at the hotel to pick you up .
<user1> That's great . It's most thoughtful of you to do this , Miss Rose .
<user0> It's my pleasure . Well , then . I'll say goodbye .
<user1> Goodbye and see you tonight . Miss Rose .
<user1> Sorry , but he's not in . May I take a message for you ?
<user0> This is Robert Jordan.Would you ask him to call me back , please ?
<user1> OK , I'll tell him .
<user1> Yes , of course . Here it is .
<user0> Thank you . Are all these yours ?
<user1> No , some of them are my friend's . Do you want her passport , too ?
<user0> Yes , please . Do you have any carry-on items ?
<user1> Do you want me to put it on the belt , too ?
<user0> Yes , please . Would you please open this big suitcase ?
<user1> OK . Just a moment . It's just some clothes and toiletries .
<user0> OK . Do you have anything to declare ?
<user1> I think there is nothing .
<user0> Any fresh food , live plants , or animals ?
<user1> Oh , no . None of that .
<user0> Thank you . You may lock up your suitcase . Here are your passports .
<user1> Thanks a lot .
<user1> Yes ?
<user0> I bought it one size up by mistake .
<user1> Oh , did you ?
<user0> I wonder if you can change it to one size down .
<user1> Yes , of course.Will you come with the receipt ?
<user0> Then I'll come to your place later in the evening , and how late is your shop open ?
<user1> Until 8 o'clock , ma'am . We are looking forward to seeing you .
<user1> No idea . Your guess is as good as mine .
<user0> It better be more than last year .
<user1> Well , anything is better than nothing . Wait and see .
<user1> Why , do we need groceries ?
<user0> I believe we are all out of food .
<user1> Do you know what to get ?
<user0> I don't know what we need .
<user1> Why don't you go and check the refrigerator ?
<user0> I would appreciate it if you would do that for me .
<user1> Why don't you just get the basics ?
<user0> What do you mean ?
<user1> Eggs , milk , bread . Things like that .
<user0> Go make that list .
<user1> Sure , no problem .
<user1> Since we have reached an agreement on all terms , there shouldn't be any problems for the contract .
<user0> May we once more remind you that the contract should be canceled by one month notice .
<user1> Yes , I got it . Thanks .
<user1> Yes , can I help you ?
<user0> Well , this is my baggage claim tag . Can you get my baggage now ?
<user1> OK , here you are .
<user0> Thanks a lot .
<user1> I was unable to make it .
<user0> You should have been there . It was intense .
<user1> Is that right . Who ended up winning ?
<user0> Our team was victorious .
<user1> I wish I was free that night . I'm kind of mad that I didn't go .
<user0> It was a great game .
<user1> What was the score at the end of the game ?
<user0> Our team won 101-98 .
<user1> Sounds like it was a close game .
<user0> That's the reason it was such a great game .
<user1> The next game , I will definitely be there .
<user1> No , never . I prefer to actually see and touch what I'm buying before I pay for it , especially for clothes and shoes .
<user0> That's right . Seeing is believing .
<user1> I've heard some friends say when they get the article , it's quite different from what they see on the website advertisement .
<user0> That happens . Without close quality examination , we may encounter fraud , and the e-shop may suddenly disappear .
<user1> What's more , it's not always so safe for us to pay online as hackers might steal the user name and password .
<user0> It's said that some measures have been taken to deal with this problem . Paying online is much safer than before , but I still have the feeling that it's not safe enough .
<user1> I can't agree more . that's why I only do street shopping .
<user0> Me too . Sometimes I surf online shops to check some related information , and then go to a physical store to do the actual shopping .
<user1> That's a good idea .
<user1> It is 15 minutes ' drive .
<user0> What companies do we have in our neighborhood ?
<user1> Mitsubishi , HP , IBM and many other famous corporations .
<user0> Does the 7th floor belong to our company too ?
<user1> Yes , our company has two floors , the 6th and 7th floor in this building .
<user0> It ' s such a large firm . Do we have our own staff restaurant ?
<user1> Yes , at the end of the hall .
<user1> Good morning , I have an appointment with Mr . Johnson at 10:00
<user0> Excuse me , sir , but are you Mr . Richard of World Trading Company ?
<user1> Yes . That ' s right .
<user0> I ' m sorry , Mr . Richard . Mr . Johnson is on his way to the office . He had just called and asked you to wait a minute .
<user1> Well , I ' ll wait .
<user0> Would you like something to drink , sir ? Do you prefer coffee or tea ?
<user1> Thank you . Coffee , please .
<user0> Here you are , Mr . Richard . This is the cream and this is the sugar . If there ' s anything else you ' d like , please don ' t hesitate to tell me .
<user1> Thank you very much .
<user1> I need to report a break-in .
<user0> When did this break-in occur ?
<user1> Last night .
<user0> Where did the break-in happen ?
<user1> It happened at my house .
<user0> Was anything taken ?
<user1> I'm not sure yet .
<user0> What makes you think there was a break-in ?
<user1> My front window was busted .
<user0> I'll send a squad car .
<user1> Please hurry .
<user1> You don't need to introduce yourself , Yang . You're famous .
<user0> Well , thank you very much but I thought l'd try and chair the meeting by the rule — at least for a while .
<user1> OK , OK !
<user0> Now , I'd like to get things under way . The main topic on today's agenda is the development of a U . S . sales strategy for the new EBB . I'd like to hear all of your ideas , Mr . Wall , you seem in top form today . Could you start the ball rolling ?
<user1> Uh , oh , sure . Well , I think we should keep in mind that the key to good sales is advertising .
<user0> Well , that's kind of obvious .
<user1> Give me a break , Mr Yang .
<user0> Uh , let's keep this going , shall we ?
<user1> What do you mean ?
<user0> It looks like the shipping company did this .
<user1> We'd better take it up with them , in that case .
<user1> No problem , if possible I always combine business with pleasure . Now , let ' s hear more about these chocolates you ' re offering .
<user0> Well , as you know , I have recently become the sole distributor for Grangers Gourmet Bon-bons here in the United States . They ' re a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . Naturally , your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately . I think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as Grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant , luxurious , first class dining .
<user1> Mmmm , sounds interesting ... gourmet chocolates , where are they produced ? Belgium ?
<user0> Actually , the factory is located in Scotland .
<user1> Really ? I didn ' t think they were known for their luxury chocolate production
<user0> That ' s what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! The government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . They ' Ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . Here , I brought these especially for you , try one !
<user1> Oh , thanks . Mmm , hmm , creamy texture , very smooth ...
<user0> Unique , aren ' t they ? I bet you ' Ve never tasted anything like it ! Quality is assured as I personally visit the factory to make sure no one ' s cutting corners with the ingredients . Only the creme make it through inspection .
<user1> Yes , very interesting flavors ... Slightly spicy , very unique , that ' s for sure . Exactly what ARE the ingredients ?
<user0> I have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the Granger family for generations . I ' m sure you can keep a secret . Buttermilk , cacao beans , sugar and Haggis .
<user1> Haggis ? What ' s Haggis ?
<user0> It ' s a traditional Scottish delicacy , you take sheep ' s liver , heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep ' s stomach .
<user1> Ah , get back to you .
<user0> Mr . Johnson ? Mr . Johnson ?
<user1> Yes , we are just looking for one . What's the charge per day ?
<user0> It's $ 20 . If you are staying for more than 3 days in the city , the charge is $ 16 per day .
<user1> That's reasonable .
<user1> Yes , that's right .
<user0> I believe we met at a concert last year . I'm Taylor .
<user1> Oh , yes . I remember .
<user1> Monica , wait a moment . I think we ' d better call the repair man to do it .
<user0> I think I can handle it by myself .
<user1> I ' d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company .
<user0> I see . If I got hurt when fixing the light , even during office hours , I wouldn ' t get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility .
<user1> Other company rules also need your attention .
<user0> Like this one ? Never wear loose clothes or hair when operating the shredder.Yeah , thank you for telling me .
<user1> Don ' t mention it .
<user1> When did you finish ?
<user0> This morning ! No more overtime , and no more headaches !
<user1> Well , I ' m glad to hear it . Have a cup of coffee !
<user1> Did you mail us your last Continued Claim Form ?
<user0> I am afraid that I forgot to send it in .
<user1> We cannot pay you unless you turn that form in every two weeks .
<user0> Is it too late to mail the Continued Claim Form in now ?
<user1> It can ' t be more than fourteen days late for us to accept it .
<user0> I will mail it in a little early next time to avoid this problem .
<user1> You can ' t possibly know in advance how much you will be working . If you mail it in too soon , we will reject it !
<user0> Will my paycheck arrive late because I messed up on my form ?
<user1> Your check will be arriving late , but the next one will come right on time .
<user1> I'm ready when you are , sir .
<user0> Very good ! Now , it's still morning here in New York .
<user1> You are so right , sir . The clock just struck nine .
<user0> I'm going to spend some time exploring the city . What can I do with my luggage ?
<user1> Sir , right here we have a storage site . Its only $ 5 an hour , but you need to leave a deposit .
<user0> A deposit ? Isn't my luggage a deposit ?
<user1> I'm sorry , sir , but it isn't . Your MasterCard or VISA will take care of things nicely .
<user0> Okay . Let me think about this .
<user1> Okay , sir . But don't take too long . You only have 30 minutes .
<user1> Yes . I'd like a cup of onion soup .
<user0> And what would you like after that ?
<user1> I'd like the roast chicken , please .
<user1> Yes , I know and I like it very much . I will take it .
<user0> Sure . Here is your receipt .
<user1> How long is this cell phone guaranteed ?
<user0> You can refund it in 7 days and exchange it in one year .
<user1> It was alright . I ran into Bill and we got to talking for a while . He ' s in a bit of a jam .
<user0> Why ? What happened ?
<user1> Well , his son had an accident and Bill doesn ' t have health insurance . This really got me thinking , and I wondered if we shouldn ' t look into a couple of different HMO ' s .
<user0> Yeah , you ' re right . We aren ' t getting any younger and our kids are getting older .
<user1> Exactly ! I searched on the web and found a couple of HMO ' s with low co-pays and good coverage . The deductibles are low , too .
<user0> Sounds good , although , do you think we can qualify for insurance ? Those insurance companies are real pirates when it comes to money .
<user1> Well , we don ' t have any pre-existing illnesses or conditions , so we should be fine .
<user0> I wish our company or country provided us with healthcare .
<user1> Not in a million years !
<user1> Yes , of course . There are many steps . You can apply for the job on the Internet and then send your resume to the e-mail address of the company . And wail the feedback of the company .
<user0> What is the qualification needed by the position ?
<user1> You must have over 2 years'experience first .
<user1> Played poker with my work friends .
<user0> Did you win ?
<user1> Of course .
<user1> Can I see your passbook and the withdrawal slip , please ?
<user0> Sure .
<user1> Let me just make sure . You want to withdraw one thousand dollars ?
<user0> That's right .
<user1> Yes of course . This is a really good one actually .
<user0> How much does it cost ?
<user1> This one is 1500 yuan .
<user0> It looks pretty good . I think I'll take it .
<user1> Would you like anything else ?
<user0> That's all thank you .
<user1> What is that ? It looks like something from a swamp !
<user0> It's a green drink . It's supposed to be full of vitamins and minerals .
<user1> You know , healthy eating doesn't have to make you gag .
<user0> The sales lady said that even if I eat right , I wouldn't get enough vitamins .
<user1> Have you ever tried it ? Or are you just going to believe the sales lady ?
<user0> It's easier to drink this once a day than eat fruit and vegetables all day .
<user1> It may take less time , but I don't know about easier . Yuck .
<user1> I'm sorry I'm late . I overslept . Is the manager here today ?
<user0> Yes he ' s in his office .
<user1> Oh , I hope he didn't notice me .
<user0> Don't take any chances . It'd be best if you told him and promised not to be late again . He's already mad at you for last 2 times . Any more and he might fire you .
<user1> You said it . It won't happen again . Do you really think he'd fire me ?
<user0> I think he might . You'd better go to his office .
<user1> You are probably right . I'll go right now and apologize . I try hard not to be late but it is difficult with Beijing traffic .
<user0> Good luck !
<user1> The rent is $ 1500 per month .
<user0> And how much is the deposit ?
<user1> The deposit is $ 500 .
<user1> There is the Balance of Net Liabilities . This must not exceed its net assets and no business loss can be shown during the past two years .
<user0> Right , OK . That , again , shouldn't be a problem .

<user1> Here are some.They ' re on special sale these days .
<user0> That's more reasonable . I'll take this one .
<user1> I'm looking for some earrings for my wife as a wedding anniversary gift .
<user0> You've come to the right store . We've got a beautiful and wide selection of earrings for you to choose from .

<user0> Why ? anything special there ?
<user1> It's more than special . You can find as many kinds of animals as you can put a name to and more .
<user0> Oh , really ? are there any snakes ?
<user1> Snakes ? there are even rodents and monkeys ! it's a world of exotic pets .
<user0> That's terrific . I can't wait to check it out .
<user1> Hang on . are you sure you want to keep a non-traditional pet ?
<user0> Why not ? it's so cool .
<user1> But it will pose a risk to your health .
<user0> Pardon ?
<user1> I mean , most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria , they are likely to cause immune system problems .
<user0> Well , I didn't realize that .
<user1> I don't believe it's a good choice to keep those pets , especially for families with young children .
<user0> Oh , I should have thought of my brother's baby girl . Maybe I'll just have a dog instead of an exotic pet .
<user1> Yes , good luck , Maria .
<user1> Hold on a minute , please .
<user0> Thank you .
<user1> I am sorry to have kept you waiting . Mr . Johns needs a telephone call from you .
<user0> Would you bring the message to my room .
<user1> I'm afraid we have nobody available at the moment .
<user0> Then I'll come down and pick up the message immediately .
<user1> OK , we wait for you .
<user1> what is it ?
<user0> well , you know how I've been working at the Economist as a proof-reader , right ?
<user1> yes .
<user0> well , the editor-in-chief heard that I had experience as an editor at another magadize and asked me if I was interested in becoming an assistant editor for him .
<user1> really ? That's fantastic ! Will you get a chance to do any writing ?
<user0> she said that the columnist for the literary criticism column would be going on pregnancy leave soon and that I could be in charge of the column until she came back .
<user1> wow ! That's really great news . How often does the magazine come out ?
<user0> it's a monthly magazine , but my column will be shared with another columnist so my articles will be due fortnightly .
<user1> are you looking forward to doing more editing work ?
<user0> yes , but I'm even more excited about getting my thoughts published again !
<user1> do you have any order forms here so that I can get a subscription to the magazine ?
<user0> I don't have any with me , but I think I could manage to bring a free copy home for you .
<user1> I'm really looking forward to reading your column .
<user0> me , too . Do you want to go out to celebrate my good news ?
<user1> sure , where would you like to go ?
<user0> perhaps we could go to the library festival that's going on at the local bookshop .
<user1> I think I may have seen it on the kitchen table .
<user0> you're right , thanks . There's an interesting interview with a top director about his latest film that I want to finish .
<user1> who's the director ?
<user0> it's Martin Scorsese . You liked his film , The Departed , didn't you ?
<user1> yes , it was fantastic ! Can I read the article when you're finished ?
<user0> sure . You know it has an online edition , too . You should go online to read if you want to read it now .
<user1> that's ok . I'll wait until you're finished . Just out of curiosity , do you have a subscription for that magadize ?
<user0> no . I don't buy it regularly enough for it to be worthwhile .
<user1> how much does the magadize cost ?
<user0> it's almost three pounds now , and I think they're going to put the price up to four pounds soon .
<user1> that's quite expensive . Who is their target audience ?
<user0> Cosmo mainly has a middle-class readership , but I think circulation will fall dramatically if the price goes up anymore .
<user1> I bet you'll still buy it , though . You wouldn't be able to live without your fashion magazine !
<user1> Bargain ? I'd feel way too guilty .
<user0> But you could have saved money .
<user1> From a sweet ma ? ! It's not worth it . Plus , I'd happily pay more for these things I bought !
<user0> F . Y . I . , there is a flea market nearby , but maybe you're done ...
<user1> Ha ! I'm just warming up ! Please take me there now !
<user1> Sure . What do you want to find ?
<user0> I want to find information on the American Civil War .
<user1> Well , can you be more specific ? There are a lot of websites about that .
<user0> Yes , I want to know about the battle of Gettysburg .
<user1> O . K . Well , go to google.com , and type in “ Battle of Gettysburg . ”
<user0> Oh wow , there are a lot of sites .
<user1> Here , try this one . It ' s a good site about Gettysburg .
<user0> Thanks .
<user1> For detailed information , however , you should read a history book .
<user0> Thanks . If I ' m interested , I ' ll go to the library .
<user1> OK . You ' d better come back in two hours .
<user1> I'm afraid he's away from his desk at the moment .
<user0> Do you know when he will be back ?
<user1> He's away on a business trip . He won't be back until some time next week .
<user0> Is there some way I can get into contact with him ?
<user1> The best way to reach him is by cell phone . I'll give you his number .
<user0> Thanks . And could I have his e-mail , just in case I can't get him by phone ?
<user1> Sure . His cell phone is 09112223 33 . And his e-mail is lower case t , smith--that's one word , at , c , c , w , dot , com , dot , t , w .
<user0> Thank you so much . Does he read his e-mails daily ?
<user1> Yes . He usually replies immediately .
<user0> Great . Thanks again . You've been very helpful .
<user1> My pleasure . I hope you get a hold of him .
<user1> I'm in pretty bad shape , Dr . Ford .
<user0> Oh , in what way ?
<user1> No appetite , always on edge , and I can't sleep well .
<user0> Did you lose any weight ?
<user1> Yes , I have lost quite a few pounds since last month .
<user0> When was the last time you had a check-up ?
<user1> About two month ago .
<user0> Let me take your blood pressure . You look anemic .
<user1> Well , Mr . Brown , I'm happy to say it's nothing serious .
<user0> You're just a little run-down from overwork .
<user1> What am I supposed to do ?
<user0> I think all you need is just a vacation .
<user1> Try to get outdoors more and be sure to get more rest .
<user0> Thank you , doctor . I'll do as you say .
<user1> Morning , Michael . I ' Ve been very busy lately . One of our other vendors is going out of business and I ' Ve been searching for a suitable replacement .
<user0> Well , rest assured that you can count on us to be here for the long run , sitdown.Coffee ?
<user1> No , thanks . I ' Ve been trying to cut down on the caffeine .
<user0> Haha , I could never do that . I ' d be a zombie if I didn ' t have my morning coffee fix . Let ' s get down to business then .
<user1> Yes . I ' Ve come to talk with you about ordering the eight megapixel cameras for our new methone . The demand for phone cameras is growing , and Pear has been falling behind in the market .
<user0> That ' s great ! I ' m glad to hear that Pear has finally jumped on the bandwagon . Right now our contract is for the five megapixel cameras . Is Pear still interested in having those ?
<user1> No , we ' re changing all the cameras to eight megapixels . We were hoping that by making your company our sole supplier for cameras we could negotiate a better deal .
<user0> Surely . Let ' s get started by drafting a new contract .
<user1> You have ordered a red dress , is that right ?
<user0> Yes . Is that available now ?
<user1> Yes , here you are . Try it in front of the mirror .
<user1> Did I hear about it ? I saw it happen .
<user0> Are you serious ?
<user1> I was there .
<user0> What happened ?
<user1> A man came into the bank with a gun .
<user0> That's insane .
<user1> I was so scared when I saw the gun .
<user0> Then what happened ?
<user1> He took the money and tried to get away .
<user0> Did the cops show up in time ?
<user1> He didn't even make it out the door .
<user1> hello ! I was exhausted form studying , so I decided to read the newspaper to relax . Unfortunately , the news is so depressing . There has been another murder in the city center . I ' m shocked that the pole
<user0> people are starting to get frightened by it . Everyone will be relieved when they finally catch the murder .
<user1> you mean if they catch the murderer . I ' m scared stiff about going into the city center at night .
<user0> there must have been some good news in the newspaper . I can ' t believe that none of the news stories make you happy or excited .
<user1> well , there was one good piece of news . You remember the local girl who was dying of a rare blood disease ?
<user0> yes . Her parents were raising money to have her treated in the united states .
<user1> well , they ' Ve got the money and she ' s going tomorrow for treatment .
<user0> I ' m so happy for the family ! They must be very relieved and excited about that .
<user1> I ' m sure they are . Oh , and a local man won the lottery . I ' m so jealous ! I wish it were me ! I buy a lottery ticket every week and I ' m amazed that I haven ' t even won a small prize yet . It ' s so unfair !
<user0> don ' t be moody ! I hope you ' re not tired , because we ' Ve been invited to a party this evening . I know how excited you get about parties .
<user1> Let me see . The bell-bottom pants are $ 90 and the coat is $ 120 . It comes to $ 210 .
<user0> Is it possible for you to reduce the price ?
<user1> I am sorry . It's a one-price shop .
<user1> Yes , I've been waiting for my bags to be sent up for the last half hour . Where are they ?
<user0> I'm very sorry to hear that . May I have your name and room number , please ?
<user1> Yes , it's Yao Lan . Room 406 .
<user0> And how many pieces did you have ?
<user1> Two suitcases and a handbag . The suitcases are blue and the shoulder bag is red .
<user0> Is there a name tag attached to them ?
<user1> Yes , there is .
<user0> We're very sorry for the delay . I'll check immediately and call you back .
<user1> Yes.May I have some more beer ?
<user0> Oh , sure . I'll be back in a minute.Thank you for waiting . Here it is.Did you enjoy your meal ?
<user1> Yes , the meal was very delicious and I enjoyed very much . I'm full .
<user0> Is that so ? I'm glad you enjoyed it .
<user1> By the way , Miss.Where is the toilet ?
<user0> Toilets are in the rear . I'm afraid all the toilets are fully occupied at the moment .
<user1> What ?
<user1> I attend an aerobic class three times a week .
<user0> Aren't you tired ?
<user1> No , I feel young , fresh and energetic .
<user1> No , this isn't .
<user0> Could you please get him on the phone ?
<user1> Sure . Wait a minute .
<user1> Why don't you wear a scarf ?
<user0> What can wearing one do for me ?
<user1> You're cold because the wind is blowing into your open collar . It's not because your jacket isn't thick enough .
<user0> So wearing a scarf helps your body to stay warm inside your jacket .
<user1> Yes . That's the secret to wearing a thin jacket .
<user0> You know , sometimes I can't feel my ears and fingers .
<user1> I'll lend you my gloves and earmuffs until you get your own .
<user0> Thanks , Pam . You're my lifesaver .
<user1> The most important thing to do is to make sure you know the company and what services or products it provides . Do you know all about them ?
<user0> Yes , I pretty much understand the company .
<user1> Well , after you've done your research , you have to decide whether the company is casual or formal . Have you decided what they are yet ?
<user0> Yes , I've been observing them .
<user1> When you are choosing what to wear , keep all of that in mind . Have you chosen what to wear ?
<user0> I already have something to wear .
<user1> I would always be ready to go shopping with you ! Should we talk about other basics ?
<user0> OK , I am ready to think of other things .
<user1> You need to make sure you arrive on time , smile , be pleasant and friendly , look the person in the eye and answer all questions to the best of your ability . You'll do great !
<user1> Would you please show me that mural ?
<user0> Certainly . Here you are .
<user1> It looks so beautiful . How much is it ?
<user0> Four hundred yuan .
<user1> That's a bit more than I wanted to pay . Can you cut the price down a bit ?
<user0> I'm sorry . Ours is a fixed price shop and I can assure you this is the best price you can get for a mural like this .
<user1> Maybe you are right . OK , I'll take it .
<user0> Well , I'll have it wrapped for you .
<user1> Thank you . Here is four hundred yuan .
<user0> Thank you . Please come again .
<user1> We ' re glad that you ' re here . Would you like a tour of the house ?
<user0> That ' d be great , but could I have a cup of tea first ?
<user1> Sure , I ' ll just go put the kettle on . Why don ' t you have a seat on the sofa and I ' ll go take care of things in the kitchen .
<user0> That would be lovely , thanks .
<user1> Do you take milk or sugar with your tea ?
<user0> I ' ll take a little milk , but no sugar , please . Make sure you let the tea steep a few minutes before you take the tea bag out of the cup .
<user1> Ok . What do you think about our living room ?
<user0> Well , I do like the mantelpiece and the coffee table , but I don ' t really care for curtains . Did you get them at a yard sale ? They look ancient .
<user1> My parents gave them to us as a house warming gift .
<user0> Oh dear . Well , I suppose they will do for now . do you ever dust in here ? It seems a bit dusty in here .
<user1> Your daughter usually does the dusting , and I do the vacuuming .
<user0> I see . Well , I can help with the chores while I ' m here . You two could probably use my help .
<user1> That ' s very nice of you to offer . Here ' s your tea . Be careful , it ' s still quite hot .
<user1> I feel sorry for you . It's a jungle out there .
<user0> Do you know any places ?
<user1> well . I guess I can ask around to see if anyone's got a room or apartment available .
<user0> thank you . I think I should also have a look at the Internet to see if anyone's got a sublet .
<user1> how much do are you looking to spend ?
<user0> I can only afford about 1,000 yuan a month .
<user1> looks like you'll have to get a place in the suburbs .
<user0> it doesn't matter , but it needs to be close to the subway or on a convenient bus route .
<user1> anything you need to have in the place ?
<user0> I want a bedroom with full bath , and it'll be better if the bedroom is on the sunny side .
<user1> you can also check out university bulletin boards .
<user0> why ? Will those be students who are leaving ?
<user1> not really , but landlords put up notices to attract students and they often have low rent .
<user0> thank you . I'll be sure to take a look .
<user1> good luck .
<user1> Hi , I'd like to order some flowers .
<user0> Who are they for ?
<user1> They're for my Wife . Her name is Samantha .
<user0> What kind of flowers would you like ?
<user1> I don't know . I don't know too much about flowers . Can you recommend something ?
<user0> OK . What's the reason you are sending her flowers ?
<user1> Today's her birthday and she told me she wants me to buy her flowers .
<user0> Do you know what kind of flowers she likes ?
<user1> I'm not sure . I know I should know that , but I can't remember right now .
<user0> Well , they're for your wife , so I think you should give her roses .
<user1> Roses will be fine .
<user0> What color ?
<user1> I think red would be nice .
<user0> Do you want to pick them up or should we deliver them ?
<user1> Can you deliver them , please ?
<user0> What's the address ?
<user1> 241 Main street .
<user1> Why don't you try Chinese herbal medicine ?
<user0> Is it useful for me ?
<user1> You have to try at least .
<user0> OK . Thanks a lot .
<user1> That's nothing .
<user1> I need to take a few classes .
<user0> What kind of classes would you like to take ?
<user1> How about a driver's course ?
<user0> Okay , you're going to need to make an appointment .
<user1> I don't understand why I need to make an appointment .
<user0> You need to make one to come down and fill out your paperwork .
<user1> I'd like to make one now if I could .
<user0> Sure you can ; when would you like to come in ?
<user1> I'd like to come in tomorrow morning at 9
<user0> That'll be fine .
<user1> That's great . Thank you very much .
<user1> Hello . I would like to speak to your director of human resources , Ms.Jenkins , Please .
<user0> Just a moment . I'll check to see if she is at her desk.May I tell her who is calling ?
<user1> This is Bill Burton from Milford Insurance , I'm calling in regards to our meeting next Tuesday .
<user0> Thank you , Mr.Burton.Can you please hold for a moment ? I'll check to see if she is available .
<user1> No problem .
<user0> I'm sorry , Ms.Jenkins is away from her desk.She has already left for lunch.Would you like to leave a message for her ?
<user1> Better , thank you , doctor .
<user0> Can I see him please , Mrs Williams ?
<user1> Certainly , doctor . Come upstairs .
<user0> You look very well , Jimmy . You are better now , but you mustn't get up yet.You must stay in bed for another two days.The boy mustn't go to school yet , Mrs Williams . And he mustn't eat rich food .
<user1> Does he have a temperature , doctor ?
<user0> No , he doesn ' t .
<user1> Must he stay in bed ?
<user0> Yes . He must remain in bed for another two days . He can get up for about two hours each day , but you must keep the room warm . Where's Mr Williams this evening ?
<user1> He's in bed , doctor . Can you see him , please ? He has a bad cold , too !
<user1> What would you like to know , Mr . Green ?
<user0> What working experience have you get ?
<user1> In 2004 , I got a job in the sales department of a trading company near Guangzhou . I started a sales representative . A year later , I was promoted to the position of sales manager . I had that job ever since , which is just over a year now .
<user0> Oh , good . Irene , can you tell me why you plan to quit being a sales manager to work here as my assistant ? Don't you like your present job ?
<user1> Frankly , some part of it I enjoy very much , but I prefer something more professional . It happens that I have a friend working here in this company . She told me the export department was to recruit an assistant . I felt very excited at this news . That's why I'm here .
<user1> Yes , it's very nice . All our foreign visitors enjoy it . The food is wonderfully well-prepared . Let me know if you need any help with the menu .
<user0> Thank you . Mmm . Can you tell me about the terrine ?
<user1> Yes . A terrine is a kind of meat pate . It's meat turned into a paste . It sounds horrible but it's actually really good .
<user0> Mmm . Maybe another time .
<user1> You could try the ravioli . They are rather like your Chinese dumplings , and the sauce is delicious .
<user0> Sounds good . I think I'll have the lamb for my main course . What does it come with ?
<user1> Well , you can have fries-French fries-or simple boiled potatoes .
<user0> I'll have the potatoes . What are you having ?
<user1> I'm having my usual . I like the fish here . Would you like some wine ?
<user0> Oh , yes . That would be lovely .
<user1> Would you like those with yogurt ?
<user0> Sure , why not ?
<user1> What else would you like to add ? We highly recommend caterpillar fungus .
<user0> Caterpillar fungus ? ! What the heck is that ?
<user1> It ' s a special kind of Chinese herb . It ' s good for you !
<user1> What's so great about it ?
<user0> What do you mean ? It's a scrim .
<user1> Not to me , I wouldn't be caught dead in that .
<user0> I love that kind of stuff .
<user1> Yeah , you seem to like those styles .
<user0> Sure do . I get a kick out of looking punk .
<user1> This one looks really expensive though .
<user0> I don't care how much it costs . I'm rolling in it .
<user1> Lucky you ! I can't buy anything else . I'm flat broke .
<user0> I got a replace my party outfit , I trashed it last week .
<user1> Why did you drag me into this ? I've spent a week salary .
<user0> Are you on the level ? You're the one who called me , remember ?
<user1> Just joking , Tonia . I've got some wonderful clothes . Let's go and have a close look at your outfit .
<user1> We have thought of you carefully with discretion , but the other candidate has more experiences .
<user0> Experience is important , but don't you think capability is more valuable than that ?
<user1> Yes , I think so . But how do you prove to me that you are more capable ?
<user0> Maybe you can hire me on trial . If I'm not qualified for the job , you can let me go .
<user1> Good idea .
<user1> Yes , the nearest one is at the third cross of this road .
<user0> I'm a stranger here.How can I get there , please ?
<user1> Just walk down the road for a few minutes , and you'll find it on your right .
<user0> Thank you very much .
<user1> So , this 500 RIB is worthless ?
<user0> I'm sorry but it is our regulation , so I must follow it . We will issue you with a receipt to show that the notes you presented us with are counterfeit and have been confiscated . Then , if you wish to pay in some more cash , you are free to do so .
<user1> Right , I see . Let me give you another 500 RIB .
<user0> Here's your Passbook back and the receipt to say we confiscated the 500 RIB worth of counterfeit notes .
<user1> Thanks . Now can I make the full deposit ?
<user0> Yes . Please fill in a new deposit slip and we can continue .
<user1> Do we have to ?
<user0> Come on , it ' s losing needles all the time and the branches are sagging .
<user1> It ' s not that bad , besides it really looks nice in that corner . It gives the room a good atmosphere .
<user0> A good atmosphere ? The tree is falling apart , and it ' s messing up the room .
<user1> But it makes the place feel so much like Christmas . I ' d really hate to have to take it down .
<user0> But Christmas was two weeks ago ! It ' s been there only because we ' Ve been too busy to get rid of it .
<user1> I know , but it seems like such a shame to have to take it away .
<user0> But it ' s falling apart , and the cat keeps playing with the lower branches .
<user1> I know , I know . But it reminds me of the great Christmas we just had . All of us were here - - my parents , your parents , the kids , and the cousins - - the food was good , and everybody got what they wanted .
<user0> Yeah , it was a good Christmas . It won ' t always be this good , but we can ' t make it last longer than it should .
<user1> Ok , fine . We need to take down the tree .
<user0> I ' ll make a deal with you . We ' ll leave it up until Sunday , and then we ' ll take it down after church .
<user1> I'm ask for a pizza , please .
<user0> Then you will be happy to here that today all our pizzas are on sale . Two for one .
<user1> You're right , that is great .
<user0> What size would you like ?
<user1> Medium one will be perfect , thank you
<user0> Which kind do you want ?
<user1> I like seafood on my pizza .
<user0> We have two seafood pizzas . Tuna and crab .
<user1> Tuna sounds good today .
<user0> Would that be for here or take away ?
<user1> That would be to go .
<user0> That'll be in a ten minutes . Please sit over there , and I'll call you over as sooner as it's ready .
<user1> No problem .
<user1> I need some remedies for an upset stomach .

<user1> How long should I continue taking them ?

<user1> Thank you for your advice .
<user1> Yes . I want a window seat definitely , in the smoking section .

<user1> It ' s at ... gate 14 .
<user0> Oh , great ! That ' s at the other end of the terminal !
<user1> OK , so here ' s the plan ; When we land , run to gate 14 !
<user0> I ' m be right behind ya !
<user1> You'll need to make an appointment .
<user0> Could I do that right now , please ?
<user1> What day would you like us to do the installation ?
<user0> Is Friday good ?
<user1> We're only available at 3
<user0> You can't come any earlier than that ?
<user1> I'm sorry . That's the only available time .
<user0> Are you available this Saturday ?
<user1> Yes . Anytime on Saturday will be fine .
<user0> How does 11
<user1> We can do it . See you then .
<user1> Yes , it is .
<user0> It looks like it may rain soon .
<user1> Yes , and I hope that it does .
<user0> Why is that ?
<user1> I really love how rain clears the air .
<user0> Me too . It always smells so fresh after it rains .
<user1> Yes , but I love the night air after it rains .
<user0> Really ? Why is that ?
<user1> Because you can see the stars perfectly .
<user0> I really hope it rains today .
<user1> Yeah , me too .
<user1> Sorry , all the tables for three are reserved .
<user0> Do you have a table for four , please ?
<user1> Yes , smoking or non-smoking ?
<user0> We'd like a non-smoking table , please .
<user1> Come with me , please .
<user1> Yeah , of course . You can take a taxi .
<user0> How much will that run me ?
<user1> It depends on traffic and distance , but it is reasonable .
<user0> Do the drivers speak English ?
<user1> Some are better than others . But , you shouldn't have a problem .
<user0> Are they safe ?
<user1> For the most part , yes . If you don't feel comfortable with it , then it is best not to take one at night .
<user1> Sure . What time do you want to go ?
<user0> How about at 3:30 ?
<user1> That sounds good . Today we work on Legs and forearm .
<user0> Hey . I just played basketball earlier , so my legs are a little sore . Let's work out on arms and stomach today .
<user1> I'm on a weekly schedule . You're messing everything up .
<user0> C'mon . We're only switching two days . You can do legs on Friday .
<user1> Aright . I'll meet you at the gym at 3:30 then .
<user1> I knew everything would work out for you !
<user0> I got to meet the night Anger today too . We got along right from the start .
<user1> Wonderful ! Do you already have your work schedule ?
<user0> Not yet , I pick it up tomorrow .
<user1> Do you know what you will be doing yet ?
<user0> Yes , I'll be managing the guys on the dock .
<user1> You're so good with people . I think they will like you !
<user1> Hello , yes , I ' d like to open a bank account .
<user0> Certainly , I can can help you with that . What type of account would you like to open ? A chequing or a savings account ?
<user1> What What features do they offer ?
<user0> Well , if you just take a look here , see , with our chequing account , you can have unlimited daily transactions for a small monthly fee , and our savings account has a higher interest rate , but you must carry a minimum balance of $ 10,000 dollars .
<user1> I see , well , I think I ' m more interested in a chequing account . I like to have easy access to my money .
<user0> Alright , then , with this chequing account you ' ll be issued a debit card and a cheque book . Will you require overdraft protection ? There is an extra fee for that .
<user1> No , that won ' t be necessary .
<user0> In that case , I ' ll get you to fill out this paperwork . I ' ll need your social insurance number , and two pieces of government ID . If you could just sign here , and here , and here . we ' ll be all set . Would you like to make a deposit today ?
<user1> Yes , I ' d like to deposit one billion dollars .
<user1> Sure . Do you want to have the car washed ?
<user0> Yes , please . When can you get it done ?
<user1> You can pick it up in half an hour . By the way , how are you going to pay , cash or credit ?
<user0> By credit .
<user1> Yes . I ' m going to travel around Europe .
<user0> Wow , that sounds great ! Where are you going ?
<user1> I think I will start off in Paris . Then I ' m going to take the train to Nice and then go on to Milan .
<user0> Oh that will be lovely . You ' ll be able to do lots of shopping I expect .
<user1> Oh yes and try lots of new food too .
<user0> Great . Make sure you buy me a souvenir !
<user1> Oh , don ' t worry , I will !
<user1> It ' s nice to meet you , too .
<user0> I am happy to be speaking to a presidential candidate .
<user1> Would you like to ask me anything ?
<user0> What do you feel about gay marriage ?
<user1> I think everyone has the right to love who they want .
<user0> Would you legalize gay marriage ?
<user1> Yes , I would .
<user0> Many people won ' t like that .
<user1> I ' m sure they won ' t , but that ' s my view on gay marriage .
<user0> I really like you .
<user1> I really appreciate that .
<user1> This is Mr.White speaking .
<user0> Hi . I understand that you have a house for sale , haven ' t you ?
<user1> Yes .
<user0> I ' d like to know more about it .
<user1> Can you come to my office this afternoon at 3 o ' clock ?
<user0> OK . I will be there .
<user1> Thank you for calling.Goodbye .
<user0> Bye .
<user1> All right . Which room shall I have ?
<user0> Room 202 , but I'm afraid we have to ask for a deposit of $ 200 .
<user1> Mr Green , please .
<user0> Sorry , he's out .
<user1> What time you suspect back them ?
<user0> Sorry , I am not sure , can I take a message ?
<user1> No , thanks . I'll call back later .
<user0> That's fine.please call again later .
<user1> Ok , thank you.Goodbye .
<user1> No , there's a definite difference . You know , the stockholders are the people who own the company ... they're the financial control system . Then there's the CEO — the chief executive officer . He's the hot shot , the main guy who is the boss . If there is only one person with absolute power in the organization , everyone knows that the power will go to their head . It's too dangerous . That's the reason for a Board of Directors . The board is made up of people who are experts in the industry . They could be related to the organization , but more commonly , they are independent and non-biased .
<user0> How many people are on the board of directors ?
<user1> Usually not more than 15 , not less than 10 . They meet monthly , quarterly , or biannually to oversee an organization or company . They provide long term planing and vision , and also act as moral watchdogs rto keep the company in line .
<user1> We would like to start you off at 1,500 yuan a month , not including bonus and overtime pay . We don ' t give bonus every month , but we offer a semi-annual bonus . And you will receive two weeks paid vacation a year , as well . Does it suit you ?
<user0> Yes , thank you . May I ask for an apartment ?
<user1> No problem . We'll supply you with an apartment of two bedrooms and a living room .
<user1> Sorry . You know the rules .
<user0> But I want to watch TV now .
<user1> That ' s out of the question .
<user0> Please .
<user1> Not a chance .
<user0> Not even for an hour ?
<user1> Sorry , it ' s impossible .
<user1> She ' s in the garden , Jane .
<user0> What ' s she doing ?
<user1> She ' s sitting under the tree .
<user0> Is Tim in the garden , too ?
<user1> Yes , he is . He ' s climbing the tree .
<user0> I beg your pardon ? Who ' s climbing the tree .
<user1> Tim is .
<user0> What about the dog ?
<user1> The dog ' s in the garden , too . It ' s running across the grass . It ' s running after a cat .
<user1> I have a sore throat and headache .
<user0> Do you feel tired ?
<user1> Yes , my whole body feels weak . And I really feel terrible .
<user0> I'm sorry to hear that . I'll have to examine you .
<user1> Ok , go ahead .
<user0> Open your mouth and show me your tongue . Say ah ... You have a bad cold . So you must stay in bed for a week .
<user1> What fun ! Normally I ' d love to , but I ' m afraid I have to work late tonight . We ' Ve got to get the contract ready for Miss King .
<user0> Oh , right . You ' re busy with that contract . Maybe you could join us later ?
<user1> Unfortunately , I just can ' t make it this time . I have to go straight home . It ' s my second wedding anniversary , and we ' re supposed to be having a big dinner Susan would kill me if I missed it .
<user0> Happy anniversary ! Sorry you won ' t be there . Maybe some other time ?
<user1> Yeah , maybe . Thanks , anyway . Hope you guys have a great time !
<user1> Not at all . The changing rooms are just this way .
<user0> Thanks . It's a little tight . Do you have any in a larger size ?
<user1> Sure . I'll give you the next size up . That one is small , right ?
<user0> Yes . Also , I'm not so sure about the color .
<user1> Well.It doesn't go with your skirt . I think the color itself is fine though .
<user1> Of course ! Are you ?
<user0> I plan to , but what day is the election ?
<user1> You should know that .
<user0> Can you just tell me ?
<user1> The election is this Tuesday .
<user0> Are you serious ?
<user1> I ' m not kidding .
<user0> It ' s a good thing I asked you .
<user1> That should ' Ve been something you knew already .
<user0> I couldn ' t remember .
<user1> Whatever . Just make sure you go vote .
<user1> Zina , why are you whispering ?
<user0> I've been talking to WebTracker . I'm thinking of jumping ship .
<user1> What ? Are you serious ? You'd defect to our archrival ! ?
<user0> Keep your voice down . We'll talk more later . Right now I need to see Vince .
<user1> We definitely have to talk , Zina . And watch your back . Elvin is still mad about his nose .
<user0> OK , but don't tell anyone what I said .
<user1> I'm not going to buy one .
<user0> You're not ?
<user1> I think it's a waste of money .
<user0> It actually costs less if you have a bus pass .
<user1> How is that ?
<user0> You can use it however many times you need to .
<user1> Is that right ?
<user0> Yup , and you can keep the money in your pocket .
<user1> That sounds nice .
<user0> You should go get yours .
<user1> Yeah , I think I will .
<user1> Yes , good morning . This is Mr . Suzuki from Video TV . May I speak to Mr . Johnson ?
<user0> I'm sorry , but Mr . Johnson is out at the moment . Can I take a message ?
<user1> Uh , yes , okay . Tell him John Suzuki called . That's S-U-Z-U-K-I .
<user0> Yes .
<user1> From Video TV .
<user0> Yes , Video TV .
<user1> Tell him I telephoned . I'd like to see him about the videotapes . Can he call me this afternoon ?
<user0> Yes , Of course . What's your telephone number ?
<user1> It's , area code 413 , 447-9626 .
<user0> That is 413-447-9662 ?
<user1> No , that's 447-9626 .
<user0> Oh , I'm sorry , 447-9626 .
<user1> Yes , that's right . Extension 162 .
<user0> Extension 162 . Okay , Mr . Suzuki . I'll give him the message .
<user1> Thank you . Good-bye .
<user0> Good-bye .
<user1> Sure . I usually have my lunch here . The food is tasty and they offer a big variety .
<user0> Let's line up . The steak is very inviting . I'll have it .
<user1> I'll have ham and egg with French fries . What dessert do you want ?
<user0> Banana pie .
<user1> Where shall we sit ?
<user0> How about there ?
<user1> I love it . I really enjoy creating a meal from various ingredients and watching my friends enjoy it.It gives me a real sense of satisfaction.Do you enjoy cooking ?
<user0> I don ' t like it.It takes up too much time and I really hate having it clean up after the meal . I can ' t stand doing the washing up , drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away .
<user1> You can ask the guests for help . My guests usually insist on doing the washing up . I just have to remind them where everything goes .
<user0> So what kinds of dishes do you usually make ? I know you like Italian food .
<user1> Italian , Indian and chinese . I ' Ve only recently started cooking chinese meals and I need some more practice .
<user0> Do you find it hard to get ingredients for Chinese food ?
<user1> Not at all.You can find most of them in supermarkets.The ingredients are usually the same as in Western food.The way that the food is prepared is the big difference , not the ingredients .
<user0> How long does it take you to cook a meal for 5 or 6 people ?
<user1> Obviously , it depends on what I ' m cooking.But I ' d say it generally takes about one and a half hours .
<user1> You came to the right place . Any particular decade ?
<user0> If you had a box made in the ' 20s , that would be nice .
<user1> We just got one in yesterday , so now we have six .
<user0> Would any of them have dancing figures ?
<user1> Yes , we still have two boxes left that have dancing figures .
<user0> Oh , they're both so beautiful . Let me have this one , I think .
<user1> That one truly is a beautiful piece of work , isn't it ?
<user0> One last question
<user1> Oh , no . Everything we sell here is " as is . "
<user0> I guess I was asking for too much .
<user1> If it breaks down , maybe you can find a repairman on the Internet .
<user1> Why not ? Come on ! Just a cute little puppy . or a kitty !
<user0> Who is going to look after a dog or a cat ?
<user1> I will ! I ' ll feed it , bathe it and walk it every day ! We can get a Labrador or a German Shepard !
<user0> What if we want to take a vacation ? Who will we leave it with ? Plus , our apartment is too small for that breed of dog .
<user1> Ok . How about we get a cat or a ferret ?
<user0> We ' re planning on having children soon , I don ' t think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house .
<user1> Fine ! Let ' s get a bird then ! We can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk ! A parrot would be awesome !
<user0> I ' ll tell you what , I can get you some hamsters and we ' ll take it from there .
<user1> Yay !
<user1> But I haven't used exercising equipment before . Can you tell us some more details ?
<user0> Certainly . We have here the race apparatus , stationary bike , muscle builder set , chest expander , bar bell , dumb bell and so on .
<user1> Working in the gym is a very good way for losing weight . What else do you have ?
<user0> Here's the swimming pool . It's open from 10 a . m . to 11 p . m . There are also massage rooms here .
<user1> That's wonderful ! I like swimming .
<user1> I've already told my buddy , Mark , that I am going hunting with him in Alaska .
<user0> You can't be serious !
<user1> Hey , I've always gone hunting or fishing on vacation . I am sorry that bothers you .
<user0> After a year together , I thought it pretty safe to assume that we would automatically spend our vacation together .
<user1> Says who ? I don't think that is necessarily the case .
<user0> You know , now that I think about it , I really don't have much more to say to you at all !
<user1> Whatever you say !
<user1> Not yet . I don't know how to fill out the form . What is the tax-free allowance for supporting a dependent ?
<user0> I don't really know . Why not ask the accountant or the lawyer of the law firm ? They will tell you which is subject or not subject to taxation . He can even help you avoid paying tax legally .
<user1> If I don't pay my taxes , would the tax officials discover it ?
<user0> Certainly . No one who evades tax can escape from their detection.They ' ll check your income through computers . You'd better make a declaration to the tax authorities as soon as possible . If you fail to meet the deadline , you will be fined .
<user1> I quarreled with my roommate last night . He is really stubborn .
<user0> Calm down ! Shouting won ' t help ?
<user1> He is really outrageous .
<user0> What happened ?
<user1> I went back home last night . You know tired as a dog , so I took a quick shower and went to bed . I couldn't fall asleep , because Brian was there in the living room , playing his stupid stereo so loud . I kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . He shouted at me .
<user0> What ? He can't do this to you .
<user1> Well , he did it anyway . Then he came into my room and shot all his shit blah blah blah ... you know .
<user0> What did you do ?
<user1> I shouted it back of course .
<user0> Hold it , Mike . You won't accomplish anything by hollering at him , right ? You worked it all up till now . Why not wait until you cool down a bit ?
<user1> What would you do if you were in my shoes ?
<user0> Just stay cool . You know . When you get back home tonight , tell him that you didn't mean to quarrel with him .
<user1> No way , Kate . I mean it's just not my fault .
<user0> I know . It wouldn't hurt much to say sorry first . And after that , you can casually mention the problem . I am sure he will cooperate .
<user1> I am too angry to do that .
<user1> Let me see . I am sorry we just have sold it out .
<user0> Will you have it later ?
<user1> I think so . Could I have you name , telephone number ? If we get one , I will call you .
<user0> That's terrific . Thank you .
<user1> Charles Dickens.Actually no one can parallel him in writing .
<user0> I'm afraid I can't agree with you on that . I like D.H.Laurence ' s novels better .
<user1> I like board games . I like chinese chess and draughts .
<user0> I ' Ve never played Chinese chess before , but I ' Ve seen old men playing it in the street . It looks complicated .
<user1> It ' s about as complicated as chess . The basic rule and moves are simple enough , but there are many strategies that players need to learn .
<user0> I like playing cards . I ' m pretty good at poker . Do you play cards ?
<user1> I ' m terrible at cards and so I never play games which involve gambling , like poker . If I did , I ' d lose all my money .
<user0> Do you play bridge ?
<user1> Yes , I do . It ' s hard to find four players though , so I don ' t play very often . Do you know anyone who plays ? If so , we could set up a game .
<user0> I can play quite well . I have a friend who likes playing , but she ' s not very good at it . Shall I invite her to play ?
<user1> Sure , I have a friend who play fairly well . We should find out when our friends are free and arrange a game .
<user0> I ' ll call my friend now . you call yours .
<user1> Sure . The coach leaves at 6:30 a . m . , in front of our office . The drive takes eight hours , with two stops to see some sights .
<user0> What about the hotel accommodations ?
<user1> You'll be staying at Holiday Inn . It's a three-star hotel with two restaurants and a swimming pool .
<user0> Great . What types of things will we do at Lushun Falls ?
<user1> The second day you take a four-hour city tour . In the afternoon you go on the famous boat cruise under the falls .
<user1> Oh hello , Sally . This is Dave Thomson here . Could I speak to Jim please ?
<user0> I'm afraid he's not in at the moment Dave . He went out about an hour ago and he's not back yet .
<user1> Any idea when he might be back ?
<user0> Well , he shouldn't be long . He said he was just going to get some paint . But I wouldn't be surprised if he's stopped off at the pub on the way back .
<user1> OK . well , tell him I've called , will you , and I'll try again later .
<user0> All right . Goodbye , Dave .
<user1> Thanks then Sally . Goodbye .
<user1> I ' m in the middle of something right now . I ' ll be there in a second .
<user0> This can ' t wait ! I need your help now !
<user1> Alright , alright . I ' m coming .
<user0> Ok , here ' s a list of chores we need to get done . I'll do the dishes and get all the groceries for tonight . You can sweep and mop the floors . Oh , and the furniture needs to be dusted .
<user1> You know what , I have to pick something up at the mall , so why don ' t you clean the floors and I'll go to the supermarket and get all the groceries .
<user0> Sure that ' s fine . Here is the list of all the things you need to get . Don't forget anything ! And can you pick up a bottle of wine on your way home ?
<user1> Hey , honey I ' m back . Wow , the house looks really good !
<user0> Great ! Can you set the table ?
<user1> Just a sec I ' m just gonna vacuum this rug real fast
<user0> Wait ! Don ' t turn it on ...
<user1> I'd like to talk to somebody about the Group Account Deposit Service .
<user0> This refers to the deposit business offered to the level 1 account of group companies .
<user1> What is it used for ? I mean , why bother to get this special account ?
<user0> Group companies can use this to make their arrangement of funds flexible , when dealing with their subsidiaries .
<user1> I see , so this can really cut down on time and centralise management . Interesting ...
<user1> Yes , sir . What can I do for you ?
<user0> I want to buy some specialties . Can you recommend me some ?
<user1> Sure . I strongly advise you to buy a bottle of perfume and a lighter .
<user0> Fine . They look nice . I will take both of them .
<user1> May I have a look at your passport , please ?
<user1> Good morning . I'm interested in antiques . Do you have any ?
<user0> Yes , we have a great variety of Chinese antiques .
<user1> What do you have ?
<user0> Well , we have some painting and some porcelain . Which do you like better ?
<user1> I'd like porcelain .
<user0> Good . How about the table set ?
<user1> Oh , it looks well . I like it very much .
<user0> It's made in Jingdezhen .
<user1> How much is it ?
<user0> One thousand eight hundred yuan .
<user1> It's not expensive . I'll take it .
<user1> Not hot but warm . Very comfortable .
<user0> Are you staying at the Hilton ?
<user1> Yes , I have already booked a room .
<user1> We've got several good chicken dishes if you like chicken .
<user0> We'll try one of your specials this time .
<user1> This is worth trying .
<user1> Thank you . So pleasant to meet you here !
<user0> I heard that you are interested in our silk skirts and new style of coats .
<user1> Yes , I've brought a list of your recent products with me . We'd like to import some of your latest clothes for the second half of this year . We're ready to place an order with you .
<user0> Great ! B , most of the items listed are available this year . I hope we can come to an agreement and sign the contracts , so as to enable our timely delivery .
<user1> That sounds good . But I have a proposal now .
<user0> What's the proposal ?
<user1> Both of our two parties were involved in the discussion previously . Shall we also allow some of our clients to join us ?
<user0> Good idea ! In this way , our clients ' needs will be met and disagreements between the two parties avoided .
<user1> Sounds like we have the same idea .
<user1> Generally speaking , job seekers can enter the websites either of job agencies or of some units for job advertisements .
<user0> How should I contact them ?
<user1> You can e-mail your application materials for application to the websites of job agencies for enrollment in their database .
<user0> Can I get a quick reply from the sites ?
<user1> Yes , usually it takes a short time , but you have to await the choice of the units for a while .
<user1> Cross the street and walk two blocks west.You can't miss it .
<user0> Thanks .
<user1> Sure . What kind of skin do you have ?
<user0> My skin is oily .
<user1> Then I advise you to buy the LAY cleansing milk .
<user0> Can you tell me more ?
<user1> Who ?
<user0> Sue John .
<user1> You must have the wrong number .
<user0> Oh , I'm sorry .
<user1> You can place the smaller one in the overhead bin and put the bigger one under the seat in front of you .
<user0> Thank you very much .
<user1> Please make sure to fasten your seat belt . We are to take off .
<user1> I love this store . The only problem is that it ' s extremely expensive .
<user0> Don ' t worry . I ' Ve decided that for your birthday I ' m going to take you shopping for a new dress .
<user1> Really ? I thought you hated shopping ?
<user0> I do , that ' s why you should appreciate this gift !
<user1> Sure . That ' s really nice of you . Let ' s go in and try some things on .
<user0> How about this red dress ? I think it would really suit you .
<user1> That ' s gorgeous ! Do they have it in a size 8 ?
<user0> Here you go.On any other day , it would cost me a fortune , but it ' s on special offer today .
<user1> I think this color isn ' t quite right for me . Do they have the same dress in white ?
<user0> Let me look . Let ' s see ... they ' Ve got one in blue , green , pink , black ... and white . Here you are .
<user1> This is perfect ! What do you think ?
<user0> I think you look fantastic . Happy Birthday !
<user1> I ' m so lucky . You only get a chance like this once in a blue moon ! Thanks honey !
<user1> I've been trying to get through to the booking office for the last ten minutes . But the line has been engaged all the time . Why is it taking so long ?
<user0> I'm sorry to hear that . I'm afraid it is often the case during the peak hours . Shall I ask them to call you when the line is free ?
<user1> OK . Please do so if it is not troublesome .
<user0> No trouble at all . May I know your name and room number ?
<user1> I'm Du Juan , in Room 312 .
<user0> I see . Wait in the room , please .
<user1> Thank you for your kindness .
<user1> I couldn't agree more !
<user0> Anything else you want to add ?
<user1> Oh , yeah , two beers .
<user1> Sure , here they are .
<user0> Any luggage ?
<user1> Just this suitcase .
<user0> Your backpack is very big and today's flight is quite full . I am afraid that you will have to check your backpack too .
<user1> No problem . What about this carry-on ?
<user0> You can take that with you .
<user1> Can I have an aisle seat , PLS .
<user0> No problem . I'll give you an aisle seat in the center row . And here is your ticket , passport and boarding pass . Please board the plane at Gate 15 .
<user1> Thank you . And when is the latest time for me to board the plane ?
<user0> 15mins before the plane takes off . The plane is scheduled to leave on time .
<user1> Thank you very much !
<user0> You are welcome ! Have a nice flight .
<user1> I have worked as an executive secretary for 5 years , first for trading companies , and now I am working for a trust company . I interact well with peers , clients , administrators and bosses . I thrive on challenge and work well in high-stress environments .
<user0> How are your typing and shorthand skills ?
<user1> I can type 100 Chinese words a minute and take dictation in English at 150 words a minute .
<user0> Can you operate computers skillfully ?
<user1> Yes , I can . I have received some special training in computers . Besides I am good at operating common office machines , such as fax machines and duplicating machines .
<user0> Sometimes we are very busy and need to work overtime . How do you feel about that ?
<user1> That's all right . But could you tell me how often and how many hours I should work overtime ?
<user0> It just depends . If we have important visiting delegations , you have to stay with us . It's not unusual .
<user1> Mr . Smith , I's like to ask you a question .
<user0> OK , please .
<user1> What specific duties would I perform if I am hired ?
<user0> Nothing different from a secretary's common responsibilities . However , you know , our company is an international trade-oriented company , can you handle English papers and write English correspondence ?
<user1> Yes . I specialized in English secretary studies at college and that's one of the main parts of my present job .
<user0> What are your salary expectations ?
<user1> I really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary . Maybe you could tell me what is budgeted for the position .
<user0> The starting monthly salary would be ¥ 2,000 , with rises after the half year according to your competence .
<user1> I think it's acceptable and I really like the job . And when can I know the decision ?
<user0> We'll inform you of our final decision by early July . Do you have any other questions ?
<user1> No . Thank you for the time .
<user1> We have to equip our company with a network of work stations at every office and show room as soon as possible .
<user0> I also realized this issue . And office automation is essential .
<user1> Besides , Internet tends to be more essential now in the information age .
<user0> Good idea . A network of work stations is helpful for our management .
<user1> And , to be frank , our copying machines are too slow ; our telephone system is limited in function .
<user0> You are right . The current equipment of our offices really falls behind . Next week , you can provide me a catalogue of new equipment .
<user1> I need to book a plane ticket to London .
<user0> Round-trip or one-way ?
<user1> One-way .
<user0> What date would you like to fly ?
<user1> Saturday , July 25 .
<user0> How many people will be traveling ?
<user1> Just one adult .
<user0> Which class ?
<user1> Economy , please . Economy class is the cheapest , right ?
<user0> Right . Ok , the fare is $ 700 .
<user1> I would like for you to come in and talk about a few more tests that I would like to run .
<user0> Does this mean that you have bad news for me ?
<user1> I just want to talk to you about the tests that I want to run .
<user0> Can ' t you just tell me now ?
<user1> I don ' t know anything for certain . We always do a double check if there is a question .
<user0> I want to see you right away .
<user1> You can come in this afternoon . If you are feeling too stressed , feel free to bring a friend along .
<user0> I know for sure that something is wrong !
<user1> Don ' t worry about a thing ; we are just taking a second look and talking .
<user1> Yes , I am sure I can .
<user0> Do you think you are proficient in both written and spoken English ?
<user1> Yes , I think I am quite proficient in both written and spoken English .
<user0> Do you think you can make yourself understood in English with ease ?
<user1> Yes , I think I can in ordinary circumstances .
<user0> Do you think you can speak English quite fluently ? Tell me about your English education .
<user1> Yes , I think I speak English quite fluently . I got a high score on TOEFL . I majored in English in college .
<user1> Thank you for noticing ! I've been making a few lifestyle changes over the past year .
<user0> Tell me about it . I'm interested .
<user1> Well , it all started when my brother challenged me to quit smoking .
<user0> Ha ! That's right . You used to smoke . I forgot !
<user1> When I kicked that habit , I found I had so much more energy . I started exercising .
<user0> At the gym ?
<user1> No . I like to be outside . I took up hiking and mountain biking .
<user1> Thank you . I ' m pleased to meet you , Mr . Brown . My name is Kathy Pewless , the representative of Green Textile Import and Export Corporation .
<user0> Pleased to meet you too , Ms . Pewless . I travel a lot every year on business , but this is my first visit to your country . I must say I have been much impressed by your friendly people .
<user1> Thank you for saying so . Have you seen the exhibition halls ? On display are most of our products , such as silk , woolen knitwear , cotton piece goods , and garments .
<user0> Oh , yes . I had a look yesterday . I found some of the exhibits to be fine in quality and beautiful in design . The exhibition has successfully displayed to me what your corporation handles . I ' Ve gone over the catalogue and the pamphlets enclosed in your last letter . I ' Ve got some idea of your exports . I ' m interested in your silk blouses .
<user1> Our silk is known for its good quality . It is one of our trade - trional exports . Silk blouses are brightly colored and beau - fully designed . They ' Ve met with great favor overseas and are always in great demand .
<user1> Sure . What do you need the most help with , the food or entertainment ?
<user0> I need help with food .
<user1> OK , well , let's coordinate our efforts . Should this party be formal or casual ?
<user0> I think it should be casual .
<user1> I agree . Next , we have to decide on food . We have a choice of Chinese or Continental Cuisine . Which one should we have ?
<user0> I would prefer Chinese food for this party .
<user1> Perfect choice . For music , should we have a live band or a DJ ?
<user0> I think we should hire a live band .
<user1> OK then . Well , I will work on my part and get back to you with my progress on Friday .
<user1> No problem . Now , do you prefer working with others or flying solo ?
<user0> Actually , I enjoy both .
<user1> So , what is most important to you in a job ? Do you need job security or professional growth and a chance to advance ?
<user0> I need job security .
<user1> Would you be able to relocate ?
<user0> I am open to relocating .
<user1> What are your annual salary requirements ?
<user0> I need at least 75,000 per year .
<user1> I ' ll keep that in mind . Thank you for coming in today . We ' ll be in touch .
<user1> Yes , it is . Please put your luggage on this scale .
<user0> OK . Is the plane on schedule ?
<user1> Yes , it is . How many pieces of hand luggage do you have ?
<user0> Two .
<user1> Yes . Come with me to the vitamin section .
<user0> I knew there would be a few choices , but this selection is huge !
<user1> You're looking for a multi though , right ?
<user0> That's right . Just a simple multi-vitamin that I can take every day .
<user1> Okay . Then I recommend this one . It's made especially for men about your age .
<user0> Oh ! You took the guesswork right out of that one .
<user1> That's my job ! Is there anything else I can assist you with ?
<user1> Okay . Is your hair naturally curly or is it a perm ?
<user0> It's natural . My friend told me you know how to work with curls .
<user1> That's my specialty . Let me put this around your neck .
<user0> Do you have any product that controls frizz ?
<user1> With the cut I'll give you , we will minimize a lot of that .
<user0> Thank you !
<user1> And when we're done , I'll show you some great stuff to take care of the rest .
<user1> Okay . Say when .
<user1> I'm not in the mood .
<user0> It's the circus .
<user1> I don't want to sit there and watch them torturing the animals .
<user0> Oh , come on , they give them treat too.Oh , look , that little monkey is so cute .
<user1> Cute ? Hope so .
<user0> Oh , it is coming to us , come on , Ben , get a banana to it .
<user1> Me ? No way , keep him away from me , please .
<user0> Why are you acting so strange today ?
<user1> I've said that I've got a problem with the circus . I'm not kidding .
<user0> That's weird !
<user1> All right , madam . When I was sales manager at the Beijing Friendship Store . I succeeded in raising the yearly sales volume by 25 % and profit margins from 50 % to 80 % .
<user0> That is quite an achievement ! Do you consider it your most rewarding work experience ?
<user1> I don't think so . I'll create further achievement in the future .
<user0> Have you received any honors ?
<user1> Yes . I got the title of " Advance Worker " in 2006 .
<user0> Do you have any publications ?
<user1> Yes . I wrote a thesis entitled " On Interpersonal Relations in the Socialist Market Economy " and it was published in China Daily .
<user1> Hi there , everyone . We hope you're having a good night !
<user0> Wasn't that football game great ! I just knew we'd win !
<user1> The night is young , folks . Get some food and mingle with those faces from yesterday .
<user0> Later we'll let you know who the King and Queen of the Reunion will be .
<user1> But for now , the band is playing the songs from our senior year . Get out on that dance floor !
<user1> Yes . Go to the next corner and turn left onto Center Street . Walk three blocks to Second Avenue and turn right . Walk two more blocks and you'll see City Hall on the left .
<user0> I'm sorry . I didn't follow you . Could you please repeat that ?
<user1> Okay . First , go to the next corner and turn left onto Center Street .
<user0> Uh-huh .
<user1> Then , walk three blocks to Second Avenue an turn right . Are you with me so far ?
<user0> Yes . I'm following you .
<user1> Then , walk two more blocks an you ' ll see City Hall on the left . Have you got all that ?
<user0> Yes . Now I've got it . Thank you very much .
<user1> Nothing much , what's going on ?
<user0> I'm having a party this Friday .
<user1> Oh , really ? That's nice .
<user0> I wanted to see if you wanted to come .
<user1> This Friday ? Sorry , I already have plans .
<user0> Doing what ?
<user1> I'm going to dinner with my family .
<user0> I really wanted you to come , but I understand .
<user1> Yeah , maybe next time .
<user0> I'll hold you to that .
<user1> Sounds like a plan .
<user1> It's simple . You can use call transfer .
<user0> Is it so simple ?
<user1> Sure . You know , we spend most of our time at home or in the office every day , so I receive handset calls with the hand-free telephone , so I need pay little for receiving calls .
<user0> It's true .
<user1> Call transfer has many other advantages . When I am in places where network can't cover , such as the high building , I also use call transfer function , which transfers my calls to the hand-free telephone and I will not miss any call .
<user0> That's all ?
<user1> In hospitals or on planes , handsets will interfere with some equip-ment , so we must close our handsets . If you set call transfer , the problem will be solved .
<user1> Tomorrow morning ? What about tomorrow afternoon ?
<user0> Then I'll see you in the afternoon .
<user1> OK .
<user1> Welcome . One of your duties is to know the number of the customer and accept reservation .
<user0> What else do I need to do ?
<user1> You inform the people in charge and let them reserve dinning tables for guests .
<user1> You still have time on your lease .
<user0> There ' s no way that I can stay here .
<user1> That ' s not going to be all right .
<user0> I don ' t understand why .
<user1> I ' m going to have to keep your deposit
<user0> Why can ' t I have it back ?
<user1> Because you ' re leaving before your lease is over .
<user0> You have to give it back to me .
<user1> You ' re not going to get it .
<user0> But I ' m not able to live here anymore .
<user1> I can ' t help you with that .
<user1> Here it is . 350 Yuan all together .
<user0> May son adores my new hairstyle so I suppose it is worth it .
<user1> Hearing you say that is a big reward for us . And here is the receipt .
<user0> Thank you .
<user1> Wait ! Congratulations ! You are the lucky customer of our anniversary celebration .
<user0> Wow , it's surprising . So what do I get ?
<user1> You can have a free facial and then make up free for you . Do you want it now ?
<user0> Probably not . Doing that will probably take another three hours which I can't afford now .
<user1> Here is our number . Call us when you are ready to come .
<user0> You mean I should make an appointment ahead of time ?
<user1> Yes .
<user0> Got it . Bye for now .
<user1> I am sorry , but I can't lend it to you now , for I haven't finished reading it . If you don't mind , I can lend you some back numbers to you .
<user0> That would be very kind of you . By the way , is it a monthly magazine ?
<user1> No , it is a fortnightly . So , you see , I can get the new one quite soon .
<user1> Yes , I do . I also use an anti-spyware program and a firewall . There are so many nasties on the internet and so many people who are trying to use the internet to hurt other users . You have to be very c
<user0> How often do you run your anti-virus program ?
<user1> I usually run it every few days . It finds a virus about half the time .
<user0> Which anti-virus program would you recommend ?
<user1> Have you tried this one ? It ' s very good and you can download it for free on the internet . You can also download updates for free .
<user0> That sounds very good . Which website should I visit to download it ?
<user1> Just a minute ... go to this one . I ' ll send you an email with the line in it . It only takes a few minutes to download . Then you have to go through the set up procedures . But they are not complicated .
<user0> What do you use your computer for ?
<user1> I use it for several things-surfing the net , word processing and creating presentations . I don ' t play many games on my computer , but I do a lot of work with photographs . Using a computer program , you
<user0> Computers are great , aren ' t they ? I should download some programs and learn how to use them .
<user1> B :: Nice to meet you , Mr . Wilson .
<user0> A :: Tim , please . Please be seated .
<user1> B :: Thank you .
<user0> A :: So , Wily , you have been with IBM for two years , ready for change ?
<user1> B :: Well , I think I'm ready for new challenges .
<user1> What is your address ?
<user0> I stay at No . 115 Fucking Road .
<user1> OK , a taxi will be there by 9:30 .
<user0> What are your rates ?
<user1> It is RIB 10 yuan initially and 2 yuan for each kilometer .
<user0> I have a lot of luggage . Will those fit in the taxi ?
<user1> Take it easy . I'll send a larger to pick you up .
<user0> Thank you very much .
<user1> Hello , Becky . Well , you see , I have this thing here , called a Fixed Deposit Certificate , and I've just noticed the date on it .
<user0> Oh , I see . You have two choices here you can either redeem or renew .
<user1> I think I'll redeem , if that's not a problem .
<user0> No problem at all , Mr Waterstone . Any preference as to how you want the money ?
<user1> Anything you like , but not too many large notes . It's useful to have smaller notes .
<user0> Here we go , Mr Waterstone . Here's your money and your interest note .
<user1> Yes , yes . Everything's fine . Thank you very much , Becky .
<user1> I need to rent three pairs of skates for the morning .
<user0> What sizes do you need ?
<user1> One pair of 37 , and two pairs of 21 . One for me , and the other two for two kids .
<user0> Here you are . And here are three crash helmets .
<user1> Thanks . Well , those two kids are beginners . What should I do about their safety ?
<user0> Well , there are a lot to do , but nothing to worry about . First , make sure they don't go far from the railings .
<user1> Oh , yeah , maybe I should ask them just to walk along the railings .
<user0> That's a good idea . And remind them to be slow at the beginning , not to run into the railings .
<user1> OK . Anything else ?
<user0> Never go to the center of the lake . The ice there is too thin to skate on .
<user1> Got it . Thanks for reminding me . And , are there any intensive training courses ?
<user1> Mike , you're late again .
<user0> I'm sorry , but my sister was ill , so I
<user1> Do you think I believe the story like that ?
<user0> But it's true .
<user1> How can believe it if the same excuse was used twice within a week ?
<user0> That's coincident 。
<user1> Ok , hold it . Remember to be punctual next time 。
<user0> I promise I will .
<user1> You'd better .
<user1> Something important ?
<user0> Yes . I have just booked two tickets .
<user1> Tickets ? What tickets ?
<user0> Two air tickets .
<user1> Air tickets ?
<user0> Yes . We will fly to Paris the day after tomorrow .
<user1> We ? The day after tomorrow ? What are you talking about ?
<user0> Today is June 18 , isn ' t it ?
<user1> Yes . So ?
<user0> Think about it !
<user1> Then it is June 20 the day after tomorrow .
<user0> Yes . Think about it carefully .
<user1> Oh , come on . Tell me please . Why did you book tickets to Paris ?
<user0> Oh , honey ! Don ' t you remember this important day to us ?
<user1> Sorry .
<user0> It is our 10th wedding anniversary this June 20 .
<user1> Our 10th wedding anniversary ?
<user0> Of course . You completely forgot it .
<user1> Darling . I think you have made a mistake .
<user0> I have made a mistake ?
<user1> Yes . We married on July 20 ten years ago .
<user0> July 20 ? But I think it should be June 20 .
<user1> Yes . We had planned to marry on June 20 , but something happened , so we had to put off our wedding day .
<user0> Yes . I remember now . We put it off . I did make a mistake . But how shall we deal with the tickets ?
<user1> Since you have booked . Then let ' s celebrate our wedding anniversary before hand .
<user1> No , thank you . Check , please .
<user0> Wait a moment . I will calculate it for you . Your bill comes to $ 36 .
<user1> Here are $ 40 . Keep the change . That's my tip for you .
<user1> How to do it ?
<user0> Just pick up a tray , then put a knife , a fork , a spoon and a paper napkin on it and stand in the line .
<user1> How long will it take to reach the buffet ?
<user0> Not long , because people rush for lunch .
<user1> The line sure does move fast .
<user0> Tell the man behind the counter what you want .
<user1> OK . I like that green vegetable but I don't know how to call it .
<user0> Just point to it if you don't know the name .
<user1> All right .
<user1> Yeah , but I'm still waiting for my invitation .
<user0> Oh really ? She gave me mine earlier today .
<user1> Well , she'll probably just give me my invitation later on today .
<user0> Yeah , so are you planning on going ?
<user1> I think so . It sounds like it's going to be a lot of fun .
<user0> It really does , I can't wait .
<user1> What time does the party start ?
<user0> It starts at 8 o'clock .
<user1> Oh , well , how many people has she given invites to so far ?
<user0> I'm not sure , but I don't think she's given out that many .
<user1> Well , hopefully she'll give me my invite later on today .
<user1> The outlook in the future is very positive . Because we have been in this field for hundreds of years and we know how to survive this crisis safely .
<user0> As the department I am applying for is expanding , I would like to contribute by effort .
<user1> Great . Welcome to our company .
<user1> Can you please tell me where you are located ?
<user0> Sure , we are off Singing Road , close to the bank .
<user1> Thank you , I know where that is .
<user1> Hello , John .
<user0> I'm with Hartford public relations . I'd like to set up an appointment to come by and talk with you about our services .
<user1> How about tomorrow at 11 o'clock ?
<user1> Oh , don't mention it . It was terrible .
<user0> What ' the matter ?
<user1> The food station was as crowded as usual . I waited for 20 minutes for my sandwich , and when I finally got it the chicken was underdone .
<user0> I see . You simply can't blame the server for this .
<user1> Yes , I know . Fast food is so popular in this district .
<user0> That's true .
<user1> Anyway , how was your such , Catherine ?
<user0> It was good . I brought lunch from home today .
<user1> You did ? I thought you must feel right at home here as we get as many fast food restaurants as you do in America .
<user0> Well , I personally don't like them because I don't believe that they are healthy .
<user1> I guess you're right . More often than not , people go there only for convenience . The foods may taste good , but generally speaking , they are high in calories , salt and fat .
<user0> Yes . I am wondering that you must believe fast food is our lifestyle , don't you ?
<user1> You bet . Almost all top brands such as McDonald's and KFC are from America .
<user0> Well , actually two-thirds of Americans may avoid these places .
<user1> Seriously ?
<user0> Yeah , it's hard to believe but true .
<user1> Wow , that's really interesting . So who won ?
<user0> Well , the Great Wall of China , the Taj Mahal in India .
<user1> I've been there ! It really is an amazing work of architecture and art . The entire complex is made of white marble and in the interior of the tomb , the walls are covered with gems and emeralds !
<user0> Cool ! Also amongst the winners is Petra , in Jordan , Mach Pitch in Peru and the pyramid in Chichenitza in Mexico .
<user1> Wait a minute ! It also says that the Christ Re-deemer statue in Brazil and the Colosseum in Rome are wonders . I would love to go to Italy and see the Colosseum , stand in the middle like a gladiator !
<user0> Well , let's see if we can find some cheap airfare and we can go towards the end of the year .
<user1> Good idea !
<user1> That should be no problem . May I have your full name , please ?
<user0> My name is John Sandals .
<user1> Hello , Mr . Sandals . My name is Michelle . What days do you need that reservation , sir ?
<user0> I'm planning to visit New York from Friday , April 14 until Monday , April 17 .
<user1> Our room rates recently went up . Is that okay with you , Mr . Sandals ?
<user0> How much per night are we talking about ?
<user1> Each night will be $ 308 .
<user0> That price is perfectly acceptable .
<user1> Wonderful ! Do you prefer a smoking or nonsmoking room ?
<user0> Nonsmoking , please .
<user1> Next question , Is a queen-size bed okay ?
<user0> That sounds fine .
<user1> Okay , Mr . Sandals . Your reservation is in our computer . All we need now is a phone number .
<user0> Certainly . My phone number is 626-555-1739 .
<user1> Thank you , Mr . Sandals . We look forward to seeing you in New York !
<user1> Um yes . I'd like a medium pizza with pepperoni , olives , and extra cheese .
<user0> We have a two-for-one special on large pizzas.Would you like a large pizza instead ?
<user1> Sure , that sounds good .
<user0> Great ! Would you like your second pizza to be the same as the first ?
<user1> No , make the second one with ham , pineapple and green peppers . Oh , and make it thin crust .
<user0> Okay , thin crust . Your total is $ 21.50 and yourorder will arrive in thirty minutes or it ' s free !
<user1> Perfect . Thank you . Bye ..
<user0> wait ! ! I need your address !
<user1> Hi there . I'm calling about Personal Internet Banking , what details can you give me ?
<user0> Personal Internet Banking is a self service financial service that is based on the Internet . It can be used by both businesses and individuals . We offer an online payment service , Personal Net Banking , which includes services such as account transfers , personal foreign exchange trading . You can also get account management services , online bill payment , for household bills like gas and electricity ...
<user1> That sounds good . At the moment I spend ages queuing at the post office to pay my bills .
<user1> It depends on the time of year . At peak times we hire in casual workers to help with packing and dispatch . We also contract out certain services all year round , for example , cleaning . We run a very tight operation !
<user0> Do you handle the recruiting yourselves ?
<user1> Sometimes we use a local employment agency . It depends on the job .
<user1> Well I think I can afford that apartment . But are pets allowed ?
<user0> Hmm ... let me look . Yes , it says it's a pet-friendly building .
<user1> That's great . That means I can bring my cat , Mr . Twinkles . Where is the apartment located ?
<user0> It says it's located in the suburbs .
<user1> Chicken , please .
<user0> Good choice !
<user1> What kind of drinks do you have ?
<user0> Well , we have all kinds of beverages in addition to fruit juices .
<user1> In that case , let me have a glass of orange juice .
<user0> Anything else ?
<user1> I would like to have some tea as well .
<user0> Another flight attendant is coming down the aisle with coffee and tea .
<user1> I see .
<user1> I'd be glad to .
<user0> I'm afraid that I don't have a credit history . I just came to this country .
<user1> Do you have an account with this bank ?
<user0> I'm afraid not .
<user1> In that case I highly recommend you apply for a savings and checking account also . That would help with your credit card application .
<user0> What is the interest rate on your card ?
<user1> The annual charge rate is 9.5 % .
<user0> That's very expensive !
<user1> Not really . The credit card is a revolving account . You only pay interest on what you owe .
<user0> How does the bank bill its customers for credit card charges ?
<user1> You will receive a monthly statement with each expenditure itemized .
<user0> Does the card provide any other benefits ?
<user1> You can also get a cash advance up to 1,000 dollars on this card .
<user1> Well , I almost always get up very early , and I lift weights for an hour .
<user0> You're kidding !
<user1> No . And then I often go Rollerblading .
<user0> Wow ! How often do you exercise like that ?
<user1> About five times a week . What about you ?
<user0> Oh , I hardly ever exercise . I usually just watch TV in my free time . I guess I'm a real couch potato !
<user1> No , I don't think we have .
<user0> My name is Gao Run .
<user1> How do you do ? My name is James Green .
<user0> Here's my name card .
<user1> And here's mine .
<user0> It's nice to finally meet you .
<user1> And I'm glad to meet you , too .
<user1> Mr . Smith , please .
<user0> Sorry , he is out .
<user1> What time do you expect him back then ?
<user0> Sorry , I am not sure . Can I take a message ?
<user1> No , thanks . I will call back later .
<user0> That ' s fine . Please call again later .
<user1> OK . Thank you . Goodbye .
<user1> Yes , I need some traveler's checks .
<user0> How much do you need ?
<user1> Three thousand US dollars .
<user0> All right , can I have your passbook ?
<user1> Yes , here you go .
<user0> What amounts do you want the checks in ?
<user1> It's all the same to me .
<user0> Here you are .
<user1> Thanks .
<user1> I need you to tell me what the problem is .
<user0> The bathroom sink is stopped up .
<user1> Is the kitchen plumbing messed up also , or just the bathroom plumbing ?
<user0> Just the bathroom plumbing seems to have a problem .
<user1> Did this just start happening , or has it been going on for a while ?
<user0> Everything worked beautifully until a few hours ago .
<user1> Are you going to be home so I can come by and take a look at the problem ?
<user0> I am not sure if I will be home later .
<user1> I will be coming by around 10 this morning . If you aren ' t there , I ' ll just use my key .
<user1> It's more violent than TV news !
<user0> What time is it anyway ?
<user1> Nine-thirty .
<user0> Oh , my God , three hours already ! I have to get the chores done !
<user1> No time . That's their headlights in the window !
<user0> OK , emergency measures . Let's throw the dishes in the trash ! Two birds with one stone ...
<user1> Little dude , your life is over !
<user0> No time to worry . We have to dispose of this evidence .
<user1> He's 21 . How old is James ?
<user0> He's a year older than Keith , but he looks younger .
<user1> How's your father ?
<user0> He's fine . He retired last week . It's a turning point in his life . Now he can relax and enjoy his retirement .
<user1> He can spend more time with his grandchildren .
<user0> Oh , I don't think he wants to . He wants to travel to several different countries around the world .
<user1> So , he wants to have a more active retirement . Good idea !
<user0> How do you want to spend your old age ?
<user1> In the same way , probably .
<user1> Sure , let me take a look ... Personal Information , Education , Experience , Training ... I think you should add another section for language . You speak three languages , so you might as well put that on your resume .
<user0> But languages don't have anything to do with engineering . Shouldn't everything I put on my resume have something to do with my field ?
<user1> Not necessarily . I think people would be impressed by your language abilities . It says something about your level of intellect and experience . Also , I think human resources directors want to see more of a well-rounded person in a resume .
<user0> It's just a piece of paper , you think that they can tell if I am a well-rounded person by looking at it ?
<user1> Well , you're right , the resume is limited in how much it can tell someone about a person . That's why job interviews are important to let people know the real you that they can't see from a piece of paper . But resumes can be helpful in explaining things and giving a good impression to a potential employer .
<user1> I need to think it over .
<user0> Tell me what you need .
<user1> All right . I'm prepared to , if the pay is reasonable .
<user1> What a beautiful view we have here .
<user0> Yes , you can have a bird's-eye view of the whole city .
<user1> Wonderful . Will we have any free time there ?
<user0> Of course . We will stay there for half an hour and you can do your own business .
<user1> I just stayed at home and watched TV .
<user0> did you watch the Barcelona versus Madrid game ?
<user1> yes , it was a very evenly matched game .
<user0> what were the results of the game ?
<user1> it ended in a tie .
<user0> what was the actual score ?
<user1> it was three all .
<user0> really ? I thought Barcelona was going to win . They are a much better team than Madrid .
<user1> if Barcelona had played as they normally do , they should have won .
<user0> what happened ?
<user1> their goalkeepers got injured after the first goal , but he kept on playing anyway .
<user0> that explains it .
<user1> how many more games are left this season ?
<user0> that was the last game before the playoffs .
<user1> when do the playoffs start ?
<user0> in a few weeks . Are you planning on watching them ?
<user1> of course ! I really love watching football games on TV .
<user0> Me , too ! Do you want to come over and watch the next game at my place ? I'm planning on having a few people over to watch it together .
<user1> sure , that would be great .
<user0> Ok , it's a date then !
<user1> I ' m fine , thanks . Just trying to get adjusted . It ' s hard to keep track of everything around here .
<user0> That ' s for sure . You ' re new , too , huh ?
<user1> Yeah . I just got here a couple of days ago . How about you ?
<user1> Gave me the receipt , please .
<user0> Here is my receipt .
<user1> What's wrong with it ?
<user0> It's too small for me to wear .
<user1> Would you like another bigger one ?
<user0> No thanks . I want to have a refund .
<user1> OK , here is your money .
<user1> What is your favorite color , miss ?
<user0> Red .
<user1> Here you are.It ' s very attractive .
<user0> May I try it on ?
<user1> Go ahead .
<user0> Is there a mirror around here ?
<user1> Right over there .
<user0> Does it suit me ?
<user1> Yes , you look very nice .
<user0> How much is it ?
<user1> We're having a clearance sale . $ 4 plus tax .
<user0> That's quite reasonable .
<user1> May I ask you something ?
<user0> What's your question ?
<user1> How many hours behind the wheel do I need ?
<user0> What do you need to take it for ?
<user1> I'm trying to get my license .
<user0> You need six hours .
<user1> Can I do all six hours in one day ?
<user0> You have to do it in three days .
<user1> That's all I have to do ?
<user0> That's everything .
<user1> Well , that's a relief .
<user1> Yes ? I'll be very glad if I could be of any help to you .
<user0> An hour ago , I bought this vase with my tourist .
<user1> Oh , yes . I remember it clearly . Is there anything wrong with it ?
<user0> I'm afraid so . We found this crack on the bottom when I went back to my hotel .
<user1> Oh , how awful ! Let me have a look , I'm terribly sorry . It was most thoughtless of me . Would you excuse me , please ?
<user0> Oh , It's quite all right , I suppose . It can't be helped sometimes .
<user1> It's very kind of you to say so . How about changing another one for you ?
<user0> All right . Thank you .
<user1> Just a minute , please . I won't be long . I'm sure this one is perfect . You may examine it carefully .
<user0> Oh , yes , it is . I'll take this one .
<user1> I'm very sorry for any inconvenience I've caused you .
<user0> Well , there's no reason to apologize for such a trifle thing .
<user1> Sorry . I was too worried .
<user0> I firmly believe that you love your brother very much .
<user1> Absolutely . By the way , do you sell any traditional Chinese medicine ?
<user0> Yes , we have some Chinese medicine for common cold .
<user1> I heard Chinese medicine has a better lasting effect in cure .
<user0> It depends . It's true that you can take some for prevention .
<user1> It should be close to the university . Neither of us are good at getting up in the mornings and closer it is , the later we can get up .
<user0> Absolutely . That's the most important thing to take into consideration . I'm not too worried about the size of the flat .
<user1> Neither am I . So a small place is ok , but we'll get a bigger one if it's not expensive . Do you mind if it's in a noisy area ?
<user0> I don't mind . i'm not a light sleeper , but quieter is better for when we have to study at home .
<user1> Good point . Ok , let's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us .
<user0> Yes , if we're lucky we'll find something in the next few days . I think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early .
<user1> How much do you think the rent will be ?
<user0> I asked a few people who are already living in places near the university and they said it would cost about one hundred pounds a month .
<user1> Which tooth is it ?
<user0> This one here .
<user1> Ar , Yes . There ' s a big cavity .
<user0> Can you fill it ?
<user1> I ' m afraid not . The tooth is too far gone . it'll have to be taken out .
<user0> Then I might as well have it done now .
<user1> you ' d better wait , the gums are swollen . Take the medicine I prescribe and come back in three days .
<user1> Of course . It's the best one I have here---and it's only 300 yuan .
<user0> Oh , it's really nice , but to tell the truth , that's far too expensive .
<user1> Really ? Even for such an excellent one ?
<user1> The local newspaper has ads for housing .
<user0> Is there any way to find a roommate to share an apartment with ?
<user1> Sometimes you can post an advertisement saying that you need a roommate .
<user0> What do landlords charge for rent ?
<user1> Would you like an apartment for just yourself , or do you need it for two people ?
<user0> There are two of us , but we only need a one-bedroom apartment .
<user1> You should be able to easily find that for twelve hundred dollars a month .
<user0> I really would appreciate it if you could come look at apartments with me .
<user1> Sure , I ' ll go look at apartments with you anytime you want .
<user1> With pleasure .
<user0> I appreciate the building so much . I am wondering if you could take a picture of me against the building .
<user1> No problem .
<user1> Unfortunately , it's just too expensive for majority of consumer to afford .
<user0> Why is the price so high ?
<user1> It's not just that the price is high , it's that the overhead to update an entire computer system to be compatible is costly .
<user0> Model of computers aren't compatible ?
<user1> Most current computer systems simply can't handle it because this model truly has extraordinary capabilities .
<user0> Maybe after the next generation of technology comes out , the price of this model will become more affordable .
<user1> But by then , the technology will be outdated .
<user0> True , but our focus has never been affordability anyway . Coastwise , we may not be very competitive , but qualitywise , we definitely have an edge .
<user1> That's right , no one else has a product on the market now that is comparable .
<user0> This model has advanced technoledge , superior components , it is compact , and it's a top-quality product .
<user1> I guess you get what you pay for .
<user1> what kinds do you have ?
<user0> Oh , yeah , It ' s quite of variety . Regular , cold perm , straight perm , pink curl and form .
<user1> Last time I tried a pink curl perm and form permanent . Set the wave a little loose than as usual , please .
<user1> I'm sorry , sir . I'm not sure I understand .
<user0> I'm talking about the free stuff , like soap and shampoo .
<user1> Oh , I see . So , you're saying that you've already run out of your amenities .
<user0> No , no . I've got plenty left .
<user1> Now I'm confused again ! What is the problem ?
<user0> What am I going to do about souvenirs ?
<user1> Oh , I get it ! You want souvenirs !
<user0> Yes , I've got enough soap for my use , but no extra soap for souvenirs .
<user1> Sir , our souvenir shop carries all those items , and as a guest you get a discount .
<user0> Please ! Free souvenirs are the only true souvenirs .
<user1> I understand completely , sir . Housekeeping will bring you souvenirs in just a moment .
<user1> Well , you can take the No . 36 bus from here , but then you have to walk about 30 minutes .
<user0> That doesn't sound too bad .
<user1> Actually , if you go to the bus stop in the next block , you can take bus 301 which will let you right off in front of the zoo .
<user0> Maybe that's what I'll do . Thanks a lot .
<user1> You're welcome .
<user1> What'd you like , madam ?
<user0> Two muffins and a cup of coffee.Will it take long ?
<user1> No , just a few minutes .
<user1> I ' m doing well .
<user0> How may I help you ?
<user1> Could you cancel a check for me ?
<user0> What ' s the problem ?
<user1> I wrote the check out for way too much .
<user0> How much ?
<user1> I wrote the check out for $ 150 .
<user0> What were you supposed to write it out for ?
<user1> I was supposed to write the check out for $ 100 .
<user0> I ' ll just cancel it for you right now .
<user1> That ' s great . You ' re a lifesaver .
<user1> Yes . Thank you .
<user0> Would you care for a drink before you order ?
<user1> A glass of Qingdao beer .
<user0> Yes , sir . I'll bring it over . Have you decided what you'd like , sir ?
<user1> Will you make some recommendation ?
<user1> Yes , Madam . The reporting desk for the British Airway's flight to London is over there .
<user0> Thank you so much . Is this the desk for BA flight 123 to London ?
<user1> Yes , this is the right desk . Have you any luggage ?
<user0> The suitcase , that ' s all . Except my handbag . Of course .
<user1> Would you please put you suitcase on the scales ? You needn ' t weigh your handbag .
<user0> Is there a receipt ?
<user1> Yes . I ' ll attach your baggage receipt to your ticket .
<user0> What must I do next ?
<user1> You must go to immigration to the departure lounge .
<user1> But I'm not sleepy , Mum . Can I stay and watch more TV ?
<user0> It's already half past eleven . You have school tomorrow . You'll sleepy all tomorrow , if you don't sleep well tonight .
<user1> I know . But I promise I won't be sleepy tomorrow . I work really hard .
<user0> Don't you have the exams coming up soon ? I'm sure you could spend more time preparing for those .
<user1> Oh , I nearly forgot the exams .
<user0> You do well in maths , but your history is not good enough . Am I right ?
<user1> Yeah , I guess so . Maybe I can go to sleep now and get up early to review the lessons tomorrow .
<user0> An excellent idea . Work now and play later .
<user1> I know you're right . School is more important than TV . Can I watch one more show , then go to bed .
<user0> No , now it's bedtime .
<user1> Oh , yes , please . But you are just closing , aren't you ?
<user0> Well , yes , we are , madam . The shop shuts down in five minutes .
<user1> I shall not keep you long then . It was about some saucepans you had in your window last week .
<user0> Last week , madam ? I really can't remember which ones you mean . What were they like ?
<user1> Oh , they were lovely . Sort of imitation wood , dark brown color , country-style you know , and the lids , if I remember rightly , they had a sort of leaf pattern , or was it flowers ?
<user0> That's strange . I don't recognize any of the ones we had from that description . Are you sure they were in this shop ?
<user1> Oh , you must know the ones I mean . They were on sale , a real bargain . Reduced to a quarter of the original price . I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw them .
<user0> I am afraid the sales are over now , madam . And you know we all sold out of the saucepans .
<user1> I don't think you did , you know . My neighbor told me she saw some here only yesterday .
<user0> Well , it's all new stock in the window now .
<user1> May I just have a look , to see if there is anything else ?
<user0> Eh , well , madam , as you know we are closing .
<user1> Yes , yes , I am sorry I won't keep you . It must get on your nerves when customers come in right at closing time . But they were such beautiful saucepans . I ' d have bought them if I had made up my mind on the spot .
<user0> Perhaps madam , if you come back tomorrow , I could show you the whole range of kitchen ware . And there are still one or two things at the sale price .
<user1> Oh , look ! That was the one there . That is the sort of thing I was looking for . But it's not quite the color .
<user0> That might be the artificial lighting , madam . Of course , if you could come back in daylight , you might find it ' s exactly what you are looking for .
<user1> There it is . That is the pattern ! The set behind you . Thank goodness , they haven't been sold . And thank you so much for being so patient with me . Yes , those are the ones .
<user1> We have the offer ready for you . Let me check . 10 boxes with 50 brooches per box , at 20,000 yuan ; 20 boxes with 50 waistbands per box , at 30,000 yuan ; 15 boxes with other ornaments per box , at 7 , 500 yuan , for shipment in June . The offer is valid for five days .
<user0> I can tell you right now that your prices are a little higher than we expected .
<user1> You know that the prices of the ornaments have been rising in recent years . The prices we offer this time compare favorably with quotations you can get else where .
<user0> I am afraid I can't agree with you there . I must point out your prices are higher than the quotations we've received from other companies .
<user1> But you must take the design and quality into consideration . You know we are superior to others in design and quality . We have various styles , which the other companies cannot catch up with .
<user0> I agree that yours are of the top .
<user1> Well , since your order is large enough , can you give me a rough idea ?
<user0> To have this business concluded , I should say a reduction of least 10 % would help .
<user1> Impossible . How about 5 % off ?
<user0> Right . A reduction of 5 % is acceptable .
<user1> Four is an unlucky number here , Peter.Four sounds like death in Chinese.Hotels often have no fourth floor .
<user0> I see.Oh , I know what I wanted to ask.How much should I tip this guy ?
<user1> People don't usually tip here , but you can.Fifty dollars should be more enough .
<user1> I ' d like to make a reservation for my trip from Detroit to Beijing on April 13 on Trans Pacific Airline .
<user0> Do you want a single ticket or a round trip ticket ?
<user1> I ' d like to have a round trip ticket with a one-year open return .
<user0> Economy or Business Class ?
<user1> Economy , please . How much is it ?
<user0> It will be $ 850 .
<user1> Very good . Could I get an electronic ticket ? I ' m always afraid of losing my tickets .
<user0> No problem . How do you wish to pay for it ?
<user1> Bank of American card . The number is 6786 9182 12300 8657 .
<user0> Thank you ! Would you like an aisle seat or a window seat ?
<user1> An aisle seat , please . I ' m tall and need to get up and walk pretty often .
<user0> No problem . Your ticket is for Trans Pacific Flight 87 from Detroit to Beijing at 3 forty p . m . on April 13 . You will arrive at Beijing International Airport at six 35 p . m . on April 14 . Your electronic
<user1> What time should I arrive at Detroit Airport ?
<user0> Please be at the airport two hours before your departure to check in . You also need to reconfirm your reservation with the airline at least 7 days prior to your departure .
<user1> What happens if I can ' t leave on April 13 ? Can I cancel my ticket or change the reservation to another date ?
<user0> Yes , you can , but you will have to pay a penalty of $ 75 for any change or cancellation .
<user1> That ' s OK . What are the weight restrictions for checked baggage ?
<user0> On Trans Pacific international flights , each ticketed passenger is permitted a maximum of two checked bags with a maximum weight per checked bag of 70 pounds .
<user1> That ' s great ! I can have two bags checked for 70 pounds each . I think I ' m all set . You ' re really efficient . Thank you very much for your help .
<user0> Thank you for the compliment and for calling G . O . T . Travel Agency . Have a nice trip !
<user1> Well , I ' ll be glad to help you out . I can come out anytime on Tuesday or Thursday of next week .
<user0> Let ' s put it down for 1:15 on Thursday . We ' ll definitely need some new filing cabinets and at least one desk unit .
<user1> Fine . I ' ll bring both our office furniture and equipment catalogues on Thursday .
<user1> Thank you.But it is too bright for me .
<user0> How about this brown one ?
<user1> Let me try it on . I like that color .
<user0> Ok , i will get one for your.Here you are .
<user1> But it is too loose.Do you have the smaller size ?
<user0> Sorry , it had been sold out .
<user1> What a pity !
<user1> How much would you like to borrow ?
<user0> A thousand dollars .
<user1> Let me check with a credit manager . A record show your credit reading is quite high . I don't think you have any problems .
<user0> What ' s the current interest rate ?
<user1> Our monthly interest is 1.5 % of the outstanding balance . Would you please fill out the application the form ?
<user1> When you flip the tie up , he's right side up . Brilliant .
<user0> My dad will love this . He's a Dilbert fan .
<user1> I wouldn't mind having one myself ...
<user0> Model it for me .
<user1> OK !
<user0> Wow ! You look just as dorky as Dilbert !
<user1> I hope you can give me some advice . I'm sick and tired of coming here or to the post office to pay my utility bills . It's such a long way from my home , but I checked and you are my nearest branch . Is there anyway I can do it from home ?
<user0> That's terrible . Unfortunately , we don't have that many branches outside the centre of town . What I'd advise you to do is set up a Direct Debit Service .
<user1> A Direct Debit Service ? What's that exactly ?
<user0> A Direct Debit means that every month we can arrange for all of your utility bills to come directly out of your account , no fuss , no hassle .
<user1> But how will you know how much I should pay ? I mean , I receive my bills , not you .
<user0> We set up an agreement with the , say , phone company . They tell us how much to pay them every month and we pay directly from your account . Of course , we are able to do this with all of the utilities companies .
<user1> I see . So , that would mean that every month it would just come from my account ? That does sound like a good idea , totally trouble free .
<user1> Hi . It ' s Tony calling from the dentist ' s office . Is Lily there ?
<user0> No , Lily is not here at the moment .
<user1> Could you ask her to call me back when she gets in ?
<user0> Sure . What ' s your number , please .
<user1> 519 367 8901 .
<user0> Thanks . And your name is Tony , right ?
<user1> Yes . I ' m Tony . Thank you very much .
<user0> You ' re welcome . Bye .
<user1> Bye .
<user1> I think it's great ! I really like the color , and it goes really well with your eyes . I've actually been eyeing that dress at Maxine's for a while now , but I wasn't sure I could afford ninety-five dollars for a dress at the moment .
<user0> Um , ninety-five dollars ?
<user1> Yes , that's the price they were advertising it at . I was hoping it might go on sale soon . Why , how much did you pay for it ?
<user0> I bought it for one hundred and forty-five dollars at Helen's Boutique . I didn't know I could get it cheaper somewhere else .
<user1> Of course ! Everything at Helen's is overpriced , and they sell things that you can find at almost every other clothing store ! Why didn't you shop around ?
<user0> I don't know , I just saw the dress and thought about how pretty it looks and how much I wanted it . I guess I was too impulsive .
<user1> I did . Why ?
<user0> Didn't you know dogs shouldn't eat cooked chicken bones because they're bad for their stomachs ?
<user1> No , I didn't . I'm sorry . It won't happen again .
<user1> No , I don't suppose he's to blame.The man in the other car made a mistake .
<user0> But he's equally responsible because he tried to overtake you .
<user1> How to adjust ?
<user0> Exporters must ensure that their product satisfies customers ' needs , wants and likes .
<user1> Ah , some products are successful at home , but not be popular overseas .
<user0> That's because the fashion , taste and social customs and so on vary considerably .
<user1> Yes , sometimes the differences are great .
<user0> Well , we should be in accordance with national conditions and adjust the product .
<user1> We have to ensure that the product should be attractive to guarantee sales .
<user1> Watch your language .
<user1> $ 10 per person .
<user0> Here are $ 30 . By the way , where can I find a guide ?
<user1> Turn to the next window and they will help you find one .
<user0> Thanks a lot .
<user1> Where are you heading now ?
<user0> I want to go back to my college on the Huanghe road.It is very close to your house .
<user1> Is that the university next to the Teachers ' College ?
<user0> That's the one .
<user1> You mean we'll share the taxi ?
<user0> Yeah.If we share the cab , it'll be cheaper.Besides that your Chinese is better than mine.The drivers usually have difficulty understanding me even though I practice my pronunciation carefully .
<user1> Well.Don ' t worry about it , I will be happy to share the taxi with you .
<user1> My name is Liu Lichi . How do you do ?
<user0> How do you do ? Please be seated , How is your trip here ?
<user1> Quite good , I think . I came here by bus , and it took me about 15 minutes .
<user0> Oh , yes.How old are you ?
<user1> Twenty .
<user0> Hum , still a student ?
<user1> Yes , I'm student of grade 3 in the university majoring in economics .
<user0> What subjects are you studying ?
<user1> English , math , commercial and legal studies , and accountancy .
<user0> Have you had any working experience .
<user1> Well , I worked at a supermarket during last summer holidays .
<user0> What do you like to do in your spare time ?
<user1> I like sports very much.Besides that , I also like working on a computer in my spare time .
<user0> How are your English and computer skills ?
<user1> I have passed the CET - 4 and 6.As far as computer is concerned I can use the computer for word processing .
<user0> Okay . Mr.Liu , we'll inform you of the results within a week .
<user1> It ' s too loud .
<user0> We ' Ve been looking around for many hours.What on earth are you looking for ?
<user1> Well , you know , those styles or colors don ' t suit me .
<user0> What style do you want ?
<user1> I want to buy a V-neck checked sweater , and it should be tight .
<user0> Oh , I see.How about the color ?
<user1> Quiet color .
<user0> I know a shop selling this kind of sweaters .
<user1> Really ? Let ' s go there .
<user1> Sure ! What do you feel like having ?
<user0> I really feel like having a big juicy steak !
<user1> Oh . OK . I don't eat meat , but that's fine , I am sure wherever we are going they will have other options right ?
<user0> I didn't know you were a vegetarian !
<user1> I'm not , I am a vegan .
<user0> A what ?
<user1> A vegan . I don't eat or use any animal based products . I don't wear leather , eat eggs , drink milk or anything that comes from an animal . I used to be a pescatarian before , which basically means you don't eat meat , but still have fish and seafood .
<user0> Wow ! That's interesting ! It must be tough !
<user1> It's a bit difficult to find vegetarian friendly restaurants sometimes , but since more and more people are vegetarians or vegans nowadays , it's getting a bit less difficult .
<user1> It wasn't all that great .
<user0> What did you dislike the most ?
<user1> I don't think that they had their act together . They didn't seem well prepared .
<user0> Did you think that the food was any good ?
<user1> I wasn't all that impressed by the food .
<user0> The service certainly could have been better .
<user1> The service did not help the situation .
<user0> Is this a restaurant that you want to come back to ?
<user1> I am not interested in trying this restaurant again .
<user1> No . I am a transit passenger going to Sweden .
<user0> How long are you going to stay here ?
<user1> Only one night .
<user0> Do you have any dutiable items ?
<user1> No , I don't .
<user0> What are these ?
<user1> They are my personal effects .
<user1> First of all , we need to understand what I was looking for . Do you know what the purpose of an inspection is ?
<user0> I am not sure what a home inspection is all about .
<user1> I went there to check for problems with the home , so you aren ' t surprised when you move in .
<user0> Wouldn ' t the owners have told me about any problems ?
<user1> Sellers aren ' t always truthful , and there might also be problems that they aren ' t aware of .
<user0> Can I require the owners to fix the problems ?
<user1> You can make the sale of the house contingent on them fixing the problems .
<user0> What did you find out when you did the inspection of my new home ?
<user1> There were no major problems . One leaky pipe under the sink and two broken roof tiles was all that I found .
<user1> I will take a rain check .
<user1> Tell me what seems to be the problem .
<user0> My roommate always brings a lot of friends from off-campus . They stay in the room until midnight , singing and talking , drinking and playing cards while I have no place for study . I even don't have the quietness to sleep .
<user1> Did you ever talk to him about it ?
<user1> I have a question .
<user0> What do you need to know ?
<user1> I need to take the driver's course . How many hours do I need ?
<user0> It depends on what you're trying to do with the completion of the course .
<user1> I need to get my license .
<user0> You're going to need to complete six hours .
<user1> How many hours a day can I do ?
<user0> You can do two hours a day for three days .
<user1> That's all I need to do to finish ?
<user0> Yes , that's all you need to do .
<user1> Thanks . I'll get back to you .
<user1> Yes , please .
<user0> OK . I'll get the bellman to taka them up . Which bags are yours ?
<user1> My luggage is in the corner over there . They are the leather suitcase , the canvass holdall and the blue backpack .
<user0> OK .
<user1> Please be careful with the suitcase , it's very heavy .
<user0> I'll let the bellboy know . Don't worry , he's very strong .
<user1> And the holdall has some fragile items inside , so please be careful with that too .
<user0> Of course .
<user1> About 50 miles .
<user0> The traffic is not very heavy on this high way , is it ? So I ' m sure we ' ll make it .
<user1> No , but we ' Ve got a hurry . It will be the rush hour soon .
<user0> Don ' t worry . There ' s plenty of time yet .
<user1> But it ' s Friday today . This road is always jam packed during the weekend , isn ' t it ?
<user0> Right .
<user1> Wow ! It's a fruit sculpture ! Your chef is a real artist !
<user0> Actually , uh , I made it myself ...
<user1> You did ? Wow ! Where did you learn ...
<user0> Sorry , but I've gotta run . Enjoy your food , and ring the service button if you need anything else !
<user1> With the fifty forwards he sent out today , maybe we'll inadvertently get inspired .
<user0> I guess this is a good excuse to surf the Net on someone else's dime .
<user1> Who'd have thought Bean would be this kind of e-mail fanatic ?
<user0> He must have just got online for the first time last week . He still thinks it's some kind of new toy .
<user1> I'm happy with that price .
<user0> Let's shake on it .
<user1> Okay , let's shake on it .
<user1> Give me a Big Mac , a small order of French fries and a medium Coke .
<user0> You'll need to wait a few minutes for the fries . They are still in the fryer .
<user1> That's fine .
<user0> Your total comes to $ 7 .
<user1> Here's a twenty . Could you give me some more napkins ?
<user0> Sure . Your cash back is $ 13 . And we'll bring out your fries in two minutes .
<user1> Thanks .
<user1> Miao Ping , in your opinion , should we go for the Type A or Type B Account ?
<user0> Well , the Type B Account is very restricted . If your aim is to use the account the same way as your use your Settlement Account , I would recommend the Type A Account for you .
<user1> Thanks for your time . I'll go and discuss everything with my partner and I'll be back later .
<user1> I've got a really bad headache and my stomach hurts .
<user0> It sounds like you're coming down with something .
<user1> I'll see what I have . What do you need it for ?
<user0> I want to get cigarettes .
<user1> You can use quarters , dimes and nickels .
<user1> May I see your ticket please ?
<user0> Here you are . Do you need to see my passport ?
<user1> Any form of picture I . D . will do .
<user0> Mmmm ... a photo I . D . I have my New Jersey driver ' s license . Is that ok ?
<user1> That will do . What an interesting picture ! How old is it ?
<user0> Actually it wad taken just last year , but I had a shaved head and a beard . Can you still recognize me ?
<user1> Barely . Will you be checking any luggage today ?
<user0> Yes , One suitcase . I also have a carry-on bag .
<user1> Ok . Mr . Lee , you ' re all set . Your flight leaves from gate 10 . Boarding begins at 10:30
<user1> I graduated from Peking University .
<user0> What was your major at university ?
<user1> I studied economics , I am especially interested in the economic development of China .
<user0> What course did you like best ?
<user1> I like Business Management , and i think it's very useful for the present work .
<user0> What do you think is the relationship between the subjects you've taken and the job you are seeking ?
<user1> I've taken courses on office administration , reports and correspondence writing . I think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager , because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager in handling all paperwork .
<user1> We'd better not move him . I'll get the first-aider .
<user1> Quite often . It is very convenient , saving me a lot of time .
<user0> Do you have some experiences to share with me ? I want to have a try .
<user1> You are asking the right person . Here are two very important tips . First , you need to visit no more than one site to find the best products and prices . I can recommend you some online merchants . Second , write your mail address correctly . Otherwise , you can ' t receive your delivery in time .
<user0> What about the registration procedure ? Is that complicated ?
<user1> Not at all . You just need to provide your name , address , e-mail address , phone number and bank or credit card information . I will help you with that .
<user0> It is so nice of you .
<user1> Yeah , you know what ? I've been going to the club regularly . The training really pays off . Now I am in a good shape and I know more about how to keep fit .
<user0> Really ? tell me about it . I haven't gone to the club for a long time . I am too busy with work .
<user1> It's important to do proper exercises .
<user0> You're right . Too much or too little won't do any good .
<user1> The trainer tells me , besides regular sports activities , I should also have a healthy and balanced diet .
<user0> Sounds reasonable .
<user1> We should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic .
<user0> And fruits !
<user1> Surely it is . Getting enough sleep is also crucial for fitness .
<user0> I've heard that . Does your trainer tell you anything about keeping fit ?
<user1> Yeah , he advises me to stay in a good mood . That can also help one to keep sound physical health .
<user0> I think if you follow your trainer's advice , you'll be on the right track .
<user1> You bet it !
<user1> Generally speaking , we provide bikes for both gentlemen and ladies , size 19 , 21 , 23 , 25 and 27 inches . We can vary the colors according to the buyer's requirements . Here are the catalogues and the pattern books . They will give you a rough idea about our products .
<user0> I am interested in your flying pigeon bicycles . I think some of these items will find a ready market in Canada . But what our customers appreciate most is a reliable product .
<user1> To be reliable is the strong point of our products . As a matter of fact , it's always our practice to supply high quality goods at reasonable prices . Flying pigeon is the best of its kind at the price .
<user0> Then I'd like to know your availability of the products and the terms of sales , such as mode of payment , delivery , discounts , etc .
<user1> Well , you know , the traffic in Beijing is sometimes dangerous . Therefore , I have to remind you of something . First , you should obey the traffic rules , don't break in the red light . Second , don't play a joke with your friends when riding on the bike . Third , do not hurry up when riding , or would make an accident . Finally , remember come on the left and go on the right !
<user0> Oh , my dear sister , I am no longer a baby !
<user1> Thank you . But a number of things have been going wrong lately .
<user0> That's too bad . What problems are you having .
<user1> Oh , the whole house needs re-painting for starters . The carpet in the living room is worn out , and I'd like to put in new wall-to-wall carpeting . Last week , I had to call the plumber to fix the toilet . Anyway , all par for the course when you own a house , I guess . I think I am going to hire an interior decorator to look the place over .
<user0> I've studied home decoration as a hobby . Could I make some suggestions ?
<user1> Go right ahead .
<user0> Well , I think a crystal chandelier would look great in your living room , and maybe some new drapes for the windows . Also , a grandfather clock would look great in the den . Perhaps you could buy some potted plants for the dining room
<user1> Wow , you really do have a talent for this , Alice . Thanks for the suggestions .
<user0> You are welcome , Jack . Glad to be of help .
<user1> Nice to see you with us , Anne.Please make yourself at home .
<user0> Thank you.You ' re so considerate .
<user1> There are different types . Which one do you like best ?
<user0> I think the red one fits me well . Can I try it on ?
<user1> Surely , of course .
<user0> Where is the fitting room ?
<user1> It's there , near the mirror .
<user1> Don't worry . You'll be fine . First of all , put on your seat belt . Adjust the mirrors .
<user0> You don't think I'll need the seat belt , do you ?
<user1> Of course not . But it's a good habit to put it on every time you drive .
<user0> Just in case , right ?
<user1> Right . Hold the steering wheel with your hands at ten o'clock and two o'clock .
<user1> I ' m going to England by flight BE987 .
<user0> When is your flight ?
<user1> 10:00 AM . When am I supposed to check in ?
<user0> we are checking in . May I have your ticket and your health certificate and your luggage please .
<user1> Here you are .
<user0> Are you keeping the small bag as carry-on luggage , sir ?
<user1> Yes .
<user0> You must weigh that as well .
<user1> all right .
<user0> Your luggage is two pounds over . I ' m afraid They'll be in excess luggage charge , Sir .
<user1> How much must I pay ?
<user0> It ' s ten yuan .
<user1> Here you are .
<user0> This is your luggage check Which You must show when you disembark at your destination and here is your boarding pass and your ticket .
<user1> Thanks .
<user0> Now , please wait until your flight is called . There's about twenty-five minutes to go .
<user1> I ' m a little nervous . I ' Ve never flown before .
<user0> There ' s nothing at all to worry about . Once you are in the air , it ' s just like sitting at your sitting room . It ' s going to be a very pleasant flight .
<user1> Yes , please .
<user0> Will this table be all right ?
<user1> Actually , I'd like a booth by the window if that's possible .
<user0> Certainly . How about this one ?
<user1> This will be fine , thanks .
<user0> ( Handing her a menu ) Your waiter will be here in a minute to take your order .
<user1> Thank you .
<user1> What is your problem ?
<user0> My children can never be obedient even if I criticized them severely .
<user1> You need not always do that . Why don ' t you pat them on the back occasionally ?
<user1> Sorry , sir . That table has been booked .
<user0> Well , in that case , this table is the only choice .
<user1> Actually you can have a window seat if you don't mind a ten-minute wait .
<user0> There is no need . Thanks .
<user1> So am I .
<user0> Where should we go eat today ?
<user1> How about we go eat in the cafeteria ?
<user0> I never bought food from the cafeteria .
<user1> You haven't ? They have a lot of good stuff .
<user0> What do they have ?
<user1> They sell everything .
<user0> Well , I want Chinese food .
<user1> I've gotten chow mein from there before .
<user0> I guess we can eat there then .
<user1> Trust me , the food isn't half bad .
<user1> I do . Why , do you want me to change the channel ?
<user0> Yes , please . I can't stand watching the channel any more .
<user1> I think they have pretty good programmes . But I'll change it if you really want .
<user0> Put it on Channel 5 , OK ?
<user1> Oh , I hate Channel 5 . I'd rather just listen to the radio .
<user0> Don't make such a fuss . I'm sure you will like today's programme .
<user1> What's on today ?
<user0> A basketball match between Chinese team and American team .
<user1> Really ? I'm interested in it .
<user0> It might begin now .
<user1> Did you send in your Continued Claim Form for the last period ?
<user0> I think I forgot to send it in !
<user1> You need to be very careful to send that form in every two weeks if you want to get paid .
<user0> Can I send it in now ?
<user1> You should look at your claim form and see if it has been more than fourteen days since it was due . If it hasn ' t been , we will still accept it .
<user0> Can I mail it in early next time so it isn ' t late ?
<user1> Actually , you cannot mail it in early , as it needs to reflect all of the information up to the due date .
<user0> Will my paycheck come right away now ?
<user1> Your check will arrive a little late .
<user1> Yes , I am .
<user0> I'm pleased to meet you , Mrs . Green . My name is Myra . I work in Beijing Institute of Technology . I came here to meet you .
<user1> How do you do ?
<user0> How do you do ?
<user1> It's kind of you to meet me at the airport .

<user0> Gee , I'm sorry . I don't watch TV .
<user1> I don't know . I just know I've never been asked so many questions in my life .
<user0> How many of them were there ?
<user1> Three-but there was one of them who kept asking really stupid questions .
<user0> Like what ?
<user1> Oh , he wanted to know what time I got up this morning and if I bad a bath or a shower you know , things like that .
<user0> What on earth has that got to do with some money disappearing ?
<user1> I've no idea . Oh yes , and the most ridiculous thing . He asked me what I had for breakfast this morning .
<user0> Oh well , that's it . They obviously think you're a desperate criminal and you have to steal to eat . I should think you'll get thirty years .
<user1> Hmm . Thank you very much .
<user1> Sorry . I'll clean it up .

<user0> I hope so . Thank you for saying so .

<user0> I got poison oak while hiking , and I need something to help me with the itching .
<user1> I can suggest a product called Techne that comes in a lotion or cream .
<user0> Which do you prefer ?
<user1> Hikers tell me that the cream is best because it stays on longer .
<user0> Is there anything else I can do to help with the itching ?
<user1> You can take an antihistamine .
<user0> Thank you so much for all of the information .
<user1> You are welcome . Please feel free to ask me a question any time you need help .

<user0> Do you know where that memo about office procedures is ? I want to give my secretary a copy .

<user1> I am sorry.The flight is late.Please go to the waiting room for further notice .
<user0> I don't want to miss my flight .
<user1> Don't worry . We will keep you well informed .
<user0> Thank you .
<user1> No ! My tour bus got a speeding ticket not ten minutes ago . Now my engine is on fire !
<user0> I think that's just steam . Your engine's overheated .
<user1> Do you know a lot about cars ?
<user0> A little bit . I'll take a look if you want me to .
<user1> Please . Thank you so much for stopping .
<user0> Yeah , she's hot . Radiator's leaking . Looks like you were running her pretty hard .
<user1> That must have been just before I got the speeding ticket .
<user0> Did you have an accident recently ... Hey , wait a second ! I know this car !
<user1> You do ?
<user0> I ran into it a couple of weeks ago . What do you know ? Name's Hal .
<user1> I'm Akimbo . Nice to meet you , I guess .
<user0> Boy , I'm sure sorry about your car . Hey , Akimbo , I wonder if you'd like to make a deal ?
<user1> What kind of deal ?
<user0> I'd like to give you cash for the damage to your car .
<user1> You don't want your insurance company to pay for it ?
<user0> I'd rather not . They'll raise my rates . It'll cost me more in the long run .
<user1> If you give me cash , do you care if I don't fix the car ?
<user0> Hell , I don't care . Just don'T submit a report to your insurancecompany .
<user1> It's a deal , Hal . Thanks again for stopping to help . And thanks for smashing my car !
<user1> What are the allowances ?
<user0> If you go on a business trip , you will enjoy the allowance . It is 200 yuan per day .
<user1> Well , I see . And what about the vacation in our company ?
<user0> As a new-comer , you usually have five days of annual vacation . And remember you have to fill out a request form , if you want to ask for leave .
<user1> Will our company have some recreational activities ?
<user0> Of course . In spring and autumn , we will hold some sports actives . And in movie seasons , we bulk purchase film tickets .
<user1> $ 60 .
<user0> I am sure you can do better than that .
<user1> Sorry , sir . It's the sale price .
<user0> Well , what about $ 70 with a scarf ?
<user1> It's my rock bottom price . Take it or leave it .
<user1> I am afraid not . Are there any vacant tables ?
<user0> I don't think so . You have to wait for about 10 minutes .
<user1> That's all right .
<user1> Yes , what do you want to know ?
<user0> The information is scanty for me . And can you describe the responsibilities of the position ?
<user1> Yes . Copywriters are supposed to design and write articles for the advertising company .
<user1> I'd like to have it in big waves .
<user0> Shall I put some oil on ? B
<user1> I'm glad to see you !
<user0> Sit down , please . Maybe you have read the contract , but I want to give you the details again before you sign the contract . You must have a three-month internship .
<user1> Yes , I know .
<user0> When you become a permanent employee , you will have the insurances . You will get monthly pay and will be on eight-hour / day work shift .
<user1> Wait , will I have five insurances and one fund ?

<user0> If you need to work overtime , you will get twice the usual salary as overtime pay .
<user1> OK .
<user0> You have read the relevant terms of the contract . Do you have other questions ?
<user1> How long will the induction training be ?
<user0> About two weeks .
<user1> I see .
<user0> If you don't have other questions , just sign here .
<user1> OK .
<user1> I'm ready now . I'd like the roast chicken and a side order of corn .
<user0> And would you like an appetizer before your meal ? The soup of the day is our delicious tomato soup .
<user1> I'll pass on the soup , but I'd like a garden salad .
<user0> Can I get you anything to drink ? :
<user1> Yes , I'd like a glass of iced tea .
<user0> Okay . I'll be back in a minute with your drink and salad .
<user1> Thank you .
<user1> I'd love to .
<user0> First , put away your toys .
<user1> OK .
<user0> I'll get the flour out .
<user1> Let me help you .
<user1> Thank you for allowing us 3 % reduction , but still we find your price is on the high side .
<user0> This is our rock-bottom price , and we can't make any further reduction .
<user1> If so , we find it difficult for us to go on with our talks .
<user0> Then what ' s your counter-offer ?
<user1> This is our counter-offer .
<user0> We are sincere to make business with you , but the difference between your counter-offer and our price is too great .
<user1> So are we . Our counter-offer is in line with the world market .
<user0> How about meeting each other half-way in order to conclude the business ?
<user1> Agreed .
<user1> I usually have cereal for breakfast .
<user0> But isn't it served with cold milk ?
<user1> Yeah . Cold milk wakes me up .
<user0> Chinese people don't like to eat cold food .
<user1> Is that right ?
<user0> But I'm open to new things . I'll have a bowl of cereal , too .
<user1> With cold milk ?
<user0> With cold milk !
<user1> That is very encouraging news . I heard that the marketing department has done a three months research , they sent the feedback information to the research and development center by the end of every month . That is to say , the R & D center redesigned the product twice before it was launched into the market .
<user0> It is not an easy job . How do you like the advertisement for the new product ?
<user1> That is the best one I have seen . I am sure our target customers , young people will love it .
<user0> Certainly .
<user1> Our computer lab on the first floor has a copy machine , sir .
<user0> Great ! How much per copy ?
<user1> Sir , one copy is ten cents .
<user0> Okay , I'll be down there shortly .
<user1> You probably won't have to wait for anyone , sir .
<user1> Thanks , Jim . I didn ' t think guys paid attention to stuff like that .
<user0> No , we just don ' t usually admit it !
<user1> Well , thanks for the compliment anyway !
<user1> Yes . Now we are in the Olympic stadium , the center of this park .
<user0> Splendid ! When is it gonna be finished ?
<user1> The whole stadium is to be finished this June .
<user0> How many seats are there in the stand ?
<user1> Oh , there are 5000 seats in total .
<user0> I didn ' t know it would be so big !
<user1> It is ! Look there , those are the tracks . And the jumping pit is over there .
<user0> Ah ... I see . Hey , look the sign here , No climbing .
<user1> We put many signs with English translations for foreign visitors .
<user1> OK . Well the problem is that the apartments in the heart of the city are usually more expensive .
<user0> I know , that's my problem . What do you think I should do ?
<user1> Well , maybe you could get a two-bedroom apartment downtown and share the rent with a roommate .
<user0> Oh , great idea !
<user1> Well , I love it . The room is spacious and clean with big windows and a lot of sunshine . There are plants along the corridor . Especially , I got my own desk with computer and telephone . Such a great place !
<user0> That ' s very good . I once turn down a job offer just because the office is awful .
<user1> What was so bad about it ?
<user0> Small rooms , small window , a small desk shared by three people . I would have been interrupted all the time and for sure not be able to deliver good work .
<user1> Sounds bad ! Lucky you ! You didn ' t take that job . I think a good office environment is also important to work efficiently .
<user0> Totally agree . By the way , the number of the telephone on your desk is extension 506 . You can pick up your office supplies from the supply room at the end of the corridor .
<user1> Yes , that ' s right . After graduating from high school in New York I attended York University in the UK . My major was English , and my minor was business studies . I completed my BA in 2004 .
<user0> Yes , I ' m pleased to see that you also got a distinction .
<user1> Yes that ' s right . I ' Ve always enjoyed studying . My friends say I ' m a bit of a bookworm , but my father always pushed us to succeed academically .
<user0> Well , it looks like his encouragement paid off Rebecca . So how about extracurricular activities at University ?
<user1> Well I ' Ve always been keen on writing , so I became the editor for the University student magazine , which I really loved . Also I volunteered for a group called Shelter , to help the homeless in York .
<user0> What did that involve ?
<user1> Providing warm meals and shelter , especially in the winter months . I found it really fulfilling to be part of that group .
<user0> I ' m sure . Okay , now let ' s move on to your work experience , shall we ?
<user1> Yes , okay .
<user1> What would you like ?
<user0> Twenties and some smaller bills , please .
<user1> Anything else ?
<user0> Yes . Could you tell many balance ? Here's account number .
<user1> It's nothing serious . But I always have a headache , and I haven't slept properly for several weeks . I've also lost appetite and my eyes are burning .
<user0> Mm , you do look rather pale . Let me take your temperature . Would you put the thermometer under your arm , please ? Now , let me listen to your pulse . Mm , do you feel weak ?
<user1> Yes , I never seem to have any energy .
<user0> I'll give you a blood test . Would you roll up your sleeve ? Just as I thought . You're anemic . You'd better pay more attention to your diet . Eat plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables and food high in protein . And don't stay up late working . Try to get more rest .
<user1> Thank you .
<user1> Do you have a map of the campus ?
<user0> Yes , I have , but it doesn ' t help me very much . I ' m not very good at reading maps .
<user1> Do you know where your classes are ?
<user0> More or less . I go to three different buildings , and always get there late . I feel so hopeless . I don ' t know why I am late all the time . No one else seems to be .
<user1> That's because you don't know the short cuts . You'll learn them after a while . I can show you the ropes .
<user1> Which train do you like ?
<user0> T112 to Washington please .
<user1> May I have your name ?
<user0> That's Lincoln .
<user1> I can ' t wait to vote .
<user0> Who are you voting for ?
<user1> The person I ' m voting for is the best .
<user0> What do you like about him ?
<user1> He is very intelligent .
<user0> You think so ?
<user1> That ' s right . Plus , I agree with his policies .
<user0> I ' m glad to hear that you are so excited .
<user1> I ' m voting for the next President .
<user0> I ' m sure he will be .
<user1> I ' m going to make sure and vote .
<user1> Yes , I'd like to check out now . My name's Adams , room 312 . Here's the key .
<user0> One moment , please , sir . ... Here's your bill . Would you like to check and see if the amount is correct ?
<user1> What's the 14 pounds for ?
<user0> That's for the phone calls you made from your room .
<user1> Can I pay with traveller's cheques ?
<user0> Certainly . May I have your passport , please ?
<user1> Here you are .
<user0> Could you sign each cheque here for me ?
<user1> Sure .
<user0> Here are your receipt and your change , sir . Thank you .
<user1> Thank you . Goodbye .
<user1> I tend to work well with people who are confident and straightforward.It ' s more difficult for me to be around timid people , because I move quickly and I am decisive .
<user0> What things impress you in your colleagues ?
<user1> I admire and work best with people who are of good character and integrity . I also think confidence and enthusiasm is positive in any business environment .
<user0> What are some of the things your supervisor did that you disliked ?
<user1> The only thing I really don't like is to get feedback in front of others . I want to hear good and bad feedback in private , so that I have time to think and react to the issue without other distractions . I believe that's the fair way to improve learning or to change future behavior .
<user0> How do you organize and plan for major projects ?
<user1> I love to brainstorm a best , worst , and most likely scenario.Then , I set a timetable that's realistic.What I usually find is that some combination of my schedule easily as these things unfold because I've already visualized what could happen and how I'd react .
<user0> Describe an experience when you had to work under great pressure .
<user1> I had to complete an end of quarter report once while I was on the road for two consecutive weeks.The amount of telephoning back and forth was incredible , because I could't bring my office files with me.Luckily I had a great secretary and a logical filling system , so we located everything we needed .
<user0> How do you manage your time in a typical day ?
<user1> I've always given priority to work with established clients , because they offer a better risk / return value.The last thing I do is general correspondence , especially internal correspondence , which I take care of at the end of the day or week .
<user0> Describe a time when you acted on someone's suggestion .
<user1> I changed my open office hours because several of my employees found it difficult to visit me except in the early mornings .
<user1> Yeah , I deleted all that superstitious crap . What a waste of bandwidth !
<user0> I figured I might as well send one or two of them out . Maybe my luck will get better .
<user1> Do you really think the Dalai Lama sent that ? I'm tired of all these forwards .
<user0> It's worth a shot . Maybe we'll get some luck in thinking up something for this case .
<user1> You are not late , Mr . Thomas . There're still 15 minutes to go . Mr . White has just called you .
<user0> What did he say ?
<user1> He said there was a traffic jam , but he is coming .
<user0> He shouldn't drive his car . He should come here by bus .
<user1> Some what ?
<user0> Some Chinese food . I'm hungry , and there's a take-out restaurant near here . We can have them deliver and then watch the news on TV while we eat .
<user1> No , I'd rather go out . The Chinese food here is rather different from what I had at home . Maybe we can try some other food today ... What about that all-you-can-eat place we passed the other day , the one over in the shopping center ?
<user0> Okay . I could go for that . It's called Al's Steakhouse . They also have great fried fish , and I love their salad bar . You can go back to refill your plate as often as you like .
<user1> Is that the place that serves such large portions of meat ?
<user0> Yes , their steaks are enormous . Sometimes I can't finish what I've ordered .
<user1> What if that happens to me ? I hate to let food go to waste .
<user0> Don't worry . We'll just get a doggie bag .
<user1> I know something about it . Our company often organizes all kinds of lectures to improve our professional skills .
<user0> It takes most of our weekends to listen to these boring lectures , so I can not bear it anymore . It is said that they think out some tests to check our management skills .
<user1> Is that true ?
<user0> Definitely !
<user1> If that information is exact , I guess our company is willing to promote someone .
<user1> I would like to buy some flowers , please . Something really nice .
<user0> I see , may I ask what the occasion is ?
<user1> It ' s not really an occasion , it ' s more like I ' m sorry .
<user0> Very well.This arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . It has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . It includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness .
<user1> I think I ' m gonna need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . What else do you recommend ?
<user0> Mmm , well this is our I ' m sorry I cheated on you package . Two dozen red roses lined with tulips , carnations and lilies . The fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you .
<user1> I don ' t think that ' s gonna cut it . I need something bigger and better !
<user0> I ' m sorry sir but , what exactly did you do ?
<user1> Well , I may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting chubbier .
<user0> Get out of my store , you jerk !
<user1> I'm very sorry , sir . I could put you on a waiting list , but you would be wise to check out other means of travel .
<user0> You mean like a bus ? Have you ever traveled for ten hours on a bus before ?
<user1> I have not sir . But I do have a number for a very comfortable bus that goes to Chicago every hour from here .
<user0> Alright , give me the number . But put me on that waiting list as well .
<user1> Here is the number , and your name is on the waiting list .
<user0> How many people are on the waiting list right now ?
<user1> Right now I show that there are 176 people on the list . And you are number 176 .
<user1> I don't think that there is any easy way . The United Nations could send peacekeepers into the country . At least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate .
<user0> So , if the cause is poverty , there should be a program to make the country richer.If the problem is resources , share them .
<user1> It sounds easy when you say it like that . In reality , it's harder to make peace between countries .
<user0> Yes , it is.One way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . Wars are very expensive .
<user1> I ' m sorry , Mr . Myers . I ' Ve just been so busy today .
<user0> I really don ' t want to hear your excuses , Janet . We ' re running a busy office here . You ' re going to have to keep up .
<user1> You ' re right , sir . I apologize . I ' ll get those files for you now .
<user1> I prefer a sedentary job and I used to work as an operator .
<user0> We need an operator now .
<user1> It's just the job I've been searching for .
<user1> I know . It really makes a mess of the whole election process .
<user0> And it takes up all the news .
<user1> The problem is that there always a large number of people who eat that kind of stuff up .
<user0> It's so small . The fact that there is public interest , doesn't say much for us as the public .
<user1> Have you ever listened to AM radio ? It's quite a different experience than the traditional news stations on TV and FM radio .
<user0> I don't remember the last time I listened to AM radio .
<user1> Another place you can get real insight is European papers . You can get them on-line .
<user1> I can check that for you right now . Would you mind holding ?
<user0> Sure . No problem .
<user1> Mr . Robson , I'm sorry . Our computer system is down . Could I call you back later ?
<user0> Sure . Do you have my number ?
<user1> Yes , I have it right here . I'm so sorry about this .
<user0> No problem . I'll wait for your call .
<user1> I'm working on my resume .
<user0> Really ? Did you find any information about a new job ?
<user1> Yeah , I just got some good information off the internet .
<user0> Great ! Do you think you have a chance at getting the job ?
<user1> I didn ' t just find out about one job . There were several ones that looked good .
<user0> Maybe I should try looking on the web for work .
<user1> Sure you have to be patient . But I think it ' s much less trouble to sit in front of a computer than to go door to door or to make a lot of phone calls .
<user0> But there must be so many people who also see the advertisement for that job on the net . You might have no chance .
<user1> How do you know if you don ' t have a try ?
<user1> Is this the one you want ?
<user0> No , the one next to it .
<user1> Here you are .
<user0> Thanks . What kind of stone is this ?
<user1> It's a ruby . It is from South Africa . Would you like to try it on ?
<user0> Yes , please . How much is it ?
<user1> It costs $ 200 .
<user0> It looks good . OK . I'll take it .
<user1> Thank you , Lisa .
<user0> Here is a present for you . I hope you like it .
<user1> Oh , great ! I love it ! You know I've been expecting this for a long time .
<user0> I'm very glad to hear that .
<user1> Come here , let me introduce some friends to you .
<user1> I'm not sure , I feel hot and cold .
<user0> When did the trouble start ?
<user1> I was sick most of the night .
<user0> It sounds like you are coming down with the flu . Let me take your temperature .
<user1> Have I got a high fever ?
<user0> Yes , thirty-eight point seven . Do you have a headache , chest or throat pain ?
<user1> Yes , I have .
<user0> Now , let me have a look at you . I'd like to listen to your chest . Now breathe in , a deep breath , that's it Cough , now again . I want to examine your throat , too . Open wide , say ' Ah - - '
<user1> Aaaaahh , aaaaahh .
<user0> Yes , it does look a bit sore . Let's take an X-ray of your chest and give you a few tests .
<user1> All right , thanks .
<user0> The tests showed nothing wrong . A slight viral infection .
<user1> What shall I do today ?
<user0> I'm giving you some antibiotics and aspirins . Take an aspirin when you've got a fever , and take one antibiotic capsule every four hours , and go home and rest in bed for two days . Drink plenty of water , then you'll feel better . Here's the prescription .
<user1> You can be sure of that , sir .
<user0> Thank you .
<user1> What did they say ?
<user0> They said I need a new hard drive .
<user1> That's too bad . How much is a new one ?
<user0> It's not too much , only about $ 85 .
<user1> Plus installation ?
<user0> No , my hard drive is easy to remove and replace .
<user1> Really ?
<user0> Yes , it's just a couple of screws .
<user1> That's nice .
<user0> It's a lot better than paying someone $ 60 .
<user1> If my hard drive crashes , I'll just call you .
<user1> Don't get up so late next time . You should have gone to bed earlier last night .
<user0> Yes , Mum .
<user1> I ' m worried about my daughter . She can ' t decide about college .
<user0> Don ' t worry . That ' s just a part of being a teenager .
<user1> I don ' t mind that . But she disagrees with me about everything .
<user0> You should encourage her to make up her mind by herself . You shouldn ' t affect her decision .
<user1> But I just want to give her some tips .
<user0> Oh , she can make her own decisions .
<user1> I guess you are right .
<user0> Believe me . Everything will be ok .
<user1> I hope so .
<user1> Yes . I feel refreshed .
<user0> How long will we dock ?
<user1> In half an hour . The surface of the lake is calm .
<user0> Yes . We come at the right time .
<user1> It sure was . I couldn't eat another bite .
<user0> well , it is getting pretty late . I think we should go home .
<user1> you're right . I have to get up early to go to work tomorrow .
<user0> let's see how much the bill is .
<user1> don't worry about it . Tonight is my treat .
<user0> what are you talking about ? We'll split the bill .
<user1> no , I insist . I kept telling you that I would treat you to dinner but I still haven't .
<user0> no way , Gordon . I know that you are a little short on cash at the moment . There's no need for you to pay for the whole bill .
<user1> alright , if that's the way you are going to be , we'll split the bill .
<user0> that's better . This way we will both have money to take a cab home , otherwise , you would probably have to walk .
<user1> just promise you will let me treat you to dinner next week , ok ?
<user0> you've got a deal .
<user1> great . Bye .
<user0> bye .
<user1> Yes . I'm going to the Untied States for travel . What places do you recommend ?
<user0> In my opinion , there are several places you mustn't miss , like Washington D . C , Las Vegas , New York and Los Angeles .
<user1> Someone suggests that I should go to Seattle and Hawaii .
<user0> Yes , you may consider those two places also . Seattle , for example , is worth visiting and there's a very famous museum called Museum of Flight .
<user1> And Seattle is the home of Microsoft and Boeing . That must be a great place . I can't miss it .
<user1> You know , I fell in love with this house the first moment I laid eyes on it .
<user0> The style of the exterior is just what I ' Ve been looking for !
<user1> The exterior is only half of the story . The interior is incredible .
<user0> This home is gorgeous on the inside !
<user1> Everything that you see on the walls , floors , and windows is brand new .
<user0> The wall colors totally suit the style of this house .
<user1> Straight ahead is the gourmet kitchen .
<user0> I love the bamboo flooring and granite countertops .
<user1> The master suite is the best . Let ' s go look at that next .
<user0> There is plenty of room for our king-sized bed , and I love the light in this room .
<user1> I know that you like this house , but let ' s take a look at the others before you make up your mind .
<user1> l am afraid there isn't any fancy soap in my room .
<user0> Sorry sir , we will bring you one.Anything else ?
<user1> Yes.Bring me a bath towel as well .
<user1> Can I make a reservation for flight FW58 to San Marino ?
<user0> Sure . When do you want to take the plane ?
<user1> Next Monday .
<user0> Will that be first class or economy seat ?
<user1> What's the fare for a first class seat ?
<user0> $ 200 .
<user1> Oh . I am not a wall streeter.Give me an economy one please .
<user1> Yes , hello again . I would like to know the exact difference between Dividend Deposit and Dividend Participated Deposit .
<user0> That's pretty easy to explain . With the Deposit , the interest is fixed , but the Dividend of each policy will be transferred automatically into your bank account by the end of each year . The longer the term , the higher the Dividend you earn . This is because it is calculated at the Compound Interest Rate .
<user1> And I can purchase that here ?
<user0> Yes . And if you already have a Current Account with us , the Insurance Premium can be paid through it , which saves all of us a lot of hassle .
<user1> Yes , what kind of room do you want ?
<user0> I prefer one facing the sea . Besides , it should have a shower .
<user1> Sorry , right now we can only have you a room without shower .
<user0> Well , that's fine .
<user1> That's easy . It was your office ergonomics that decided me .
<user0> You're kidding ! Something as simple as that ?
<user1> Yes . It is very important to me . My mother worked in offices for twenty years , and she finally had carpal tunnel syndrome . I have been reading about repetitive stress injuries , and I know that t
<user0> Yes , there has been a lot of research into RSI's . Something so simple as proper chair height can prevent injuries . Tell me , did anything else influence your decision ?
<user1> Yes , I noticed that you have professional training and team-building days . I like the idea of working for a company that invests in its staff .
<user0> Well , welcome to the team .
<user1> Oh , thank you .
<user0> Is there anything I can do for you now ?
<user1> Yes . I'm rather tired and want to go to bed early . Please make the bed .
<user0> Certainly , sir .
<user1> Marry Lin please .
<user0> Sure , just a moment . ... I'm sorry no one answer the phone .
<user1> All right , could I leave a message ?
<user0> Certainly !
<user1> Please ask her to call John .
<user1> Well , that's what I'm looking for myself .
<user0> It's very confusing in here , isn't it ?
<user1> Absolutely . Oh , do you see a sign there ?
<user0> It should be the way out .
<user1> OK . Let's go and see .
<user1> Well , sir , I think I have made a mistake . I will take it back to the kitchen right now .
<user0> I think you should be more careful next time .
<user1> Yes , sir . I'm really so sorry about that .
<user1> Look , Sally . I ' Ve put just as much work into this as anybody else .
<user0> No , I ' m sorry . I disagree . I don ' t think you ' Ve been working at full speed at all .
<user1> Well . I ' m sorry you feel that way .
<user1> Things are going good today . How have you been doing , Mary ?
<user0> Things are going well for me , Joe .
<user1> Want to go see a movie tonight ?
<user0> My parents are taking me to dinner tonight .
<user1> Could you go with me to the movies on Friday night , instead ?
<user0> What movie did you want to see ?
<user1> There is a new horror flick about a rapist serial killer .
<user0> I was thinking that I would like to see “ The Secret Life of Bees . ”
<user1> Oh great ! Sounds like something I need to bring Kleenex to !
<user1> Tired and stressed . This wedding is giving me a headache .
<user0> Just relax . With me as your maid of honor , everything will be fine !
<user1> I'm worried that everything will be chaotic !
<user0> Hey ! I'm the tour guide . I'll take care of the Taiwanese guests .
<user1> You're going to have to tell them what to do in church , what everything means ...
<user0> I will . Don't worry !
<user1> Nothing , Mummy . I was hungry so I came here for some milk .
<user0> Milk ? I thought you didn't like milk .
<user1> I don't , but I couldn't find anything to eat in the refrigerator .
<user0> Nonsense . There's lots of food in the refrigerator ... What's behind your back ?
<user1> Nothing .
<user0> What are you hiding behind your back ? Let me see .
<user1> Promise that you won't get angry .
<user0> OK , I promise . What is it ?
<user1> It's a kitty .
<user0> Oh , Jim . I told you . No pets . It'll make a mess of this house .
<user1> Please , Mummy . Everybody else in my class keeps a pet . Please , I'll take care of it . It's a good kitty . It'll not bring you any trouble .
<user0> No way . It might belong to somebody else . You can't keep it here .
<user1> Please , Mummy . I found it this afternoon by the garbage bin . It was starving and looking for something to eat . Please ! You see , it's so cute and tame .
<user0> All right . But you have to clean up everything it messes up .
<user1> I will . Thank you , Mummy .
<user1> Sure , anything you say .
<user0> Actually , it ' s a little bit silly .
<user1> Don ' t worry about it , just ask .
<user0> What words do I need to know to buy a pair of shoes ?
<user1> You need to know the type of shoes you want .
<user0> Don ' t worry about that . I can point it out in the store .
<user1> The shoes can be comfortable or not comfortable , too wide , too narrow , or just right ; and long or short . In girls shoes , the heel can be high or low .
<user0> Let me write all that down . I ' m going shopping this afternoon .
<user1> It has been 12 years since it was founded in 1998 .
<user0> So , it has a history for more than a decade ?
<user1> Yes . And it was incorporated with other businesses in 2008 due to the global financial crisis .
<user1> Can you help me with Comprehensive Credit Granting ?
<user0> Certainly , Madam . What would you like to know ?
<user1> Well , everything really .
<user0> All right . We can grant a Financing Promise Quota , if you qualify . This means that we can deal with all of your needs in a speedy and efficient way . Firstly , your Credit Rating must be class A , and your Debt to Asset Ratio must be top notch , for the industry you are involved in .
<user1> All right . But I don't want to play tennis . We played tennis last weekend .
<user0> Okay . what do you want to do ?
<user1> I want to go jogging .
<user0> All right . That sounds like fun .
<user1> I am terribly sorry . You didn't come to reconfirm recently.You should have come to pick up your ticket three days ago since it's an international flight , any reservation without reconfirmation within 72 hours will be cancelled .
<user0> But I have been so busy all these days.Well , is there any other ticket available ? I want the next one .
<user1> Does that suggest diners avoid speaking much ? The same is true in the West .
<user0> No , absolutely not ! On the contrary , you'll be considered a well-connected , sociable man , if you keep involved in the conversation all the time . But always pay attention to what you say . If the table has a senior guest , say something as upbeat and cheerful as possible . Or maybe , you may give the floor to him and keep listening as if very interested .
<user1> You mean , keeping a low profile in the presence of the old ? That goes in like with Confucius ' preachings , right ?
<user0> Correct . Show respect for the older people . Conventionally , before the meal starts , the younger members are supposed to address each one of the elderly members of the table one by one . Others are kept in waiting until the most venerable guest proclaim the beginning of the meal and takes the first bite . Toasts also go to these men first before people can toast to each other .
<user1> Any other rules to observe in order to keep modest ?
<user0> Yes , plenty of them . Don't eat fast ! People usually keep their dining pace accorded with others . And all the dishes should not be eaten up completely .
<user1> Is it because that would give the host the impression that the food was insufficient ?
<user0> Haha , I'm afraid it's simply because no one wishes to be too noticeable by finishing off the plate .
<user1> We will need new cartridges for all of the office printers ? That will be a large order , probably about two or three cases . The office supply store we usually go through might not have that many in stock .
<user0> You can double check with the housekeeping department , but I am pretty sure all of the machines will need new cartridges . Last time when we made our order to the supplier , the quantity was also especially high . They are used to receiving such bulk orders from us . As long as we give them a heads up a couple days in advance , they can usually fill the order .
<user1> OK , I will make a few calls and run our order by housekeeping first to make sure . Is there anything else we need to order while I am at it ?
<user0> I think the only thing is toner . Try to see if they can deliver it before the end of business day tomorrow . We should really try to do better about waiting until the last minute to fill orders that are usually made on a monthly basis . Anyhow , see what you can do to expedite the order this time .
<user1> OK , will do .
<user1> What size do you want ?
<user0> I wear size 40 .
<user1> How about this one ? It's the latest design .
<user0> Oh , I like the color .
<user1> I'm looking for a pair of shoes .
<user0> What size do you wear ? These shoes are on sale .
<user1> I wear size 36.This pair looks nice.Can I try them on ?
<user0> Of course , yes.They look nice.And they're not expensive .
<user1> How much are they ?
<user0> They are $ 168 .
<user1> I'll take them .
<user1> I think it is good if we know enough about career planning . We will make wiser choices . What else did he tell you about it ?
<user0> Well , just something in general , like several key steps in planning career and how to set specific and tenable goals .
<user1> Sounds practical ! To be honest , sometimes I feel puzzled about my future career . I am not sure if this job suits me the best though I work very hard on it and enjoy being a hard worker . I have always wanted to try something else and learn some new skills .
<user0> Making a decision to start over is not an easy thing to do . It seems that you need this course more than I do . I love my current job . If I take this course , I hope to learn some tricks to get myself more organized at work . If they can give suggestions about how to boost work relationships , that will be great . I need these to improve my current work performance .
<user1> Ok , then we can sign up for it together .
<user1> I think it's the postman.Will you go and open the door ?
<user0> All right . I'll get it .
<user1> No , we don't .
<user0> How many of you , please ?
<user1> Six , including two kids .
<user0> I'm afraid all the big tables are taken .
<user1> If you go onto our website and put in your password , you can access your test results .
<user0> Are you saying that there weren ' t any problems ?
<user1> I will always have you come in for a discussion if there is a major problem .
<user0> Will I be able to read the results on the website and understand them ?
<user1> Yes , if you go there , you can see what each test is about .
<user0> How will I know what the numbers mean ?
<user1> You can see your results and how they compare to the normal range .
<user0> How can I see test results from tests I have taken before ?
<user1> We put all of your test results up in the same place . Just check the dates for what you need .
<user1> If that's the case . there's not much point in further discussion . We might as well call the whole deal off .
<user0> What I mean is that we'll never be able to come down to your price . The gap is too great .
<user1> I think it unwise for either of us to be inflexible . How about meeting each other halfway ?
<user0> What's your proposal ?
<user1> Your unit price is 100 dollars higher than we want . Well , I suggest we meet each other halfway .
<user0> Do you mean a further reduction of 50 dollars in our price ? That's impossible !
<user1> What would you suggest ?
<user0> The best we can do is another 30 dollars off . That's definitely the lowest we can go .
<user1> That still leaves a gap of 20 dollars . Let's meet each other half-away again and split the difference ; I think this is a price we can both be satisfied with .
<user0> OK . We can meet halfway again .
<user1> Good morning , Ruth . Did I wake you up ?
<user0> No , I was just about to get up . What's up , Carl ?
<user1> Listen , I am calling to confirm what you said yesterday . Are we supposed to meet at the Chinatown terminal of the Avenue B bus or D bus ?
<user0> B as in boy . You should get off at the last stop in Chinatown .
<user1> Oh , you mean Canal Street ?
<user0> That's the wrong direction . Canal Street is on the other side of Chinatown .
<user1> Oh , I get it . When did we decide to meet ?
<user0> At 10,45 . Is Ann coming along ?
<user1> I cannot get hold of her yet .
<user0> See you around , Carl .
<user1> See you later .
<user1> Yes , we have . We've had to clean up our production process a lot to meet tough government standards .
<user0> What about your use of raw materials ?
<user1> Well , we've had to cut down the amount of solvents we use and we ' re not allowed to use lead in our products any more .
<user0> What happens if you exceed the limits ?
<user1> We try not to because you might have to pay quite a heavy fine .
<user1> That's the best there is .
<user0> Okay , I'll take one .
<user1> That'll be $ 200 , sir .
<user1> Yes , please . We're on our way out , so we put the ' make up ' sign on . Could you bring us some towels and hangers ?
<user0> No problem , sir . Everything will be ready when you come back .
<user1> External factors . I think the main external factors are political , economic , social and technological factors .
<user0> What are the internal factors that influence the company ?
<user1> The internal factors are composed of human resources , team spirit , innovation spirit and coordination between different departments , etc .
<user1> What words ? Can you tell me ?
<user0> He says kick mommy , beat mommy , don ' t want mommy , very quickly if I do something that he doesn ' t like . You know , if I wash his face or change his clothes , things like that .
<user1> Honey , I don ' t know what to tell you . Of course Tony is a young child . But do not underestimate his ability to learn and reason .
<user0> Yes , but sometimes he is just not reasonable .
<user1> I suggest you treat him with patience , affection , and respect . If he needs to do something , like go to bed , or be washed , etc . , please guide or help him to get it done , but lead him with gentleness .
<user0> It ' s easy to say , but I will try .
<user1> Motivate Tony to cooperate by rewarding his good behavior . Do not emphasize punishment for bad moods , etc . Do not threaten him with punishment if he resists the actions you desire .
<user0> I know my parents sometimes threaten to punish him . But this doesn ' t work , instead he picks up another bad habit .
<user1> Yes , I am James Mason from Anderson and Associates . I would like to see Mr . Smith .
<user0> Do you have an appointment ?
<user1> Yes , he knows I'm coming . Our meeting is set for 2 o'clock .
<user0> I wonder if Mr . Smith forgot your meeting . I am afraid he left this office this morning and is not expected back until after 4 pm . Let me find out if he made arrangements for someone else to meet with you in his place . Will you please have a seat ?
<user1> Sure .
<user0> Yes , Mr . Mason , I just checked with our office manager , Ms . Terry , she said Mr . Smith briefed her on your project . She is just finishing up a meeting now . She could be with your shortly . Would you like me to show you around while you are waiting ?
<user1> That would be very nice . Thank you .
<user0> Right this way , Mr . Mason . We can start with our front office . When Ms . Terry is ready , you may take the elevator at the front to the 6th floor . There is a conference room already prepared
<user1> no , but I heard about that Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt didn't attend .
<user0> yes , that was surprising . I heard that they got into a fight and then decided not to go .
<user1> they must be the most famous celebrity couple in Hollywood .
<user0> they're also one of the richest couples . They have so many money and they can buy almost anything they want .
<user1> I also heard that Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes made an appearance at the Oscars .
<user0> did either one of them win an Oscar this year ?
<user1> I think Tom might have been nominated for one of his films , but I don't think he won anything .
<user0> Tom Cruise may be handsome , but I think he's a bit crazy , don't you ?
<user1> yes , his marriage to Katie is actually quite scandalous .
<user0> I still think that they only got married to get more publicity for their movies and themselves .
<user1> people in show biz can have such an easy life ; I don't know why they have to make it so complicated .
<user0> I would never want to be a celebrity because the paparazzi would also be after you .
<user1> that's true . I guess it would be difficult to have people taking pictures of you everywhere you go .
<user0> thank goodness we're not rich and famous !
<user1> being famous , I can do without , but I wouldn't mind being rich .
<user1> Could I purchase Euro with RIB here ? I have to stay here for months .
<user0> Yes , the rate for cash purchases is listed on the electronica screen , so you have seen the rate of exchange .
<user1> Yes , I have known of it .
<user0> How much do you like to exchange ?
<user1> 20,000 RIB .
<user0> In what denominations ?
<user1> It doesn't matter , but leave me some small changes , that will be convenient in daily life .
<user0> Right , I will exchange for you now . Please sign the exchange form giving the name and telephone .
<user1> Well , could you change them too ? The dollars , I want to change them into Swiss francs .
<user0> OK , wait for a moment . Well , I am sorry , but we are not authorized to exchange coins because it is low and we do not have enough foreign coins . In this case , you'd better change 2,000 $ to Swiss francs .
<user1> It doesn't matter .
<user0> Please sign the memo on the bottom and keep your money and memo .
<user1> Thanks a lot . Good-bye .
<user1> We'd like to hear your account of the events of last night .
<user1> That would be nice . How are you getting there ?
<user0> Well , I prefer to go on the train , but I suppose you want me to take the car .
<user1> Oh , I much prefer to go by car , then we don't need to get to the station with our luggage and ...
<user0> And I've got to drive . You know I'm not fond of that . I found it much more relaxing to sit in the train .
<user1> Which is more expensive ?
<user0> But very much quicker . But I know we'll never agree on this subject . You prefer the car . I prefer the train .
<user1> Now , have you ever thought of going by express bus ?
<user1> What a wonderful neighborhood ! Can you find that house on our Open House list ?
<user0> Yes , that is one of the houses that we have on our list .
<user1> They always make the front yards look so great for Open Houses . Let ' s see what the inside looks like .
<user0> I am going to go sign my name in the registry to let the listing agent know that we were here .
<user1> Signing the registry is a good idea . I think I want to see the kitchen next .
<user0> I really appreciate that the listing agent provided water on such a hot day .
<user1> I need to pick up a flyer with the information about the house on it .
<user0> Is the current asking price listed on the flyer ?
<user1> The asking price has recently gone down to two hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars .
<user1> Oh , Madam , buy what ?
<user0> A new car . And I've got a small family , two children , and I haven't got a lot of money and ...
<user1> Oh , oh , Madam , Madam , I'm afraid you have the wrong number .
<user0> Isn't this the car store ?
<user1> No . It's Mike's Sporting Goods .
<user0> Oh , sorry . Do you know the number for a car store , then ?
<user1> No . I don't . I suggest you look in the phone book .
<user0> I'm sorry to have bothered you .
<user1> No problem .
<user1> That's great . What's on tonight ?
<user0> I am not sure about the name of the film , but I know it's a romantic one .
<user1> Romantic ? I am afraid I like thrillers better .
<user0> Don't you think it's too bloody ?
<user1> On the contrary , very exciting .
<user1> What day was your appointment on ?
<user0> My appointment was on Monday .
<user1> What time had you chosen ?
<user0> It was for 10
<user1> I am looking at your appointment right now . What day would you prefer ?
<user0> I would prefer next Thursday .
<user1> What time would be best for you ?
<user0> I want to come in at 2
<user1> I am writing you down for that time . We look forward to seeing you .
<user1> Hi , Robert . This is Janet Reese calling from American Advertising . We placed an order with you about a week ago .
<user0> Yes , Ms . Reese . I remember , you spoke with me . Is there a problem ?
<user1> Well , it still hasn ' t gotten here , and my boss is pretty angry about it .
<user1> Thank you . It's a pleasure to meet you .
<user0> A pleasure meeting you as well , the flowers are for you .
<user1> Thank you , they are beautiful .
<user1> That's so great !
<user0> How much are you selling it for ?
<user1> This t . v is only $ 2500 .
<user0> You can't be serious .
<user1> That's how much this t . v costs .
<user0> That's too expensive for me .
<user1> This television is of very high quality .
<user0> You can't go down on the price .
<user1> By how much ?
<user0> I'll buy it for $ 2000 .
<user1> I'm sorry , but the price is final .
<user1> Yes , I packed it myself , and it hasn ' t been out of my possession .
<user0> Are you bringing in any plants or animal products ?
<user1> No .
<user0> Our sniffer dog seems to disagree . Do you mind if we look in your suitcase ?
<user1> Not at all . Go right ahead .
<user0> What ' s this sir ?
<user1> It ' s traditional Chinese Medicine . I mix it with hot water like tea . Sorry . I forgot about it .
<user0> What are these red things sir ?
<user1> Oh no ! I forgot about those too ! Those are Chinese sausages for my Aunt Lily .
<user0> I ' m sorry sir , but you can ' t take any of this into the country . We will also have to check your carry-on . Please step this way . Don ' t ' be nervous ; we ' ll just look through it briefly and then
<user1> Hold on a second please . I'm sorry . He has gone out .
<user0> Oh.This is Paul.When will he be back ?
<user1> He will be back at about seven o'clock .
<user0> Can I leave a message please ?
<user1> Yes , certainly .
<user0> Please tell him I'll call him at the office tomorrow afternoon .
<user1> All right . I'll tell him when he comes back .
<user0> Thank you very much .
<user1> Not yet , but I'm thinking of it . Have you bought one , Dad ?
<user0> I took out a life insurance policy and made your mother the beneficiary .
<user1> Can you tell me why you want to buy it ?
<user0> I am a fireman and it is a dangerous job . I have to consider your mother's life .
<user1> Oh , I see . Do you advise me to buy one ?
<user0> You have children now . What if something , God forbid , happens to you ?
<user1> That's true . Well , how much do you think I should get ?
<user0> A $ 100 000 policy shouldn't be too expensive . Here , call my agent . He'll give you a good deal .
<user1> Yes , I do , Susan . Just a moment . Here it is .
<user0> Thank you , sir . Sorry to trouble you .
<user1> Not at all , Susan . Just tell him to leave it with my secretary when he ' s finished with it
<user1> I'm going to the hospital to see Susan .
<user0> I saw her yesterday.She was a little better .
<user1> Must I catch a number 7 bus to get there ?
<user0> No , you needn't . A number 13 bus will also take you to the hospital .
<user1> Number 13 buses run much more frequently , don't they ?
<user0> Yes . I caught a number 7 bus yesterday , and they said I had taken a wrong bus .
<user1> Thank you , Henry . I'll get a number 13 .
<user0> But number 13 buses leave from the center of town.You ' ll have to walk two miles to catch one .
<user1> Here you are .
<user0> Ah , thank you.Please bring your luggage here for inspection .
<user1> Ok.But is there anything wrong ?
<user0> It's just a regular inspection . Do you have anything to declare ?
<user1> I've got 6 packets of cigarettes and 2 bottles of champagne.Besides , I have two cameras , one is for my own use , and the other is a gift .
<user0> Well , the cigarettes and the champagne are not in excess of the duty-free allowance . But according to our law , each passenger is allowed only one camera duty-free.You ' ll have to pay duty for the other one .
<user1> Ok . Where shall I pay duty for it ?
<user0> Please wait a minute . I'll make out the duty memo ... Here you are.Take this and pay to the woman over there .
<user1> I've paid for it . Here's the receipt .
<user0> Very well . I hope you ' ll enjoy your stay in America .
<user1> Thank you .
<user1> Nice to see you , too . I heard you are a staff of Nokia company .
<user0> Yes , I ' m satisfied with this job .
<user1> Congratulations . What did you do during the interview ?
<user0> Pay more attention to the external expressions , because they are important for the first impression . Good manner and style of conversation can let other feel your good self-cultivation . Good gestures and mien can let other feel very comfortable .
<user1> How can I have the good external expressions ?
<user0> Don ' t worry about that . You just pay more attention to the details of people ' s action in life , and you will know how to transfer information by their body language .
<user1> Hello , welcome to Universal Bank . Please insert your card into the slot .
<user0> I know where to put my card ! Stupid machine , talking to me like I ' m an idiot ...
<user1> Please input your 6 digit PIN code followed by the pound key . Thank you . Please select an option.Thank you . You have selected withdrawal .
<user0> Yeah , yeah , I know what I selected . Just gimme my money !
<user1> Please type the amount you would like to withdraw . Thank you , you want to transfer 10000 USD to the World Wildlife Foundation . If this is correct please press 1 .
<user0> No , no ! Stupid machine , what are you doing ! No !
<user1> Confirmed . Thank you for using our bank ! Please remove your card from the slot . Goodbye !
<user0> No , no way ! What happened ? Give me my money !
<user1> Danger , danger ! The exits have been sealed and the doors will remain locked in until the local authorities arrive . Thank you for using our bank . Have a nice day .
<user1> I am great ! How about you , Mary ? How are you ?
<user0> I am doing great ! Thank you for asking , Joe .
<user1> I was wondering if you want to go see a movie with me tonight ?
<user0> I need to stay home tonight and finish my term paper .
<user1> OK . What about going to the movies on Friday night ?
<user0> What were you planning on seeing ?
<user1> I was thinking about seeing that one about the rapist serial killer .
<user0> How about “ The Secret Life of Bees ” ?
<user1> That's a chick flick !
<user1> First , I'd make sure that we have a good , local , corporate lawyer . He or she will know all the local laws and regulations .
<user0> That ' s very important . A friend recommended a good law firm to me . We ' ll need someone to hire staff .
<user1> I think that we should send one of our HR people to do that . I don ' t think we should use an agency , because they won ' t be familiar with the type of people we employ . Have we decide on the location of
<user0> Yes . We have . We chose the location in the northeast of the city , not too far from the airport and on the edge of the CBD .
<user1> Why didn ' t we choose an office in the CBD ?
<user0> The offices there were too expensive . Have we negotiated any contracts yet ?
<user1> Yes . We ' Ve signed two contracts with companies that we already do work for in other countries . We hope to sign another three this month .
<user0> When will the branch office open ?
<user1> Hopefully next month . Everything is a little rushed . We should be able to set up our branch office and expand our business quickly .
<user0> Has and advertising campaign been prepared ?
<user1> Yes , it has . We ' re going to target the business community through business magazines .
<user0> I made plenty of business contract on my last visit and through the embassy . We should be able to get plenty of customers .
<user1> I want to pick up my valuables .
<user0> May I have your key please ?
<user1> Sure . Here you are .
<user0> Here is your valuable . Is that right ?
<user1> Yes , thank you .
<user1> why ? I thought Americans were supposed to be more open than that .
<user0> well , for many religious people , they believe that people who abort their babies are murderers .
<user1> do you think most people in America believe that abortion is wrong ?
<user0> no , I think it's mostly the older generation who are against abortions .
<user1> it's no wonder there are so many teenage pregnancies in America .
<user0> religious people blame it on pre-marital sex , not on abortion being illegal .
<user1> what do you think about abortion ?
<user0> I personally would never want to have one , but I think that since a pregnancy can affect a woman's entire life , she should have the right to decide for herself .
<user1> do you think the fathers should have some kind of say in the matter ?
<user0> I know this is going to sound sexist , but I don't think that men should have to give their approval to the mothers of their children .
<user1> why not ? It's their children , too .
<user0> that may be true , but when a woman gets pregnant , it changes her life completely . Men can still carry on with their lives after the birth exactly as they did beforehand .
<user1> that might be true , but I think men should have some kind of say in the matter .
<user1> But I don't have any reading assignments .
<user0> Then review for your test . You'll do even better . And maybe reading will help you get to sleep .
<user1> Aw , Mom-you're such a drag .
<user0> You say that now , Lily , but you'll thank me later . I'm your mom , and mother knows best .
<user1> Sorry , we haven't made the decision at all .
<user0> Do you have any idea when you might arrive at a decision ?
<user1> We will let you know probably next Monday . I hope to give you a positive reply .
<user0> I'm willing to wait until you have come to a decision .
<user1> You can check on the bulletin boards at school for local housing .
<user0> What if I need a roommate ?
<user1> There are websites that can hook you up with a roommate .
<user0> How much do apartments cost around here ?
<user1> It depends on what you want . Do you want a one - or two-bedroom apartment ?
<user0> I just need a one-bedroom apartment .
<user1> That will probably cost you around twelve hundred dollars a month .
<user0> Would you come with me to look at apartments ?
<user1> I would be happy to look at apartments with you .
<user1> Heard what ?
<user0> Deborah already had her baby .
<user1> I didn't know that .
<user0> I thought you knew .
<user1> I honestly didn't know .
<user0> The baby was 8 pounds 6 ounces .
<user1> That's good to hear .
<user0> Will you go and visit them ?
<user1> Of course I will .
<user0> I just wanted to give you the good news .
<user1> Thanks for letting me know .
<user1> But that was the first thing that came into my mind when I heard the shout earthquake !
<user0> Why not use staircases ? The terror was not so violent at that time .
<user1> That would be too late .
<user0> Maybe the situation is too urgent .
<user1> Yes , I think I should have jumped in any case .
<user1> I know what you mean . I've started eating better myself .
<user0> What foods do you eat now ?
<user1> I tend to stick to fruits , vegetables , and chicken .
<user0> Those are the only things you eat ?
<user1> That's basically what I eat .
<user0> Why aren't you eating anything else ?
<user1> Well , fruits and vegetables are very healthy .
<user0> And the chicken ?
<user1> It's really healthy to eat when you bake it .
<user0> I guess that does sound a lot healthier .
<user1> Good morning ! Welcome to our office !
<user0> Nice to meet you ! My name is Grace Williams .
<user1> Nice to meet you too ! I am Peter Smith .
<user0> Today is my first day at work !
<user1> Well , hope you will enjoy your first day ! Just ask me if you need any help .
<user0> Thank you . It's very kind of you .
<user1> You are welcome .
<user1> Yes , I used to have a part-time job in advertising company .
<user0> What were you mean duties there ?
<user1> I mostly did advertising planning .
<user0> What qualities do you think an advertising planner should have ?
<user1> I think an advertising planner should have active thoughts , creative talent , and be sensitive to the changes in the market .
<user0> What was the most important thing you have learned at work ?
<user1> The most important thing I learned was that I must continuously improve my abilities . Advertising is a constantly evolving trade and creativity is an important fact to success . If I want to make in marking in advertising industry , I can ' t stop studying and creating .
<user1> Dan is on top of that . I think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up .
<user0> That would be convenient . They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . The circuit breakers keep going out all the time . It ' s really annoying !
<user1> Yeah you are right . This office is falling apart ! Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that ' s why the parking lot was flooded .
<user0> I know ! I was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! The handyman definitely has his work cut out for him .
<user1> No , I don't .
<user0> Shall we drop in somewhere for a couple of drinks ?
<user1> That sounds like a good idea .
<user0> I know a very interesting place .
<user1> Oh , do you ? Good .
<user1> I'd love to , the movies are smash hit .
<user0> Then let's go in .
<user1> I can't . I'm waiting for Paul , but he's late .
<user0> I'll say the movie's starting in the minute .
<user1> I know . I wonder what's keeping him .
<user0> Looks like he won't show up . He's done this before , hasn't he ?
<user1> Yeah , a number of times .
<user0> What's he trying to pull anyway .
<user1> I don't know . But this is definitely the last straw .
<user0> Maybe you should start seeing someone else .
<user1> You said it . Ok , let's go in , Sandy .

<user0> Any rain ?
<user1> No , but I wouldn't be surprised if it rained tomorrow .

<user1> Oh , yes , I am . I have always wanted to go to the States . I love meeting new people . And making new friends .
<user0> Well , I'm sure you will .
<user1> Well , there's one thing .
<user0> What's the matter
<user1> I'm a little worried about my host family . You know , in the agreement I have to do some cooking for them .
<user1> Swimming in summer and skating in winter.What ' s your favorite sport ?
<user0> Jogging and bowling . Do you know how to practise Bungfu ?
<user1> No I don't But l do Taijiquan or Shadow boxing.People everywhere in China usually do Taijiquan early in the morning.It can help people keep fit.It has a history of over three hundred years .
<user0> Is it easy to learn ?
<user1> Yes . it is I can teach you if you like .
<user0> Thank you . I can teach you how to bowl .
<user1> Right . Let's help each other .
<user1> I'm not certain . Do you know ?
<user0> America was discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1492 .
<user1> In a way that's right . But the Vikings travelled there long beforeColumbus . And what about the Red Indians ?
<user0> All right . Ask me a question now .
<user1> Who invented the electric light bulb ?
<user0> That's easy . It was invented by Edison .
<user1> Correct . Now for a harder question . Who will be the first men on Mars ?
<user0> I can't answer that . But I think Mars will be visited by men before theed of this century .
<user1> Ask me a question now .
<user0> All right . What is the nearest planet to the sun ?
<user1> That's easy . It's .. er . Venus . NO . Pluto . No . Wait a minute . It's Anthe tip of my tongue . Oh dear , what is the nearest planet to the sun ?
<user1> You bought a compact car ?
<user0> No , I borrowed it .
<user1> Let me guess , from Sarah . It looks like something she would drive .
<user0> You guessed right . Besides , the color violet is a little girly for me .
<user1> I love it . It's so festive ! And where did you get that cup ? It's got the same logo .
<user1> Terrible ! Does he want to divorce ?
<user0> I am not sure .
<user1> Don ' t lose your reason . Go to find him and talk with him .
<user1> You have much patience .
<user0> Wow ! Your calligraphy is very beautiful . It was worth the wait !
<user1> Thank you . Today I'm writing a kind of poem called a Chinese couplet .
<user0> What does it say ?
<user1> This is an especially famous one . It says " May the passing days bring you health and longevity . May this season of renewal find you basked in riches . "
<user0> That's very nice . Is it for sale ?
<user1> No . I never sell my artwork .
<user0> Really ? Then what do you do with it ?
<user1> I give it away . Here , this one is for you .
<user0> Wow ! Really ? Are you sure ? Now I'll have a lucky year !
<user1> Remember , real luck must be created ( by ) yourself , and then it cannot be given or taken away ...
<user1> Very romantic ?
<user0> Yeah . He always tickled my finny bone with his college stories .
<user1> You married him for that reason ?
<user0> Definitely not . The most important thing was we loved each other .
<user1> Yeah , some places are very short of water .
<user0> Because of pollution and other things , our environment has become worse and worse .
<user1> You see , This time I traveled to the West . When I looked out of the windows of the rain , all the lands that I could see are as dry as a bone .
<user0> It is serious .
<user1> Me too .
<user1> She does have a heart of gold .
<user0> You can say that again .
<user1> You don't really believe in all that hocus pocus mumbo jumbo , do you ?
<user0> Well , I have had many friends that went to a psychic and got their palms read and most of the things the psychic told her came true !
<user1> Of course it does ! They tell you general and obvious things like that you will be successful or have a big house . I think most of the times they are just scam artists .
<user0> Well , historically it is a practice that many cultures share . Reading the tarot cards , in the east they would even read tea leaves ! I even heard that there are people that make you smoke a cigar , and then read your ashes .
<user1> All superstitious nonsense ! I would still like to go to one and see what he or she has to say , just for kicks .
<user1> Yes , I'd like a book about law .
<user0> Would you tell me the name of the book and the author ?
<user1> Uh , the Origin of Law . And it's written by Professor Felix of Harvard .
<user0> I'm sorry . It's out of stock now . Could you come by again next week ?
<user1> Next week ? It is too late . I need it urgently .
<user0> Well , then , is it convenient to leave your phone number so that I can inform you as soon as we restock it ?
<user1> No , thanks any way .
<user0> You're welcome .
<user1> Anne ! I haven't seen you for ages.How ' Ve you been ?
<user0> Fine , just fine.And you ?
<user1> Not bad.It really is great to see you again.Where have you been ?
<user0> Guangzhou . I've got a cousin there .
<user1> What's up , Robert ?
<user0> Cafe au lait , cafe latte , cappuccino , cafe mocha ... I can't keep them all straight !
<user1> Slow down . What are you talking about ?
<user0> It's about a girl . No , an angel ! I'm going to the coffee shop where she works right now .
<user1> Yes , may I help you ?
<user0> We have just arrived from Tokyo only ... looking for a reserve car of your company . All of above , we cannot find it .
<user1> What is your reservation number ?
<user0> Our reservation number is J - 221 .
<user1> Let me see . Oh , yes , we have your reservation number .
<user0> You mean you haven ' t arranged any car ?
<user1> I ' m sorry to say no .
<user0> Here I ' ll take taxi instead , how do you refund us ?
<user1> I don't know . It's a rental .
<user0> I will give you premium unleaded . Alright ?
<user1> Sure , why not ?
<user0> That is the pump you are in front of .
<user1> Is it expensive ?
<user0> It is the most expensive .
<user1> Well , I don't want it then . Can I move to another pump ?
<user0> Yes , I can give you regular unleaded . But you have to back up the car a little .
<user1> Give me regular unleaded then . I will back up.Can you wash my windows for me ?
<user0> I'm sorry , sir . This is not a full service gas station . I will help you fill the gas , but we don't wash windows here .
<user1> Really ? Well , I guess I have to get used to it .
<user1> Josh and I were just on our way back home from the beach and thought we'd drop by .
<user0> I am so glad that you decided to stop by !
<user1> Yes , it has been a long time since we have seen you .
<user0> Mary , can I get Josh or you something to drink ?
<user1> Oh no , thank you . We aren't all that thirsty .
<user0> How about a little snack then ?
<user1> No , thank you , we just ate lunch a little while ago .
<user0> Well then , how is your family ?
<user1> Everyone is doing great . My sister finally had her baby .
<user1> Each ring has 3 small diamonds inside the band .
<user0> Oooh ! One for each of the zeros in 2000 ! Wow !
<user1> Stop making fun of me .
<user0> So find a guy to marry and you can get one !
<user1> I don't need a guy to buy a wedding ring !
<user0> Oh , I see . You're going to wear one and pretend you're married to try to attract guys .
<user1> Congratulation . What will you do ?
<user0> They got me a part-time tutoring job , teaching an Australian businessman Chinese .
<user1> That's wonderful . I want to get a part-time job too . Tell me what I should do .
<user0> It's very simple actually . You can go to the service centre and have your name and job interest resisted . They will give you a call if any job comes up .
<user1> Good . I'll do it .
<user1> Only once or twice at the most .
<user0> Do you know why ?
<user1> I have no idea .
<user1> You can have a bird view of Guiling City from the top of the mountain .
<user0> Wonderful ! I'll often come here for mountain climbing .
<user1> You should . Many Guiliners , especially the old and the young , will climb mountains here in the morning .
<user0> No wonder people say
<user1> Quick ! Pass me your binoculars . Look at that bird ... I've never seen one of those before . It's indigenous to Guiling , and an endangered species too . This is lucky !
<user0> I didn't know you liked bird-watching .
<user1> I don't really . I just like wildlife , and you don't get to see too much of it in the city . This place is full of it .
<user1> Aw , that's sweet ! I knew your costume would be a success .
<user0> It's a success all right . The kids keep trying to catch me .
<user1> Yeah , I saw that . I thought you were playing a game with them .
<user0> Some game ! You try being tackled by ten kids at once !
<user1> Um , Holly ? Look behind you . They're coming this way .
<user1> of course I'd come . I couldn't think of a better chance to see all my old friends .
<user0> yeah . It's hard to believe that it's been ten years since graduation . It feels just yesterday we collected our diplomas .
<user1> how time flies . But hey , how are things going with you ?
<user0> oh , where to start ? There have been ups and downs . I'm still trying to find my place in this world . It's only recently that I've been able to start settling down . How about you ? You still with Jenn
<user1> yeah , Jenny and I got married right after graduation . It was tough the first years trying to make ends meet . I was supporting us both while she continued her studies . But now things are getting better
<user0> oh , that sounds wonderful . I have always known you two would make it . I hope I can keep in better contact with you guys . I don't want us to drift apart again .
<user1> definitely ! Actually , we just moved into a new place . There's a house-warming party this Saturday , if you are free ? I know Jenny would love to see you again and it should be a good party .
<user0> sounds great ! I'll be there .
<user1> and what if it doesn't work out , right ?
<user0> Exactly .
<user1> You need to quit thinking like a loser . invoking is going to kick butt . You know how I know ?
<user0> How ?
<user1> Because I won't let it fail .
<user0> But what about tomorrow ? What if Stars.com decides to go with WebTracker , and not us ?
<user1> All set . I've got my makeup , my Cds , and my portable TV set ...
<user0> Hello ! We're supposed to be getting back to nature .
<user1> Yeah , yeah . Anyway ... I'm packed . Are you ?
<user0> I've been packed for a week . All my stuff is in this backpack .
<user1> Let me see ... two books ... birdseed ?
<user0> That's trail mix !
<user1> Same difference . What's this ?
<user1> I hope we'll get together again soon .
<user0> I hope so . A good journey to you !
<user1> Thank you .
<user1> Why do you say so ? Everyone admires that you have a good wife .
<user0> Oh , no . When we were poor , we often tried our best to make ends meet . It was a hard time .
<user1> But now you are rich .
<user0> And we have some squabbles on some boring things .
<user1> This is ordinary marriage life .
<user1> Don ' t be kidding , OK ?
<user0> What ' s the matter ? So angry . I ' m just playing a joke with you .
<user1> Because I have given him up as a bad job . Our relation has been over .
<user1> Yes , I think so , If you want to graduated this year , you've got to take a science course .
<user0> Right , I figure since you are doing premedical , you know about the very courses .
<user1> Well , I have to take biology , chemistry , maps and physics.what you need is a good introductory course for non-science majors .
<user0> Yes , I really weak in maps , I did poorly in high school .
<user1> That's a problem .
<user1> It's Beethoven . Do you like it ?
<user0> I think Beethoven's music is incredible . I've heard that listening to it can make you more intelligent , too . Do you believe that ?
<user1> I don't know about that , but I do think that it helps people relax .
<user0> What other kind of music do you listen to ?
<user1> Actually , I mostly just listen classical music . What about you ?
<user0> To be honest , I think classical music is too complicated for me .
<user1> What kind of music do you prefer then ?
<user0> I like pop music . Do you ?
<user1> Not really . I don't think pop music has much depth .
<user0> I see what you mean . I think that's way I like it so much .
<user1> How long have you been in to pop music , then ?
<user0> I've always been into it . Have you always liked classical music ?
<user1> Not really . When I was little , we didn't really listen to music at all .
<user0> So , how did you become interested in it ?
<user1> Well , when I was about 10 years old , I started playing the piano . I think that's how it all started .
<user0> Do you still play piano ?
<user1> Yes , it's one of my hobbies .
<user1> Not good . My cousin is driving me up the wall .
<user0> How so ?
<user1> He stays up untill all hours of the night , and he never lifts a finger to help .
<user0> Have you talk to him about it ?
<user1> Not yet , but I have to soon . He's eating me out of house and home . I caught him reading the fridge again last night
<user0> Ahahah , Maybe that will help you lose weight .
<user1> This is no laughing matter , Nick .
<user0> Sorry Paul . I couldn't help it . So why doesn't he give you a hand ?
<user1> He watch the tob too much . Now really I don't know . But I can't handle this much longer .
<user0> Well , talk to him , and let me know what happens , OK ?
<user1> Yes , that's right .
<user0> What do you suggest I should see in New York ?
<user1> Well , how about the Museum of Modern Art ?
<user0> No , I don't like museums . They're boring .
<user1> Why don't you go to see the Empire State Building ?
<user0> Ah ! That sounds interesting .
<user1> It's Gone With the Wind .
<user0> Why do you like it best ?
<user1> I enjoy the various characters and the plot .
<user0> Well . I like the Thom Birds best .
<user1> Is it very interesting ?
<user0> Sure . I like the writer's language , too .
<user1> If I have a chance , I'll enjoy the book .
<user0> Would you like to go to the bookshop with me ?
<user1> That's a good idea . Let's go !
<user1> Cool , fellow , what's the date today , buddy ?
<user0> It's ... oh it's the 1st April , April Fool's Day .
<user1> You forgot all of about it , didn't you ?
<user1> How can you be so sure ?
<user0> He knows a lot about law and he ' s eloquent , too .
<user1> Yes . Are you going to be taking a class from him ?
<user0> Yes , but I have never taken his class before .
<user1> He is very interesting and challenging . Is that what you are looking for ?
<user0> Yes , that's what I need .
<user1> He is really clear on what you need to learn to get a good grade . Are you willing to study hard ?
<user0> Yes , I guess so .
<user1> What I really liked about him is that he was an understanding and friendly teacher . Do you enjoy that in a teacher ?
<user0> Yes , I had a teacher like that before .
<user1> Did you know that he has 20 years teaching experience ?
<user0> No , I didn't , but that could be a good thing .
<user1> Well , take a look at everything and figure out what is best for you . Good luck !
<user1> I'm not feeling well . I'm very nervous .
<user0> Take it easy . We are going to have our own baby . You should be happy .
<user1> Yeah , I know .
<user0> The doctors and the nurses will help you . And I will be waiting for you right here , praying for you and our baby .
<user1> Thank you , dear . I feel better now .
<user1> Yeah . It's been raining a lot these days .
<user0> I have been watching a lot of videos at home because of the constant rain .
<user1> Have you heard when it's supposed to get better ?
<user0> I saw the weather report , and it's going to rain for the next eight days .
<user1> That sucks so much . What are we going to do ?
<user0> I'm getting pretty bored . We should do something despite the rain .
<user1> I'm with you . What do you have in mind ?
<user0> I haven't been to the Mall in a long time . Let's go there .
<user1> That sounds good . They have a movie theatre there , so if we get bored , we can watch a movie .
<user0> Great . I'll stop by your place now .
<user1> Ok . Don't forget to bring your umbrella . The rain can start up again anytime .
<user1> Professor Donald , are you giving your advanced geology course again next semester ?
<user0> Yes , I am applying on it .
<user1> I wonder if I could enroll in it . I know it is a graduate course and I ' m a junior , but ...
<user0> Aren't you a bit young ? I have a lot of qualified seniors to take the course and they usually have a hard time keeping up .
<user1> I know , but geology of the American west is my major interest and I have done a large reading in the field .
<user0> Well , if you think you are ready , I'll let you enroll .
<user1> Oh , thanks , professor Donald . This is really very nice of you .
<user1> Come on , don ' t be so dramatic ! I ' m sure everything is going to work out just fine .
<user0> You think so ? Oh , no ! How can he do this to me ? I ' m sure he ' s cheating on me ! Why else wouldn ' t he call ?
<user1> But , you two are on a break . Theoretically he can do whatever he likes .
<user0> He ' s the love of my life ! I ' Ve really messed this up .
<user1> Come on , hon . Pull yourself together . It ' s going to be alright .
<user0> But I ... I still love him ! And it ' s all my fault ! I can ' t believe how immature and selfish I was being . I mean , he is a firefighter , it ' s not like he can just leave someone in a burning building and meet me for dinner . I ' Ve totally messed this up !
<user1> You know what , Veronica , I think you should make the first step . I ' m sure he ' ll forgive you ...
<user0> No , this is not gonna happen ! I ... I ' Ve ruined everything ...
<user1> do you hear something ?
<user1> to be honest , I was just dumped .
<user0> oh , I'm sorry to hear that . You can go on a holiday to cheer you up .
<user1> no , thanks . I'm not in the mood for traveling .
<user0> come on . A trip will do you good . Are you doing anything this weekend ?
<user1> I was planning on doing a lot of wallowing .
<user0> well , my friends and I are planning on going to Shangri-La on Saturday . Do you want to come with us ?
<user1> where is that ?
<user0> not very far from here . We'll fly . It's about one and a half hours .
<user1> what's there to see ?
<user0> there is a large canyon , vast grasslands , ancient forests and mountain lakes .
<user1> oh , sounds nice .
<user0> yes , the scenery there is breathtaking . I have some pictures at home . You can come over and take a look if you like .
<user1> ok . Then I can make up my mind .
<user1> Yes , just once .
<user0> What was the reason ?
<user1> I once played truant when I was in college because I intended to organize a donation activity for the disaster-hit areas in Sichuan .
<user1> Oh , I can't . I have a date !
<user0> Really ? Wow with who ?
<user1> This girl I've been chatting with for the past couple of months . She's really cool and she's driving over here this weekend .
<user0> Wait a minute , you mean you met her online ?
<user1> Yeah ! I signed up for a website called match @ . com and it is great ! You fill in all your details and preferences , like if you are a smoker or if you have any pets . Then you find people that have similar characteristics and you can email them or chat .
<user0> That is kind of weird ! What if she is a psycho or something like that ?
<user1> It's the same as meeting people anywhere and dating them ! I am just tired of going to bars or being set up for dates by my friends ! I think this is a really cool alternative , especially if you are a bit shy .
<user0> I guess it does seem logical . I'll have to check it out !
<user1> Stay for dinner with us .
<user0> I'm afraid I can't . I have a dinner party at seven tonight . You see , I am going to England the day after tomorrow .
<user1> Well , I won't keep you then . It was very nice of you to come to see me .
<user0> It has been a pleasure . Goodbye .
<user1> Goodbye . Thank you again for coming .
<user1> Sure ! Are you okay ? You seem a bit worried.What ' s on your mind ?
<user0> We need to talk .
<user1> Okay ...
<user0> I ' Ve been thinking , and well , I think we need to start seeing other people .
<user1> What ? Why ? I mean , we ' Ve had our ups and downs , and we have the occasional disagreement , but we ' re happy together , aren ' t we ?
<user0> That ' s just it , I ' m not happy anymore , Tim . It ' s not you , it ' s me . I know that I can be hard to deal with , and you are a great guy ! You are the type of guy that any woman would kill for !
<user1> So , what are you saying ? You ' re breaking up with me because I ' m perfect ?
<user0> Tim , you are too good for me . You deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . Oh , I could say that I ' ll be all you need , but that would be a lie . I know I ' d only hurt you , I know I ' d only make you cry .
<user1> Baby , come on . Don ' t do this to me ! Whatever it is , we can work it out . Just give me another chance ! I know that we can get through this , but we gotta stick together ! Don ' t leave me .
<user0> I can ' t , Tim . I hope someday you can find some way to understand I ' m only doing this for you . I don ' t really wanna go but , deep in my heart I know this is the kindest thing to do .
<user1> Laura ...
<user0> Here are your keys . I ' ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week . I ' m sorry , Tim . I wish you all the best , and I hope that one day we can meet again . I ' ll always love you . Goodbye .
<user1> What's wrong , honey ? Take it easy .
<user0> I am tired of doing that boring work . I just repeat doing counting everyday . It's so terrible .
<user1> Me too . But I think we can do something else for a change .
<user0> You know I work with my professional knowledge not passion . Sometimes I don't know what the meaning of working is ?
<user1> But you did a good job . You always perform the best in our company .
<user0> Yes , that's in the past . Maybe I need to go to my psychologist for help .
<user1> Perhaps you've just tired and you need a vacation .
<user0> I was full of ambitions before . But now I have no aim for my career .
<user1> Maybe we should keep on studying to enrich our knowledge and make our life exciting .
<user0> That sounds interesting . But I don't know how to do that .
<user1> How about a training course ?
<user0> A training course ? That must be costly .
<user1> But it's worth it . Maybe it can get us into a good mood and also helps us learn something to use for the future .
<user0> OK , let's have a try .
<user1> OK .
<user1> Oh , yes . You ?
<user0> Yes . What did you think of it ?
<user1> I thought it was better than the others-I really liked it . What did you think of it ?
<user0> Yes , I liked it , too . It was exciting , but not over the top . Do you know what I mean ?
<user1> Mmm . That's what I thought too . I really liked the car chase , and the opening credit sequence was very exciting . And I always enjoy watching Pierce Brosnan .
<user0> Oh , yes . He's brilliant . Did you like the title song ?
<user1> Not as much as last time , actually . What's the name of the American actor who was in the supporting role ?
<user0> Hum , Edward Norton , or something like that . Did you like him ?
<user1> Yes . He was excellent . They worked well together , don't you think ?
<user0> I don't know . I think the woman was better . She provided a good love interest . Lucky James Bond !
<user1> Yes !
<user1> What's her figure ?
<user0> Perfect , and I like her charming eyes too .
<user1> What's the color of her eyes ?
<user0> Dark blue .
<user1> I'm going to buy a CD .
<user0> Why not listen to music online ?
<user1> Then I will have to pay quite a lot to listen to music on line , isn't it ?
<user0> You can audition music on line , and you can audition it off line after downloading it , so you needn't pay for it .
<user1> I have downloaded one , but it still can't be listened .
<user0> In order to listen to music , you must have the necessary software .
<user1> Can you recommend some to me ?
<user0> Certainly . Realplayer is a good .
<user1> Can I download it ?
<user0> Yes , but you need install it after downloading so that you can use it .
<user1> I'll try it tonight .
<user1> Yeah , Richard said something to me that I didn't appreciate .
<user0> Oh , no . I know how insensitive he can be . What has he done now ?
<user1> He asked me how long it took me to learn English .
<user0> But , you were born and raised in California !
<user1> Yeah , but I get that sometimes . It doesn't matter how many generations my family has lived in the U . S . , we'll always be foreigners in their eyes .
<user0> What a racist ! How can you stand working with the guy ?
<user1> You know , Richard isn't such a bad guy . He made the comment out of ignorance , not malice .
<user0> So , what did you say when he asked you how long it took you to learn English ?
<user1> I told him 28 years . And , he knows I'm 28 years old since I just celebrated my birthday last week . He was puzzled for a minute , and then he got it .
<user0> Are you sure he really got the message ?
<user1> Yeah , I'm pretty sure since I then asked him how long it took him to learn English .
<user0> That's hilarious ! What did he say ?
<user1> He said , ' 36 years , ' and we both laughed about it . He apologized and now , it's all good .
<user0> I'm glad . I bet he won't make that mistake again .
<user1> Yes , it's a way to commemorate a great ancient romantic poet , and the race is a symbol of the attempt to save him .
<user0> I see.Did they succeed in the end ?
<user1> Of course not.He drowned .
<user1> I would like to use a computer .
<user0> Do you have your library card ?
<user1> I sure do .
<user0> There is a wait for the computers .
<user1> That ' s all right .
<user0> You need to print your name on this list .
<user1> Okay . Now what ?
<user0> Once a computer is available , I will let you know .
<user1> How am I supposed to log on to the computer ?
<user0> All you do is type in the number on the back of your card .
<user1> That ' s it ? Thank you very much .
<user1> to be honest , I'm really fed up with work at the moment . I need a break !
<user0> are you doing anything this weekend ?
<user1> I have to work on Saturday all day ! I really hate my job !
<user0> are you available on Sunday ?
<user1> yes , that's my only day off until Thursday .
<user0> ok , well , my friends and I are planning on going to the beach on Sunday . We tend to leave around noon whenever we go anywhere , so you could still sleep in . Do you want to come with us ?
<user1> that'd be fantastic ! Which beach are you going to ?
<user0> it's a quiet beach just about an hour outside of the city .
<user1> what should I bring with me ?
<user0> we've got plenty of inflatables , but if you want to sit on a chair , you'll have to bring your own sunlounger .
<user1> I can just use my beach towel . I love lazing around in the sun .
<user0> do you like surfing ?
<user1> I've actually never tired . Do you have a surfboard ?
<user0> we've got a few . I can teach you how to surf on Sunday . It'll be fun !
<user1> I can't wait ! It sounds like we're going to have a great time . How much money should I bring ?
<user0> you'll just need roughly $ 10 for food and gas money . My friend is driving , so we usually all chip in a few dollars for gas money .
<user1> ok , where and when should I meet you ?
<user0> we'll pick you up at your place at noon . Be there or be square !
<user1> It'll take us all some time to get used to the change .
<user1> Why do you say that ? I think you're making a lot of progress .
<user0> No , I'm not . I try and try and I still can't speak it very well .
<user1> Learning any language takes a lot of effort.But don't give up . Why don't we practise those dialogues together ?
<user0> Good idea . That might help .
<user1> You are interested in other people ' s business , aren ' t you ?
<user0> Does he mean I am inquisitive or I ' m noisy ?
<user1> Yes .
<user1> OK , please .
<user0> My wife wants to take the children to go shopping , where is the best place to go ?
<user1> I would recommend the mall , it's about 20 minutes , drive to the south in a taxi . It has a wide range of shops and restaurants .
<user0> Thank you . Also , we'd like to do some sightseeing while we're in town . Can you recommend some local attractions ?
<user1> How old are your children ?
<user0> I have a 10 - year-old boy and a 6 - year-old girl .
<user1> I would recommend a day at the zoo . It's fun for all the family . There is also a water park just outside the city if you would like a day trip .
<user0> It sounds marvelous . Thank you for your help .
<user1> Easter's a good day for reunions . The family goes to church together .
<user0> And after church they come here for lunch ?
<user1> Yup , a big potluck buffet . And then-notice there are no children around ?
<user0> Yeah , what's up with that ?
<user1> The kids wait in the house while the grownups hide these . Hide away , Yi-jun !
<user1> Well , I've been looking forward to seeing you .
<user0> What can I get you ?
<user1> I'd love a gin and tonic .
<user1> Sure , what's the author's name , please .
<user0> I can't remember that clearly . It probably be Charles ...
<user1> Charles Dickens ?
<user0> No , no , no . I'm not interested in literature .
<user1> OK , do you know the title of the book ?
<user0> Oh , sorry . I'm always absent-minded . I remember that I've put a note in my pocket .
<user1> So , show me the note please .
<user0> I can't find it now .
<user1> Oh , such bad luck , sir . Can you please name the category of the book ?
<user0> Let me see . It's not fiction . It's biography .
<user1> OK , I'll search it for you . A moment , please .
<user0> Thanks .
<user1> I look at many things , attendance , quizzes , and tests .
<user0> What is the most important factor ?
<user1> Obviously I look for improvement as we go along , but I would like you to do your best from the beginning .
<user0> How can we keep track of our grades ?
<user1> The final and midterm are 40 percent of your grade ; homework , attendance , and quizzes total 60 percent .
<user0> What if we can't get to school ?
<user1> You can only miss one class without penalty .
<user0> If we have a major problem , will you let us know ?
<user1> I will be letting you know during the year if you have a major problem .
<user1> Have you thought about the cost ?
<user0> There is that .
<user1> I believe it'll be very expensive .
<user1> I would like to return some books .
<user0> I ' ll take them .
<user1> Here you go .
<user0> These books were due two weeks ago .
<user1> Yeah . I totally forgot they were due .
<user0> You will need to pay late fees on these books .
<user1> How much are the late fees ?
<user0> The fee is 25 cents every day .
<user1> I have to pay 25 cents a day ?
<user0> And that ' s for each book that is late .
<user1> That shouldn ' t be a problem .
<user1> It sure is ! The water looks so nice ! Anchor the boat for a little while . I ' m going to take a dip .
<user0> Why are you doggy-paddling ? I taught you how to swim ! Do your breast stroke !
<user1> I get too tired ! I ' ll just backstroke , it ' s easier !
<user0> Try kicking your legs more . That ' s good . Don ' t go out too far !
<user1> It ' s fine . Jump in !
<user0> Kathy ! Get back here ! I see a shark !
<user1> Ahahah ! ! ! Help me ! Help ! Bring the boat closer ! The shark is coming straight towards me !
<user0> It ' s right under you ! Kathy ! ! !
<user1> my husband and I got married in a registry office with just two friends there as witnesses . But then we had three parties to celebrate .
<user0> three parties ? That's quite a lot . That must have been expensive !
<user1> well , since my husband and I are from two different countries , and we live in a third country , we decided to have one in each country . It wasn't actually that expensive .
<user0> were your parents upset that they weren't there to see you get married ?
<user1> I would have liked them to be there , but they couldn ' t afford to fly out to see us , and we couldn't afford to fly out to see them , so they understood .
<user0> did your husband's family get to meet your family ?
<user1> my husband's parents flew out to meet my family when we got married in my hometown , so that was great . Some people spend ridiculous amounts of money on extravagant wedding receptions , but we agreed t
<user0> that makes sense . Did you go on a honeymoon ?
<user1> we waited until our one-year anniversary to go on our honeymoon to Africa .
<user0> you really didn't have a very traditional wedding , did you ?
<user1> not at all , but we don ' t have a very traditional marriage either , so it suited us perfectly !
<user1> I'd love to , the movies are smash hit .
<user0> Then let's go in .
<user1> I can't . I'm waiting for Paul , but he's late .
<user0> I'll say the movie's starting in the minute .
<user1> I know . I wonder what's keeping him .
<user0> Looks like he won't show up . He's done this before , hasn't he ?
<user1> Yeah , a number of times .
<user0> What's he trying to pull anyway .
<user1> I don't know . But this is definitely the last straw .
<user0> Maybe you should start seeing someone else .
<user1> You said it . Ok , let's go in , Sandy .
<user1> I ' m going to visit my brother . he ' s just had a baby . He lives in Minneapolis .
<user0> And how long do you you plan to remain in the United States ?
<user1> I ' ll be here for approximately three weeks . See , here ' s my return ticket for the twenty-sixth of March .
<user0> And , who is sponsoring your trip ?
<user1> My brother , here , this is an invitation letter from him . I will stay with him and his family in their home .
<user0> Alright , tell me about the ties you have to your home country .
<user1> Well , I own a house . actually , I ' m leaving my dog there with my neighbors . I have a car at home , and oh , my job ! I ' m employed by Tornal as an engineer . Actually , I only have three weeks ' vacation , so I have to go back to work at the end of March .
<user0> And what evidence do you have that you are financially independent ?
<user1> Well , I do have assets in my country . like I said , I own a house , and see , here ' s a bank statement showing my investments , and my bank balance .
<user0> I ' m sorry , sir , we cannot grant you a B2 visa at this time , instead , you are granted a resident visa ! Congratulations , you are the millionth person to apply for a visa ! You win ! Congratulations !
<user1> Well , I am a bit out of shape . I'm thinking about getting some exercises to keep fit .
<user0> Oh , that's good news for us .
<user1> So what do you provide ?
<user0> First of all , we'll design a custom-made work-out plan according to your habits .
<user1> How can you get that done ?
<user0> Well , we give each of our customers a personal trainer who is qualified . And he will give you a fitness assessment and then come up with the work-out plan for your needs .
<user1> What else ?
<user0> Since everyone is different , your personal trainer will find you a suitable type of exercise equipment and teach you all the techniques to help you achieve your fitness level and goal .
<user1> Sounds pretty good . What about the charge ?
<user0> That depends . We offer membership for one month , half a year and one year .
<user1> Maybe one month . Just have a try first . Not too tough at the beginning .
<user0> Wise decision . You'll find it's totally worth it .
<user1> Not really . I could take it or leave it .
<user0> Not me . I have to have my TV and watch whatever comes on .
<user1> How can you do that ?
<user1> My name is Jung Min . What's your name ?
<user0> My name is Jessica . It's nice to meet you .
<user1> Yes . It's nice to meet you too . Are you a new student too ?
<user0> No . I'm a sophomore . I take it you are a new student ?
<user1> Yeah . It's pretty exciting to be here .
<user0> Have fun while it lasts . The excitement wears off real quick . Especially after you see how much homework you get . Where are you from ?
<user1> I'm from Korea . My parents wanted me to go to an American university , so I came here .
<user0> I have never been to Korea . I've been to Japan before , but never Korea .
<user1> Why were you in Japan ?
<user0> My father thought it would be a good experience to take a vacation to a different country . He's so into learning about different cultures .
<user1> That's pretty cool .
<user0> I thought it would have been more fun if I went without my parents .
<user1> Well , if you ever want to visit Korea , I would be happy to show you around .
<user0> Thanks for the offer . I'll keep that in mind . Oh , the professor is coming . We'll talk more after class .
<user1> Ok .
<user1> Who ?
<user0> John Smith , the escaped criminal .
<user1> That bad egg , who took the low road since he was a boy .
<user0> I think I must report to the cops .
<user1> Ok .
<user1> Eh , so so .
<user0> And this one ? Too flashy ?
<user1> Nah , not too flashy .
<user0> Hug ! And this sweater from my aunt ? Isn ' t it hideous ?
<user1> I guess .
<user0> Are you even listening ? I ' m trying to have a conversation with you .
<user1> And I ' m trying to watch the game , but you ' re yapping on about your new clothes !
<user0> Well I have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when I go to the Boxing Day sales this afternoon !
<user1> Well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? It ' s the third quarter and you ' Ve been blabbering on since the first !
<user0> Oh , your precious game . You watch the same game every year , and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals !
<user1> Oh no you didn ' t . You didn ' t just insult the Sals-bury Seals , did you ? Why don ' t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
<user0> I might just ! Enjoy your stupid game !
<user1> Yes , fine . I had something wrong with my stomach . I won ' t go into detail , but it wasn ' t serious .
<user0> I really dislike going to a doctor or to a hospital .
<user1> I think most people are a little nervous about it . I was really very , very nervous just before I had the operation , but the anaesthetist gave me an anaesthetic and the next thing I remember was waking up after the operation .
<user0> It must have really hurt afterwards .
<user1> Well , the nurse game me plenty of painkillers , but it did feel uncomfortable . I wasn ' t permitted to eat anything for 48 hours . That was the worse thing .
<user0> I bet you were ready for a thick juicy steak when you got out of hospital .
<user1> I certainly was ! However , the doctor gave me a list of food I couldn ' t eat for another 72 hours , and steak was on the list !
<user0> Is there any pain now ?
<user1> No , not at all . I stopped taking painkillers after a couple of days .
<user0> Did they take good care of you in the hospital ?
<user1> Oh , yes . The nurse were very kind , though they were strict about what I could drink . In the end , I just drank water and nothing else . Everyone was very professional and I actually enjoyed some aspects of my stay .
<user1> I had a fantastic time .
<user1> Everything goes well , but I am thinking about quitting my current job .
<user0> Why ? You ' re not satisfied anymore ?
<user1> I just sense . But I cannot grow anymore . My boss is not really supporting me . I am interested in some positions in other JV companies , but I need to do some more in-depth research before I send my application letters out .
<user0> That is important . Doing research on a company you are interested in will definitely help your application .
<user1> Certainly , it is very nice talking with you . But I really have to go now . Catch you later .
<user0> Ok , good luck to you .
<user1> Yeah . But he soon feel regretted for it .
<user0> But he seems to be very happy with Rose .
<user1> He is more nice than wise .
<user1> Yes , is that you , Allen ?
<user0> Yes , how are you doing ?
<user1> Not bad .
<user0> Say I've got two tickets for the concert this evening.Would you like to come with me ?
<user1> Sure.Thank you very much .
<user0> Then I ' ll pick you up at six thirty.OK ?
<user1> Ok , see you .
<user0> See you .
<user1> Yeah , I'm worried . If it's like this tomorrow , our big outdoor party will have to be canceled .
<user0> Let's hope it clears up .
<user1> Yeah , I'm afraid so .
<user0> If there's one thing that bugs me , it's her critical attitude .
<user1> Yes , it is annoying .
<user1> Nothing particular . But , ...
<user0> What's the matter ?
<user1> I , I don't know how to explain it to you .
<user0> Go ahead . It's nothing serious . We are good friends , aren't we ?
<user1> Yes , of course . But I'm afraid I can't tell you .
<user1> How do you do ? Nice to meet you , Ms . Smith . I ' m Jack Stevens from the Marketing Department . Here is my card .
<user0> It ' s nice to meet you , Mr . Stevens .
<user1> Please call me Jack . Have a seat , please .
<user0> Thank you .
<user1> You're welcome .
<user1> That's all right .
<user1> Not much . Just sitting here eating some Chinese food . Is that the paper ? Why don't you open it and tell me my horoscope ?
<user0> Ok , wait a minute ... let's see . I'm a Taurus , and it says , Mars is in the third house , and is soon to eclipse Venus . I don't know what that means , but then it says , Your charm and drive will win others over to your way of thinking . Remember to be positive . Sounds good to me .
<user1> What about Gemini ? What's the prediction ?
<user0> Since Mercury has crossed paths with Jupiter , your fortunes are falling . Bad luck will follow you today , and you will lose that which you value . Be careful .
<user1> That sounds bad ! I'm really worried , what should I do ? Maybe I should go home and stay in the rest of the day .
<user0> But we have a date tonight ! You can't stay at home because of a stupid horoscope .
<user1> That sounds great . Where are you going ?
<user0> I think we can go to the river , go around and have supper .
<user1> What should I bring ?
<user0> Nothing . Just wear comfortable clothes and good shoes for walking . We'll bring everything .
<user1> I feel confident of his ability to cure my daughter's disease .
<user0> How can you be so sure ?
<user1> I can tell form the way he spoke to us .
<user0> Never believe his words .
<user1> I guess we should invite him . I just hope he doesn't start talking about Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger again .
<user0> Oh , come on ! The game is better with three people . Anyway , if we don't ask him to play , he'll be mad .
<user1> Yeah , you're right . We'll never hear the end of it .
<user1> Personally , I'm not for it . I feel it's bad for kids to watch .
<user0> But kids like watching things like that . It's just for fun , would't you say ?
<user1> If you ask me , I have to disagree . Something shouldn't be watched for fun .
<user1> Yes , I am .
<user0> Shall we have dinner together ?
<user1> Do you have a special restaurant in mind ?
<user0> Yes , I do . I know a place that has excellent food .
<user1> OK . I'll be happy to join you .
<user1> The board has been considering introducing flex time .
<user0> Good news . Ah , what if be even better if alternative work place is provided .
<user1> Then our entire job could be done by telecommuting .
<user1> Yes .
<user0> Where did you learn ?
<user1> I learned in college .
<user0> You speak really well .
<user1> Thank you .
<user0> How long have you been in the U . S . ?
<user1> 3 weeks .
<user0> Is your wife with you ?
<user1> Yes , she just got here yesterday .
<user0> Have you been to California before ?
<user1> No . I've never been there .
<user0> Have you ever been to Las Vegas ?
<user1> Yes . I went there once on a business trip .
<user1> I ' m very pleased with their performances . Timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . That ' s very fast for a kid his age .
<user0> He ' s not very good at the long jump though , is he ?
<user1> He ' s not bad . He can jump a distance of over four meters . I think he just prefers running to jumping . Jimmy ' s very good at the high jump . He can jump over two meters . Again , that ' s fine for someone his age .
<user0> Two meters ? That means that the high jump bar is above his head ! Are any of them good at long-distance running ?
<user1> The longest race we run is the 1500 meters . A few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes .
<user0> How are they at swimming ?
<user1> They ' re ok . I ask them to swim 500 meters each day . That ' s 20 lengths of the swimming pool . They ' re not very fast , but that ' s ok . I just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape .
<user0> Kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters .
<user1> I ' d be afraid to jump from that height !
<user0> I think that these kinds haven ' t learnt to be afraid yet . She started diving from a lower height , but she soon wanted to go higher .
<user1> It seems that they really enjoy trying to go faster , higher and further .
<user1> Yes , it is . We've been dating for over 7 years . We have decided to get married on a special day and we think August 8th , 2008 is a red-letter day .
<user0> Good for you ! It sounds like you've done a lot of planning in a very short time .
<user1> Yes , there is a lot of to be taken care of---wedding photos , wedding dress , catering , transport , hotel , etc ...
<user0> Is everything ready now ?
<user1> Almost . The only thing that isn't ready is the hotel . As a lot of people have chosen that day to get married , it is hard to find a hotel that isn't too expensive .
<user0> Have you tried The Peninsula Palace Beijing ? My wedding reception was held there and they did an excellent job .
<user1> Yes , we called , but it is booked up . The only choice is the Regent Beijing but we haven't made up our minds yet .
<user0> It's an excellent hotel . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive .
<user1> That's why we want to have a look at other hotels . We don ' t want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception .
<user0> I guess you're right . I can help you ask other hotels . I am sure there are probably some available .
<user1> Thank you .
<user0> My pleasure .
<user1> Sorry , I thought you knew .
<user0> But you should have told me you were in love with her .
<user1> Didn't I ?
<user0> You know you didn't .
<user1> Well , I'm telling you now .
<user0> Yes , but you might have told me before .
<user1> I didn't think you'd be interested .
<user0> You can't be serious.How dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ?
<user1> Sorry , I didn't think it mattered .
<user0> Oh , you men ! You're all the same .
<user1> Yes . You've done a good job . But there's one thing . You should narrow down your topic .
<user0> What about water pollution instead of pollution ?
<user1> I ' m fine . Thank you .
<user0> Do you need anything ?
<user1> I need you to help me .
<user0> What can I do for you ?
<user1> I am looking for an article in a newspaper .
<user0> Did you check the periodicals ?
<user1> I didn ' t even bother to think of that .
<user0> I ' ll show you where to find your article .
<user1> I get lost in this library .
<user0> It ' s right this way .
<user1> Thanks a lot for your help .
<user1> Tonight ? I'm afraid I can't . I've promised Mark to go to the gym . Can we make it tomorrow ?
<user0> No problem . Let's say 6:30 p . m . at the Royal Restaurant , OK ?
<user1> All right . See you tomorrow night .
<user1> I'm very busy these days . It seems I can never finish my work .
<user0> Well , take it easy ! Don't let it get on top of you .
<user1> I'll try . I'm under a lot of pressure right now .
<user0> Why don't you take a few days off ?
<user1> I can't . I am really behind of my work .
<user1> Yes , I can , but not very well .
<user0> Where did you learn it ?
<user1> At school . And I'm still learning it now .
<user0> How long have you been learning it ?
<user1> About three years .
<user0> Can you speak any other languages ?
<user1> I'm afraid not .
<user1> Good afternoon , Mary . How's business ?
<user0> Not bad , thanks .
<user1> God ! Don't you think they should get you an assistant ?
<user0> Yes , they were supposed to , but so far nobody's turned up , and I have to do the work alone . This is the first break I've had all day .
<user1> They're really running you into the ground . Why don't you ask for some time off ? You could take a long weekend and have a good rest .
<user0> I'm afraid I can't before I finish this project .
<user1> You'd better pay more attention to your health .
<user0> I will , thanks for your concern .
<user1> You're welcome .
<user1> What happened ?
<user0> My som was lost . I told him to stand rooted to the spot when I went shopping , but he ignored it .
<user1> How did you find him at last ?
<user0> It was the police wo helped me to do that .
<user1> It must have taught you a lesson this time .
<user1> Why ? I think it ' s convenient and good .
<user0> No . The decoration has been out-of-date . My friends have a whole kitchen now . It ' s modern .
<user1> Why should we run after the fashion ?
<user0> I am not running after the fashion . I just want a very beautiful and clean kitchen .
<user1> I'm crazy about it.It makes me very excited .
<user0> Then tell me what's good about it .
<user1> It can't be expressed by words .
<user1> I have no idea . Maybe she had a fight with her husband .
<user1> Wow , fantastic . I like the font and color for his name . It is creative yet personal .
<user0> Yes , it is a bold design . People will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . It just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
<user1> I agree . Business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . It won ' t take much time to design an amazing card , but it can make a big difference among the crowd . And you ' ll always notice it from your collection . For they have outspoken colors , own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . I wish to have one like this . But for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow .
<user1> Oh , yes . My wife bought it for me yesterday . Hmm , you look nice in that yellow dress . Yellow suits you really well .
<user0> Maybe . Several people have suggested that I get more yellow clothes . They say the color suits me because I have a fair complexion .
<user1> That's right . You know , pink , green and black could also be good for you . Actually , I think that all colors are okay for a person with your complexion . It's just that different colors can give people different impressions . For example , black could make you look mature , while pink could make you look young and energetic .
<user0> Thank you for your compliments . It sounds like you're a clothing expert .
<user1> Well , compared with my wife , I'm just a beginner .
<user1> What ? Why do we have to do that ?
<user0> Well , at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon . This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth . In any case , to take better advantage of the daylight available , we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour .
<user1> I see . That ' s convenient ! I never understood things like this , such as GMT . I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock !
<user0> That just stands for Greenwich Mean Time . Here in California , we are in Pacific Standard Time , that is eight time zones west of Greenwich . Remember when we were in Beijing ? Well , then we were in China Standard Time , and that ' s eight time zones east of Greenwich !
<user1> That ' s why it was so weird traveling from Beijing to LA ! Because of the huge time difference , even though we left Beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours , we still arrived in LA the same day at noon ! It ' s like we went back in time !
<user1> Yes , I ‘ d love to . it ' s interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good .
<user0> I like watching it for the fashion . I like to see what the ladies are wearing . Of course , the men nearly always just wear the traditional tuxedo .
<user1> Sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . Which films do you think will win awards this year ?
<user0> I ‘ m really not sure . Usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony , but this year there are several contenders .
<user1> You ' re right . This year should be much more exciting than usual . What ' s you favourite award category ?
<user0> You might think this strange , but I like the category for best foreign language film .
<user1> It ' s nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on Hollywood . I like the best actor and actress .
<user1> We have two cleaning ladies . But both of them have received little education .
<user0> Most cleaning ladies are illiterate . But some of them do a very nice job .
<user1> But I actually dislike another lady . She is more capable and seems to have ideas of her own . But the trouble is she is a backseat driver with some of us . She would tell you what to do and where to put things .
<user1> There are parades in many cities and people fly the national flags from almost every public building .
<user0> What kinds of parades are there ?
<user1> The parades are usually military ones , but sometimes there are procession of people carrying flags and singing patriotic songs . What do you do on national day in your country ?
<user0> We don ' t have a national day .
<user1> Really ? That ' s unusual .
<user0> I guess it is . Most countries have on , but we don ' t .
<user1> Actually , even though we have parades , most people just use the national day holiday to visit family or go shopping . In the evening , many people watch special TV shows which celebrate national day .
<user1> No , not this weekend . I have too much work to do .
<user0> Where do your parents live ?
<user1> My father lives in Washington DC .
<user0> How about your mother ?
<user1> My mother died two years ago .
<user0> Oh , I am sorry to hear that . Is your father still working ?
<user1> No , he's retired .
<user0> Do you have any family here ?
<user1> Yes , two of my cousins live here and my aunt and uncle live about 30 miles from here .
<user0> Do you have any brothers or sisters ?
<user1> Yes , I have two brothers who live in New York and a sister who lives in Boston .
<user0> Do you see them a lot ?
<user1> Not as much as I'd like to . Usually just on holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas .
<user1> Not great . It's a kind of boring .
<user0> Really ? I heard it was supposed to be great .
<user1> Yes , me too . But I'm disappointed .
<user1> Nothing .
<user0> Why do you look unhappy ?
<user1> I ' m rather disappointed at not being able to see my best friend off .
<user0> Oh , cheer up . He ' ll understand you .
<user1> I hope so .
<user1> Really ?
<user0> But I think Henry is a backroom boy.He always helps her with her study .
<user1> You're right .
<user1> That is awesome . Congratulation ! I know you can make it .
<user0> Thanks . Let ' s go for a celebration this evening . Are you free ?
<user1> Yes . Wait for me at the cafe down my office building . See 5PM , ok ?
<user0> No problem . See you !
<user1> See you !
<user1> I do ! My favorites are Mexican , Thai , and Indian .
<user0> Really ? Have you ever tried Moroccan ?
<user1> I can't say that I have . What are the basic ingredients ?
<user0> I don't know . A friend of mine said I should try it .
<user1> Do you know where a Moroccan restaurant is ?
<user0> As a matter of fact , he gave me this address .
<user1> Let's go there for lunch ! I'm up for an adventure !
<user1> But not as good as your mother's , right ?
<user0> Actually , it's better ...
<user1> What ? Are you kidding ?
<user0> No . It was the only dish she wasn't good at . So we could use you as the new head chef ...
<user1> Oh , Uncle Giovanni . That's wonderful ! Thank you ! Thank you !
<user0> OK , OK . Get back to work . There's someone waiting for you in the kitchen ...
<user1> Five.My father , mother , brother , sister-in-law and me .
<user0> Is your brother older or younger than you ?
<user1> He is five years older than me , He got married last Sunday.My brother and my sister-in-law are the same age .
<user1> I am going to a movie theater . You know there is a new action film produced by Hollywood . A thriller , really .
<user0> Another terror film ? There is too much terror and violence in the films . Do you like seeing such a picture ?
<user1> I don't really like seeing bloody frames , but I appreciate the lifelike frames simulated with the highly skillful special effects .
<user1> No , I didn't . And you ? Was it good ?
<user0> Yes . I did . I enjoyed it a lot.There was a folk singer , a violinist and a pianist .
<user1> How much was the ticket ?
<user0> I only paid two dollars for mine .
<user1> It's unbelievable ! They are only married for one month . Then who is at fault ?
<user0> Mary said she couldn't put up with Tom , for he fell in love with another woman .
<user1> Do you think they'll become reconciled ?
<user0> No , I don't think so . She said she would rather be single than cope with an unhappy marriage .
<user1> What a shame ! Their marriage is really a mistake .
<user1> sure . Beijingers are distinguished for their warmth and hospitality .
<user0> as far as you could see , is dining at a Chinese table a distinct experience ? To what extent does it differ from that in your homeland ?
<user1> to begin with , I have to use chopsticks .
<user0> but you look quite proficient in using them now .
<user1> certainly . After all , I've been here for two years . It's not much uphill work for a foreigner to get used to Chinese dinner utensils . Though , I do feel hazy about how to behave appropriately at a Ch
<user0> yes , table etiquette . There are a multitude of rules that foreigners might never know until they were told . Some practices even appear somewhat awkward or rude to Westerners , while they are the norm i
<user1> anything strang about that ?
<user0> maybe you should have placed them horizontally over your bowl or plate . They resemble two incense sticks used at sacrifices . It's very inauspicious , and might enrage all present .
<user1> oh , sorry ! There's a long story even with a mere pair of sticks .
<user1> Don't be so angry . It's passed anyway .
<user0> I can't forget it .
<user1> You'd better cool yourself down first .
<user1> How many credits for each course ?
<user0> Three , you also should take two three-credit-course in education department .
<user1> Thank you , sir , I'm sure I will .
<user1> Me too .
<user0> Why do you hate to go outside ?
<user1> I meet too many jerks .
<user0> I agree .
<user1> This city is full of jerks .
<user0> Rude people are everywhere .
<user1> But what can you do ?
<user0> You can yell at them .
<user1> And they will yell back at you .
<user0> Yelling doesn't do any good .
<user1> No . The best thing to do is just stay home .
<user1> You mean you suspect him .
<user0> I ' m not sure . I ' ll try to prove my feeling .
<user1> I hope I can do something for you .
<user1> You do ?
<user0> Yeah , those classics from the great writers .
<user1> But I find Japanese ones better .
<user1> Why doesn't he ask her ?
<user0> He is too scared to ask her .
<user1> He's a chicken guy .
<user1> Good morning .
<user0> What does the paper say ?
<user1> Nothing much — the same old stuff . A lot of bad news as usual .
<user0> Well , what ' s the weather report ?
<user1> Sunny and mild today , cloudy and rainy tomorrow .
<user0> Did they find those bank robbers ?
<user1> Not yet . They were holding two men in Ohio , but they let them go . They weren ' t the criminals after all .
<user0> What about the sports page ? What were the scores of last night ' s games ?
<user1> Here ' s the paper ; you can read them yourself .
<user1> It really depends on when and how long
<user0> Until next weekend . that ' s ok .
<user1> But Saturday is my birthday .
<user0> I think it ' s important to do now . We can have a birthday party for you when you come out of the hospital .
<user1> But it won ' t be on my birthday .
<user0> But your health is more important . Believe me !
<user1> Why ? They are fine .
<user0> Because they are too violent . Some of them are even disgusting .
<user1> Indeed there are bad games . But many of them are good .
<user0> If boys grow up with computer games , they will surely become bad .
<user1> Come on . Things are not so bad . Boys can learn to use the computer through games .
<user1> Yes , I am . What's up ?
<user0> Then would you please go to a dance party with me ?
<user1> With pleasure . I suppose you dance often .
<user0> Oh , no . As a matter of fact , I haven't danced for a long time .
<user1> But I am told that you dance wonderfully well .
<user0> Thanks for flattering me . I think you dance a lot , right ?
<user1> No . Just occasionally .
<user0> What's your favorite dance ?
<user1> It's hard to say , but I do love the foxtrot and waltz .
<user0> How about rock'n'roll ?
<user1> To tell you the truth , I don't like it . It's too noisy .
<user0> And the tango ?
<user1> Oh , it's really beautiful , but I just can't do it well .
<user0> Don't be so modest . I'm sure you can do it very well . Then I'll meet you at six . Is that at all right ?
<user1> OK .
<user0> Great ! I'm your lucky fellow then .
<user1> Yes , my friends like to get along with me well .
<user0> Do you have many friends ?
<user1> Yes , I like to make new friends .
<user0> What do you usually do with them ?
<user1> We like to get together , chat and enjoy beautiful music .
<user1> Don't feel like it . I'm broke .
<user0> Well , we can still do some window shopping , can we ?
<user1> Just look around ? Nah , that ' s boring .
<user0> I'll go by myself then .
<user1> Great idea ! Peter , I could use the drink .
<user0> How about the new bar across the road ?
<user1> Sounds good . The food there is fantastic too .
<user0> I agree , I had lunch there last week .
<user1> Excellent ! That sounds like a plan .
<user1> No , I'm Korean . Where are you from ?
<user0> I'm from America . Are you settling in all right ?
<user1> I've already found a flat and it's quite comfortable . What about you ?
<user0> I live in my uncle's house . He came here ten years ago .
<user1> What do you think of the local accent here ? Has it been causing you any problems ?
<user0> I think it's just a matter of getting used to it .
<user1> I can't agree more .
<user1> Me ? You're the one who pulled out in front of me !
<user0> There was plenty of room for me to pull out.You didn't have to stay in the lane you were in .
<user1> Hey , listen . I had every right to stay in the lane I was in.You were supposed to wait until I passed to pull out.And anyhow , you didn't give me any time to change lanes.All of a sudden--BANG--there you are right in front of me .
<user0> I think my arm is broken .
<user1> Sorry about your arm , but it serves you right . You need to learn how to drive . You're lucky you didn't get killed . And I'm lucky to be alive too .
<user0> Listen , let's just wait until the police get here.Then we can decide whose fault this accident was .
<user1> Fine with me . I know the laws of the road . I'm not worried .
<user0> I have a cell phone in my car . Now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side.Why don't you get it for me , and then I can call the police ?
<user1> Alright .
<user0> It doesn't work . It looks like it's broken . I need to get to a hospital . You should drive me there .
<user1> Oh , yeah ? It's better if we make a police report first . Then you can go to the hospital .
<user0> Damn it ! I'm injured here . We could wait all day for the police .
<user1> Well , you'll just have to wait . I'm not going to move my car until the police arrive . I'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone . Don't worry . You'll get to the hospital in time .
<user0> It really hurts .
<user1> Yes , maybe it does.But if you're going to drive like you did just now , you will have to get used to a little physical pain . You know what I mean ?
<user0> To hell with you . The accident was your fault .
<user1> I'm afraid it wasn't . And when the police get here , you will also see that it wasn't . But enough of this bickering . I'm going to go find a phone.Don ' t move that arm while I'm gone . Alright ?
<user0> To hell with you .
<user1> Yes . They were open this morning when I came to work . They must've finished remodeling . Why do you want to know ?
<user0> Well , I thought that maybe we could go there for lunch today . That is , if you haven't promised to go with someone else .
<user1> That'd be wonderful , Peter . But I hope you're in a better mood than you were this morning .
<user0> I'm sorry I was such a grouch . It must've been the weather . When it rains I get depressed .
<user1> Forget it . I'll see you at 11:30 am .
<user1> And ?
<user0> And she did her best to pull out the thorn in her flesh and the boy lost whatever made him happy .
<user1> Poor child !
<user1> What's your excuse this time ?
<user0> Have I used the one that my sister is sick ?
<user1> Yes , twice last week .
<user0> Are you sure ? I thought I said it was my mother .
<user1> I don't think so . But it could've been .
<user0> Well . You can trust me this time . My sister is definitely sick . I'm just coming from the hospital . They say she might even die .
<user1> I don't buy your story . Try not to have any more sick relatives this week , all right ?
<user0> I'll do my best .
<user1> Just try to be a little more punctual in the future .
<user0> I'm working on it . Really !
<user1> Not much , except that my mother-in-law is driving me up the wall .
<user0> What's the problem ?
<user1> She loves to nit-pick and criticizes everything that I do . I can never do anything right when she ' s around .
<user0> For example ?
<user1> Well , last week I invited her over to dinner . My husband and I had no problem with the food , but if you listened to her , then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . There's just nothing can please her .
<user0> No , I can't see that happening . I know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen .
<user1> It's not just that . She also criticizes how we raise the kids .
<user0> My mother-in-law used to do the same thing to us . If it wasn't disciplining them enough , then we were disciplining them too much . She also complained about the food we fed them , the schools we sent them too , and everything else under the sun .
<user1> Gosh , you took all the word right out of my mouth . Let's go out and get crazy tonight .
<user0> Let's go to the new club on West Street .
<user1> Sure , but what do I wear ?
<user0> You can wear that pretty red dress .
<user1> Nothing really , why , what ' s up ?
<user0> If you are free , maybe you would like to go to a small party and having for my birthday party . It will be fun , you will get to know lots of people .
<user1> Sounds great , I'd very much like to accept your invitation , thanks , when ?
<user0> Around six pm .
<user1> Do you need help setting up or anything ? I don't mind . I like to do that kind of thing . It's fun and I have a good eye for decorating .
<user0> No . thank you . I can handle it , but thanks for the offer .
<user1> Ok , I will see you then .
<user0> Great , have a good day , thanks again for the offer .
<user1> Hello , I ' m Mark . I ' m just wondering if you are free this weekend
<user0> Yes , I think So .
<user1> Good . I was thinking that I ' d like to invite you to watch a movie . I can meet you at the cinema gate .
<user0> What ' s the time ?
<user1> Six thirty , tonight .
<user0> Oh , I ' m sorry I can ' t because I have to do some housework.You can ask Jenny to go with you
<user1> All right.Maybe next time I can go with you.Bye !
<user0> Good bye !
<user1> Don't ask such a question . You know it has no certain answer . Everyone knows it is in his heart .
<user0> Then do you think that life is arranged by something above us .
<user1> Maybe , the whirligig of time , who knows ?
<user0> Right .
<user1> Really ? How did you get the chance ?
<user0> You know . I took part in the Chinese contest . I was the best and they gave me this reward . I don ' t have to pay for my trip .
<user1> Congratulations . How lucky you are !
<user0> Thank you . I ' m leaving tomorrow morning .
<user1> I ' m sure you ' ll enjoy the trip . China is such a beautiful country .
<user0> I ' m sure I will .
<user1> Have a nice journey , Lily .
<user0> Thank you , David .
<user1> Oh , I love him too . He not only sings well but also shows perseverance when he encounters difficulties in the contest .
<user0> Yeah , he got booted after his initial performance in the audition , but he did not give up . He then tried at another two auditions .
<user1> He had barely survived the third audition and finally got a chance to advance in the contest . Fortunately , in the third audition , he has won popularity among the audience . And that's when I started to notice him .
<user0> Me too .
<user1> Before he made the top three , I was so nervous . I just fear that he might be knocked out .
<user0> Yeah , there're so many excellent candidates out there . Who knows which one will make it to the final ?
<user1> Absolutely . That's why when he entered the final , I was so excited .
<user0> He really did a great job in the finale , especially in the PK round . He performed so well that the majority of the audience cast their votes for him .
<user1> And the host announced that he won it all !
<user1> Hi , Gary , what happened ? I was waiting for you at the theater . Why didn ' t you meet me there ?
<user0> I thought we were supposed to meet here .
<user1> Don ' t you know our movie starts at seven ? And we were going to meet at the theater at five to seven . Then it doesn ' t make sense to meet at the apartment .
<user0> I ' m sorry . We must have misunderstood each other .
<user1> Why don ' t you try to be clearer about your intentions ?
<user0> You ' re right . I am sorry . Let ' s go and watch the movie .
<user1> It ' s okay . I don ' t want to go now . We ' Ve already missed ten minutes of the movie . I don ' t want to see a movie without watching the beginning .
<user1> It is in that brand new , tall building over there . On the 9th floor .
<user0> Where is the school cafeteria ?
<user1> It is the basement of that red building in front of the tower with big bells .
<user0> Where is the Computer Center ?
<user1> The Computer Center is on the first floor of the library .
<user0> Where is the library ?
<user1> The library is next to the Adminstration Building . The Adminstration Building is over there near the school ' s main entrance . There are school maps for free in the lobby of the Admin .
<user0> Thank you . I will go get one .
<user1> Sure . Glad to be of service . By the way , my name is Mike Sullivan . You will see me around a lot . I am running for President of the Student Government .
<user0> Well , hi ! My name is Eve Markowski . I am glad to meet you . With your friendly smile and helpful attitude . I am sure you will win .
<user1> Thanks you for the encouragement .
<user0> You are welcome . I ' d better go . Goodbye .
<user1> Have a good day . Bye-Bye !
<user1> No , thanks . I've had more than enough.In fact , I must be running along .
<user0> Stay around for a while.The party is warming up .
<user1> I'm afraid I have to leave . I have to be up early tomorrow .
<user1> When is it ?
<user0> It falls on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month .
<user1> Could you tell me the origin of the two festivals ?
<user0> OK . The Dragon Boat Festival is a way to commemorate a great ancient poet named Quyuan . On that day , people will hold a boat race as a symbol of the attempt to save him who threw himself into the river .
<user1> Why do people eat rice cakes on that day ?
<user0> In order to prevent the fish from eating the poet's body .
<user1> It sounds so moving .
<user1> Bob ! I hear your team won the match .
<user0> Yeah . All of us tried our best .
<user1> Congratulations !
<user1> If I want , I can protect myself by paying through an escrow account , which holds the money until I receive the item .
<user0> That proves my point ! Protect yourself or you'll get burned .
<user1> eBay also offers free insurance . You can get a refund of up to $ 200 if you're not satisfied with your purchase .
<user0> $ 200 ? If they get a hold of your credit card number , you're going to be out a lot more than $ 200 ! I had a friend who ...
<user1> Oh , it's nothing to speak of .
<user0> No , seriously . I am impressed .
<user1> Thank you . I appreciate the compliment .
<user1> Hey Tina . What are you doing ?
<user0> I was just watching TV . What's going on with you ?
<user1> I just watched a movie and I'm scared .
<user0> What did you watch ?
<user1> I saw the Sixth Sense . I didn't know it was going to be so scary .
<user0> I remember that . It was a great movie . But it was definitely scary .
<user1> If you're not busy , do you want to come over ? I'm afraid to be alone .
<user0> Sure . I can come over . What should we do ?
<user1> How about if we watch a comedy . I need something to get my mind off the frightening images I have from the Sixth Sense .
<user0> Ok . I'll get ready and leave . I'll see you in about 20 minutes .
<user1> Hurry , ok . It's dark out .
<user0> Don't worry , nothings going to happen . I'll be there real soon .
<user1> Ok . See you soon .
<user1> sure I am . I've been writing a blog for almost three years .
<user0> oh , it seems that I'm the only one who never blogs . When did you get started ?
<user1> I began blogging when I first went to the US for my graduate strides .
<user0> what do you usually write about ?
<user1> at first , I'll write about my life there . Like interesting things on the campus , travel stories , special English words that I come across . Sometimes , I'll post my pictures on my blog so my family an
<user0> that's interesting . How often do you write a blog ?
<user1> it's random . If there happen to be a lot of things going on , I may add several new entries in a week , and if I've got nothing to share , I may leave my blog untouched for weeks .
<user0> got it . Are you still updating your blog ?
<user1> sure , since I came back from the US , I've been keeping the habit of blogging , simply to share my personal insights on any topic I like .
<user0> good for you . I know many people just leave their blogs alone after the first few months .
<user1> No , not yet . I ' m still looking . I ' Ve been doing some work through a temp-agency though .
<user0> What kind of work ?
<user1> I ' m temping at a pharmaceutic company .
<user0> What do you do there ?
<user1> Mostly office work - filing and so on .
<user0> How long is the assignment ?
<user1> Till the end of the month .
<user1> En ... it tastes good . I appreciate what you have done for me .
<user1> But we just drove across town . Can't we just go in to see him one last ...
<user0> I'm afraid not . But at tomorrow's funeral , the family requested an open casket service .
<user1> This is all too fast . He's my best friend , and now he's gone .
<user0> I'm sorry . I know it must have come as a great shock .
<user1> The viewing was for saying goodbye , and I didn't even get that .
<user1> He must be green . It ' s lucky that we will get off soon .
<user1> I feel eggplants are more nutritious .
<user0> But as a matter of fact , potatoes taste better .
<user1> Oh , that's how you see it .
<user1> Now what are you doing ?
<user0> Putting on mascara .
<user1> Nasty . You'd better not rub your eyes .
<user0> I won't .
<user1> And you'd better not cry or you'll have black streaks running down your face .
<user1> Yes , I'm hungry . What types of food sound good ?
<user0> Maybe just a quick sandwich , salad , or something .
<user1> I have a great idea of where you might like to go .
<user0> Can we walk there ?
<user1> It's on the second floor . May I join you ?
<user0> Of course ! Let's go .
<user1> Let's hurry . I'm starving !
<user1> I want to go traveling .
<user0> Do you have any where in mind ?
<user1> Yes , I've been thinking about Florida .
<user1> Sorry , I just worried about him . You know , he should be here an hour ago .
<user0> Don ' t worry him , he has been grown up and I think he can take himself very well .
<user1> But he still does not come back .
<user0> Maybe he is on the way home now .
<user1> For almost two years .
<user0> Almost two years ? Your English is very good .
<user1> Thank you . But there's still a lot for me to learn .
<user1> Johnson ? I can't place them .
<user0> We met them in Bermuda last May .
<user1> They've completely slipped my mind .
<user0> The couple with the dogs , think back .
<user1> No , I don't recall a thing about them .
<user0> Well , I've invited them for brunch .
<user1> Hmm , I must be getting absent-minded .
<user1> What a miser ! He cycles to school every day .
<user0> His grandfather's money is not his .
<user1> I can't understand him anyway .
<user1> He said he would tell us the secret of becoming a successful man .
<user0> It ' s too good to be true ! If I were there , I would ask him if he himself was a successful man .
<user1> Nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question , you know .
<user1> hey , Isabelle ...
<user0> Logan ! Why on earth are you hiding here ? White hat ! Come on ! Don't tell me you're the guy ! It can't be true .
<user1> yes , I am the guy ...
<user0> what a bummer ! You set me up ?
<user1> let me explain . I didn't mean to hurt you ...
<user1> Well , I'd like to , but I am not sure I have time .
<user0> Oh , come on ! Just a quick one !
<user1> All right , just a quick one .
<user1> Certainly . Jackie Chan is a very famous movie star in Hong Kong . His Chinese name is Cheng Long .
<user0> Ha , I know Cheng Long a lot , he has made 40 films since 1976 . And at that time he was promoted as the new Bruce Lee . But I'm not familiar with his English name .
<user1> OK . Then tell me what else you know .
<user0> Some movie stars measure their worth by how many millions of dollars they make . Do you know how Jackie Chan measures his worth ?
<user1> He measures his worth by how many of his bones he has fractured while executing his film , incredible stunts . By the way , can you count the breaks ?
<user0> Sure . His skull , his eyes , his nose , three times , his jaw , his shoul-der , is chest , two fingers , a knee . As he said ' Everything from the top of my head to the bottom of my feet ! '
<user1> Indeed you know much about him .
<user0> This is because he is the action-movie incarnate or action-star extraordinaire around the world .
<user1> Oh , that's all right .
<user0> I must apologize . I'll buy you a new one tomorrow .
<user1> No , please don't . I couldn't let you do that .
<user1> Yes , what's it ?
<user0> What does mph stand for ?
<user1> It's miles per hour .
<user1> Wait ! Look at that board , what's on it ?
<user0> ' Please don't enter the bamboo groves . ' We're not allowed to go in .
<user1> Then we'd better not go .
<user0> OK .
<user1> Not yet . I'm not finished with my research yet .
<user0> What research ?
<user1> Reading my fashion magazines ! How do you think I know so much about all the latest trends ?
<user0> But they're just ads .
<user1> Duh ... That's the point . The people in the ads are wearing what's in . Plus , there are articles on new trends .
<user1> I think there ' s a Western on .
<user0> Do you mind if we watch it . I ' d really like to see it .
<user1> Well , I really wanted to see the football game .
<user0> Football game ? Ok , and you know what comes on next ?
<user1> I believe there ' s a sitcom .
<user0> Are you interested in watching it ?
<user1> Let me look in the TV Guide first .
<user0> Oh , I am sorry . What's on Channel 2 at 10 pm ?
<user1> If I remember correctly , it's a quiz show .
<user0> Do you want to watch it ?
<user1> Let's watch it together .
<user1> It was funny .
<user0> Tell me about it , will you ?
<user1> Well , we drove through the valley on our way there in the morning . It was a magnificent sight .
<user0> Did you stop at the big waterfall for pictures ?
<user1> Sure , we wouldn't miss it for anything . After that , we took a short cut to the park . There was very little traffic , so we got there in less than an hour .
<user0> You were lucky then . What did you do after that ?
<user1> We went for a swim in the sea . That was the best part of the day . Just look at my nice tan .
<user0> So you must have had a busy and enjoyable day yesterday .
<user1> Yes , you're right . And I was so tired that I fell asleep on the way back . My arms are still stiff from the swim yesterday .
<user1> How do you know that ?
<user0> She told me that Peter and she has a quarrel last nigh , and she left this morning , bag and baggage .
<user1> Oh , I see . But I think you are making a fuss . They will make it up . Bet it .
<user1> What do I do with it ?
<user0> Do you want me to help you ?
<user1> Please .
<user0> Look . Here are the core classes . Everyone has to take them .
<user1> So I don't have to worry about them .
<user0> You're catching on ! However , there are elective courses like wood shop , metal shop , home economics ...
<user1> I'll take home economics .
<user0> Good . Now you can pick classes by yourself .
<user1> But I ... I don't agree with thatbecause computers weaken kids'ability to thinkbecause kids don't learn basic skills .
<user0> What do you mean ?
<user1> They can't spell , they can't add , they can't subtract , they even don't remember any more . that's because they rely on gadgets .
<user0> That's not the gadgets . Creating programmes is stimulate thoughts . It engages their imagination and sharpen their mind .
<user1> Yeah , what ' s up ?
<user0> Next Monday is my birthday , and I would like you to attend my party .
<user1> Wow . I'd love to .
<user0> Great !
<user1> When and where ?
<user0> Five o ' clock that afternoon , and in my place , you know ?
<user1> Yes , I know . I appreciate your invitation .
<user0> I am going to invite other guys . See you that day .
<user1> See you .
<user1> I'm pretty tired these days .
<user0> Why ? You're not working so don't you have a lot of time on your hands ?
<user1> I have so much house work to do . I have to take care of the kids , cook , clean , laundry , and the cycle never ends .
<user0> How about your husband . Does he help much ?
<user1> Not at all . He comes home and complains about his hard day at work . He expects me to do everything . He even wants me to feed him sometimes . Can you believe that ?
<user0> That sucks .
<user1> If he wasn't so lazy , I think I wouldn't have any complaints . He mows the lawn , but can you believe he tried to convince me to do it ?
<user0> That's crossing the line .
<user1> Oh well . I'll have to live with it . What else can I do ?
<user1> Of course . It's the tradition game in winter , and with good reason . Don't you like watching it ?
<user0> Of course I do . I love it . All the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable .
<user1> That's true . For various reasons , it takes more to hold a fierce game for Winter Olympics than it does for Summer Olympics . You know , the low temperature may cause many problems .
<user0> Yeah . What's the difference between the Winter Olympics and the Summer Olympics ?
<user1> When the Olympic Games started in modern times , only summer events were included . When it grew popular , there came the Winter Olympic Games , which includes a variety of winter sports .
<user0> I see . Then , what's your favorite winter sport ?
<user1> Figure skating . In my eye , nothing beats it .
<user0> Then you must know Shen Due and Hao Hongbo .
<user1> Oh , I didn't expect you to know them . But yes , I love them not only because of many medals they've won , but also because of many medals they've won , but also because of their spirits .
<user0> You should go to talk with May . She is a big fan of them too .
<user1> I want to travel .
<user0> Where would you like to go ?
<user1> The seaside .
<user0> That's really a good idea . Taking a walk on the beach and lying in the sun are pretty good . I recommend you Qingdao or Dalian .
<user1> I ' Ve been to Qingdao before , so I ' ll choose Dalian . I've heard that the environment there is very good .
<user0> Yes , that's a good place to spend a holiday . Last year I went there . It's really .
<user1> Thank you !
<user1> No , thank you , Mrs . Carter . I'm fine for now .
<user0> Just make yourself at home . The other guests should be arriving shortly .
<user1> Thank you very much for your kindness .
<user0> Is there any clue ?
<user1> No , he left nothing .
<user1> Oh , I ' ll go to shanghai to practice there .
<user0> That ' s a good idea . It must be easy to find a job in shanghai .
<user1> I think so , you know there is a great deal of opportunity for business there .
<user0> And English is very useful in your job .
<user1> I think it will be very useful in many ways . Beside , shanghai is an important trade center , not only in China , but also in the world , English is useful in almost all walks of life .
<user0> You will be a very promising one .
<user1> That ' s my wish .
<user1> Yes , my parents , and soon my brother as well .
<user0> I didn't know you had a brother .
<user1> Oh , yes , he is two years older than me . He lives in New Zealand so I don't see him that often .
<user0> Oh , nice . Is he coming on his own or with the family ?
<user1> His son is coming as well . He wants to go to university here in England so they will visit a few universities while they are here .
<user0> Does your brother have just one son ?
<user1> No , he has two daughters as well . His wife and daughters are visiting her parents . So I won't see them .
<user0> I'm sure your parents are looking forward to seeing their grandson .
<user1> Oh yes , they are really looking forward to it . They went to New Zealand last year and loved it .
<user0> So when are they all coming ?
<user1> My parents are already here . My brother and nephew are arriving on Monday .
<user1> I am swapped with work after 10 - day holiday .
<user0> Where did you spend your holiday ?
<user1> I went to Paris .
<user1> I'm from Canada , originally .
<user0> From Canada ? Where were you born ?
<user1> Montreal .
<user0> When did you come to Los Angeles ?
<user1> We moved here when I was fourteen .
<user0> Did you go to school here ?
<user1> Well , I went to high school here , but I went to college in Texas .
<user0> Did you get a job right after graduation ?
<user1> No , I traveled for a while in Europe after college , and then I lived in France .
<user0> When was that ?
<user1> Let's see ... That was about six years ago .
<user0> I bet that was interesting . What did you do there ?
<user1> I studied French . Anyway ... that's enough about me.How about you ? Were you born in L . A . ?
<user1> Yes , I'm a very good mother and successful career woman .
<user0> How can you manage to do both ? I mean , it is so hard to be a working mother .
<user1> I think the most important thing is that you should be nice to yourself , like keeping housework simple , spending money on things that make life easier , buying yourself things you like , and so on . You can only be nice to others when you can be nice to yourself .
<user0> Does your husband feel the same ?
<user1> Yes . He is very understanding and supportive .
<user1> let me give you a little advice . You know what the topics are going to be , so prepares what you would like to say in advance .
<user0> I often do , but I ' m worried about the responses from other people .
<user1> you have to be realistic . Not everyone is going to agree with you , but people will respect your opinion and they will respect the fact that you have contributed something to the discussion .
<user0> I ' m worried that what I say will not make sense .
<user1> we could chat about the topic before class . I could check that what you want to say is logical and it would also give you a chance to practice speaking .
<user0> that ' s a good idea . What should I do if I am in two minds about a topic ?
<user1> that ' s easy . Express possibilities . People will think that you are pretty smart to be able to look at the topic from more than one angle .
<user0> I didn ' t realize that speaking in class could be so easy .
<user1> the most difficult thing is being able to predict what other people will say . They will reply to your statements , but you can ' t be sure how .
<user1> He used to be a policeman .
<user0> But Mrs.Smith hired him to find her lost son .
<user1> Yeah . He's a private eye now .
<user1> Where do they come from ?
<user0> I don't know . Something rotten here ?
<user1> I can't see it .
<user1> My invitation ? No , I haven't . My invitation to what ?
<user0> The house warming party .
<user1> Whose house warming party is it ?
<user0> Tom and Bill Smith . They are both working now you know ? And they've bought a new house .
<user1> Oh , they have ? I didn't know . I haven't seen Tom lately .
<user0> It's out in the suburbs .
<user1> Have you seen the house ?
<user0> Yes , I have . I went out with them last weekend .
<user1> Is it nice ?
<user0> Yes , it is . There are three bedrooms , a living room , a dining room , and a big kitchen .
<user1> There's also a garden .
<user0> Well , that does sound nice . Have they moved in yet ?
<user1> They are moving today . Tom's taken the day off . He's rented a truck , and they should have all their furniture in the house tonight .
<user0> When are they going to have the party ?
<user1> Next Saturday night . You should get your invitation today or tomorrow .
<user0> Wow , that would be something to look forward to .
<user1> I could go for that . But I'm afraid our budget is a little tight this year .
<user0> oh , but I really need to leave this town for a change . Working day after day has worn me out . Do you have any other suggestions ?
<user1> we should probably think about going somewhere that isn't too far away . How about the countryside ? There must be many interesting places , and we could enjoy the fresh air and the delicious local spec
<user0> wonderful ! I think that's a great idea . How soon until we can make this happen ? I can't wait !
<user1> tomorrow I have an appointment with my dentist . What about next Monday ?
<user0> perfect . I'll start preparing tomorrow . If we're going to drive , I'll need to fill up the tank .
<user1> no need . I think it's still plenty full . Even so , I'd rather travel by bus or train . It would cost much less than driving . Oil prices are soaring nowadays , you know .
<user0> we can take the train , that will be faster . I'll book the tickets tomorrow morning .
<user1> great ! Oh , one more thing , don't forget to check the weather before we go . I'd hate to get caught in the rain .
<user0> no problem . I'm really looking forward to the coming week .
<user1> Me , too . Now let's make a list for what we need to take with us .
<user1> Sounds good . Where are we going ?
<user0> Somewhere new . It's a great place to pick up chicks .
<user1> Need a new . girlfriend , huh ?
<user0> Yeah , I broke up with Lisa.She blew a gasket over it . Whoa , get a load of that !
<user1> Whew ! That getup is terrific !
<user0> Never mind the getup.She ' s beautiful !
<user1> That too .
<user0> I'm gonna introduce myself .
<user1> If you're lucky , that might do the trick .
<user0> Oh , oh , that tears it ! I'm getting out of here .
<user1> Hold on ! What's the big hurry ?
<user0> My ex-girlfriend's here.If she sees me , my goose is cooked .
<user1> I wanna finish my drink first . I'll meet you at Sammy's .
<user0> OK , catch you later .
<user1> Darlene ! Indeed , it ' s been a while ! How have you been ? Wow , you look amazing ! I love what you ' Ve done with your hair !
<user0> Really ? Thanks ! I went to that hair salon that you told me about , but enough about me ! Look at you ! You haven ' t aged a day since the last time I saw you ! What is your secret !
<user1> Ha ha , come on ! Well , I ' Ve been watching what I eat , and working out three times a week . By the way , I heard your son recently graduated !
<user0> Yes , my little Paul is finally a doctor . They grow up so fast you know .
<user1> He is such a handsome guy . He gets his looks from his mother of course !
<user0> Thank you ! What about your daughter , Pamela ? I heard she has passed the bar exam and married recently .
<user1> Oh yes . She had a beautiful wedding in Cozumel Mexico and we all attended .
<user0> Such a lovely girl . I hope my Paul is lucky enough to find a girl like that someday !
<user1> But of course ! Well , it ' s been great talking to you , but I have to get going .
<user0> Same here ! We will catch up soon , maybe over coffee !
<user1> That would be great ! Give me a call !
<user0> See you soon ! Bye ! Egg ... I can ' t stand that woman or her obnoxious daughter .
<user1> Yeah . It was hard . When do you take it ?
<user0> I take it tomorrow morning . There is so much material that I dont know what to emphasize on . What types of questions did you get ?
<user1> Mostly on the civil war . You should also study the impact Martin Luther King Jr . had on American society .
<user0> What about Abraham Lincoln ? Did you get any questions about him ?
<user1> I only had 1 question about him . But you might get more . I dont know if he will have the same exam or not .
<user0> Hopefully he will use the same exam , cause Im going to spend most of my time studying the civil war . It is a huge section and that is what he lectured the most on in class .
<user1> If you cant study everything , then that is probably the best way to go .
<user0> Aright . Thanks for the info . I gotta go to the library now .
<user1> Good luck .
<user0> Thanks . See ya .
<user1> It's us .
<user0> What do you mean by " us " ?
<user1> Well , we used to talk to each other before we were married . Remember ?
<user0> What do you mean ? We ' re talking now , aren't we ?
<user1> Oh , yes , but we used to do so much together .
<user0> Yes . I remember . But we never used to argue . You used to think I was wonderful . Where are you going ?
<user1> Back to live with my parents . That's something else I used to do before we were married . Remember ?
<user1> Yes.Do you like it ?
<user0> It's great . and I ' Ve heard that listening to Mozart can make you more intelligent .
<user1> Really ? I've never heard that before . I just like it .
<user0> Is classical music your favorite ?
<user1> Yes . What about you ?
<user0> I Like pop music best . Classical music is a bit too heavy for me . I can't get fully relaxed in it .
<user1> Pop music doesn't have any depth for me .
<user0> Yeah , that's why I can enjoy myself in it .
<user1> Did you always like pop music .
<user0> I think so , since I was in primary school . How long have you been interested in classical music .
<user1> I didn't like it at all until I started to learn violin when I was eight . From then on . classical music has been an important part of my life .
<user0> oh , I didn't know you can play the violin . Do you still play .
<user1> Sometimes , but these days I'm often too busy .
<user1> Most people were living form hand to mouth . How could they ?
<user0> Yeah . They simply had no extra money to save up or for other things .
<user1> Fortunately , things are changing these years .
<user1> A friend and I are planing to go out , why ? what's up ?
<user0> There is a special exhibition of french sculptures at the museum , I was hoping you ' d like to come with me .
<user1> I am afraid I can't I am going to be out all day .
<user0> What about sunday ?
<user1> i wish i could , but it's my mums birthday .
<user0> Maybe next week .
<user1> Much as I ' d like to , I am afraid i wont be free next week , I have a lot of work .
<user0> Sorry to hear that , I was really looking forward to spending some more time with you , I really enjoyed our last chat .
<user1> I am really sorry too , maybe I can give you a call sometime .
<user1> Yeah , I ' m going for a hike in the southern Rocky Mountains .
<user0> Oh , do you go hiking often ?
<user1> I go as much as I can . I love hiking because you can really get in touch with nature .
<user0> It would be nice to get out of the city . Do you want some company ?
<user1> Sure . But , it will be a long hike , 30 miles in three days . Have you been hiking before ?
<user0> Yeah , I go a lot too . I saw a bear and a mountain lion on my last hike .
<user1> Wow ! You must have been pretty far away from the city .
<user0> Yeah , my friend and I hiked in a very wild part of the national forest .
<user1> Well , bring him along too . We ' ll have a great time this weekend .
<user0> Thanks , I ' ll ask him .
<user1> I don't know if anything terrible has happened .
<user0> I have reported it to the police .
<user1> We'd better prepare for the worst .
<user1> He won the decathlon in the 1976 Olympics , right ?
<user0> I read that he trained so much that he used to dream about jumping hurdles .
<user1> I can think of better things to dream about ...
<user0> Sometimes he would wake up covered in sweat , with his legs pumping away .
<user1> That's crazy .
<user1> What's wrong with it ?
<user0> What's wrong with it ? It's filthy !
<user1> Oh ...
<user0> It's filthy because you never wipe your shoes .
<user1> Sorry , love .
<user0> What are you looking for now ?
<user1> My cigarettes .
<user0> Well , they ' re not here.They are in the dustbin .
<user1> In the dustbin ! Why didn't you tell me before ?
<user1> Yes , I do . But my characters are very bad .
<user0> It takes a long time to learn Chinese writing .
<user1> Are you Chinese by birth ?
<user0> Yes , I am . I am from Guangzhou . I am here to study international relations .
<user1> How do you like it ?
<user0> I like it so far . But my English still needs work .
<user1> I want to study Mandarin and public relations .
<user1> Sure . It's probably a skiing show . Adam told me there are many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
<user0> Look at that . It's so dangerous . My mom would never allow me to do that .
<user1> Stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
<user0> You are right . But what if an avalanche happened ?
<user1> They are all great skiers and very experienced . So I suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
<user0> Anyway , the show is breathtaking . By the way , where did they get so much snow here ?
<user1> Well , they have the most advanced snowmaking machine .
<user0> Do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
<user1> It's possible .
<user1> Two , I hope and I hope that by telling me about them you are planning on taking me !
<user0> Of course ! And here's the best part , they are court side seats !
<user1> How in the world ! Who came up with seats like that from your company ?
<user0> Some guy in the accounting department has a brother on the team !
<user1> Can't beat that ! Thank you accounting guy !
<user0> The game starts at seven so we'd better hustle , it's already five .
<user1> What are we waiting for ? Let's go !
<user1> OK ! How about Scrabble ?
<user0> No , no , a friend of mine taught me this really fun game . I ' m going to describe someone ' s face , and you guess who it is !
<user1> OK !
<user0> Let ' s see . He has a roman nose , bushy eyebrows and dimples !
<user1> Our cousin Pete ! My turn ! She has a pointy nose , sunken eyes and a mole on her chin !
<user0> Aunt Rose ! That mole is so huge ! OK , my turn . He has a crooked nose and full lips . He has quite a few freckles and an oval face . Oh , he is also bald !
<user1> Your future husband !
<user0> Not funny .
<user1> It bears a great many of advantages , but also some weak points .
<user0> Is it ? I've never thought of any disadvantages of the mobile phone .
<user1> For instance , the mobile phone seriously distracts the attention of people from work and study .
<user0> That's true . Some people pay too much attention to their mobile phones .
<user1> Actually , it's not the fault of the mobile phone . But people should have a proper attitude towards it . Mobile phone is a tool serving people , not the fetters restricting them .
<user1> Good news ! And congratulations !
<user0> You are invited to my wedding .
<user1> Thank you . I'll certainly be there .
<user1> Sure . But it's a very difficult one , you need to have a dictionary at your elbow .
<user0> But I'm not used to looking up every new word when I'm reading a novel . I only look up the most necessary ones .
<user1> I ' m afraid many people would turn thumbs down on it .
<user0> Don ' t you think in that case , there wouldn ' t be so much stealing ?
<user1> Definitely . But I think it is too fierce .
<user1> Sure , but let's get a pitcher this time We should be able to down it before they close .
<user0> That sounds good . You order the beer while I go to the bathroom . Where is the can in this place ?
<user1> It's all the way to the back . See that yellow door ?
<user0> Yeah . I think I can find it .
<user1> You're back already . That sure was quick .
<user0> That's because I just took one step inside and turned right around . That bathroom is too gross for me .
<user1> Well , the bartender wouldn't give me the pitcher of beer . Anyway . He said it was too close to closing time .
<user0> Let's leave then . I could take some fresh air , anyway .
<user1> Okay , let's go !
<user1> well , I spend a lot of time watching movies .
<user0> what a confidence ! I always watch a lot of movies , too .
<user1> oh really , Frank ? What kind of movies do you like ?
<user0> actually , I watch whichever movie there is , be it a comedy , a sci-fi or a suspense movie . How about you ?
<user1> art films are my favorite , but thrillers are cool , too .
<user0> really impressive . These two genres are totally different .
<user1> sure . I enjoy both of them very much .
<user0> how often do you go to the cinema ?
<user1> once in a while , I suppose , I usually rent movies at Movie Salon .
<user0> movie salon ? where is that ?
<user1> it's a movie rental store in my neighborhood . I've got a membership there .
<user0> is it good ?
<user1> yes , you can find almost all new releases there .
<user0> really ? Maybe I shall also sign up for its membership .
<user1> why not ?
<user1> Really ? That's so great . Congratulations .
<user0> Thanks . I'm so excited . We've been trying for 8 months now .
<user1> That's really exciting . How many months are you pregnant ?
<user0> Three months .
<user1> Are you going to find out if it is a boy or a girl ?
<user0> I want to , but Bob doesn't . He wants to be surprised like the old fashioned way .
<user1> Maybe it's more exciting not knowing .
<user0> I'd rather know and buy all the baby things ahead of time .
<user1> There are so many things you have to prepare for .
<user0> I know I am going to be busy , but I know I can handle it . I have been looking forward to this day for a long long time .
<user1> It really must be an exciting time for you guys .
<user0> Thank you so much .
<user1> She didn ' t expect to get a kick in the teeth after a day ' s hard work .
<user0> Poor girl !
<user1> Unbelievable ! How do people go through it ?
<user0> That's what I'm wondering , too .
<user1> I wish I had a chance to see it with my own eyes .
<user1> Much to my regret , I'll have to meet my girlfriend at the airport then .
<user0> We'd like to invite you for our dress party tomorrow evening , are you free ?
<user1> Much as we'd like to , but we've booked up already for that time .
<user0> What a pity ! You can't join us .
<user1> So sorry . Next time we'll go , thanks anyway .
<user1> Thank you for your inition . I'm free tonight .
<user0> Which kind of food do you like , chinese food , western food or sea food ?
<user1> I prefer sea food .
<user0> ok . I'll pick up your hotel at 6 thirty pm .
<user1> That's fine . I'll be waiting for you .
<user0> See you later .
<user1> bye .
<user1> If that happen to me , I ' ll take them back to the shop .
<user0> I did . But they said they won ' t change them .
<user1> That ' s terrible . But if they wouldn ' t change them , I know what I would do .
<user1> Of course ! It is the No . 1 stressor in my life . You know job stress has become a very common problem these days . So we must learn to cope with it .
<user0> Totally agree . What is your solution ?
<user1> Well , there are two causes of job stress . One is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . So if we want to manage job stress , both we and the companies should do something . For me , I am trying to balance work and leisure time . You know , all work and no play make Jack a dull boy .
<user0> You seem to have a very relaxed outlook .
<user1> It is necessary . Positive attitude helps to prevent stress .
<user0> But I don ' t think we can change our working condition . Anyway , we are not the bosses .
<user1> I heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them , like avoiding unrealistic deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . Our boss is a smart person . He will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team .
<user1> Can I help you ?
<user0> I ' m not sure . Perhaps you could do the shopping .
<user1> I ' ll be glad to help .
<user0> Or maybe make the beds .
<user1> All you have to do is ask for help .
<user0> Thanks . That ' s terrific !
<user1> I ' m ready and willing to help .
<user1> Good . I love Chinese food . What did you order ?
<user0> Something hot and spicy . They look very inviting on the menu . You are going to love them .
<user1> Maybe we can find a place to learn some Chinese cooking . I hear there's a place in Chinatown where you can take some courses . Are you interested ?
<user0> I'm not sure . I don't enjoy cooking that much . As long as we can order it from a restaurant , we don't have to learn to do it by ourselves .
<user1> You are right . But I just want to know how they prepare food and make it taste so different .
<user1> I couldn't do that . I have an important meeting to go to today .
<user0> Do you feel ok ?
<user1> Not really . After a 12 - hour flight , I've got jetlag , and on top of that , I think I've also got the flu .
<user0> Why don't you call your secretary and tell her to reschedule the meeting ? You should really get some rest or you'll end up feeling even worse than you do now .
<user1> Could you feel my forehead and check to see if I have a fever ?
<user0> You're really hot . Let me get you some Tylenol to bring the fever down .
<user1> Ok . I'll stay home this morning and rest , but if I feel better in the afternoon , I'm going to the meeting .
<user0> Zach , what's that on your arm ?
<user1> I don't know . It looks a bit red , but I'm sure it's nothing .
<user0> It looks like you have a red rash all over you ! Are you allergic to anything ?
<user1> Just cats , but I don't think I was near any cats in the last couple of weeks .
<user0> I completely forgot about your cat allergy . I took care of a cat for my friend here a few days ago . Oh no . we'd better go to the doctor and get some medicine . Let's go .
<user1> Shouldn't we make an appointment first ?
<user0> We would , but let's just go and see if there's an opening now before it gets worse .
<user1> Whatever you say . I just want to get to my meeting !
<user1> That's too bad .
<user1> Yes , most of the time . But , sometimes things can get difficult .
<user0> Can you tell me about it ?
<user1> You know , sometimes patients can get very unreasonable . They may insist they are sick when they are not .
<user0> What can you do when this happens ?
<user1> Not much , usually I'll just keep silent .
<user1> Not yet .
<user1> We'd better go out for a walk .
<user0> Which season do you like best ?
<user1> Spring .
<user0> How about summer ?
<user1> I dislike it most .
<user0> Why ?
<user1> Because the hottest season is summer in a year .
<user0> But sometimes summer is more charming than the other seasons .
<user1> It was a real red letter day for you .
<user0> Yeah . We rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home .
<user1> Cool , fellow , what's the date today , buddy ?
<user0> It's ... oh it's the 1st April , April Fool's Day .
<user1> You forgot all of about it , didn't you ?
<user1> Okay . Keep in touch .
<user1> I ' m sorry , we have no mid-size available at the moment .
<user0> I don ' t understand , I made a reservation , do you have my reservation ?
<user1> Yes , we do , unfortunately we ran out of cars .
<user0> But the reservation keeps the car here . That ' s why you have the reservation .
<user1> I know why we have reservations .
<user0> I don ' t think you do.If you did , I ' d have a car.See , you know how to take the reservation , you just don ' t know how to hold the reservation and that ' s really the most important part of the reservation , the holding . Anybody can just take them .
<user1> But we do have a compact or an SUV if you ' d like .
<user0> Fine . I ' ll take the compact .
<user1> Alright . We have a blue Ford Focus for you , Mr . Fox . Would you like insurance ?
<user0> Yeah , you better give me the insurance , because I am gonna beat the hell out of this car .
<user1> No , I think Harry will get it .
<user0> Let's make a bet on who gets it .
<user1> OK , loser buys pizza tomorrow night .
<user1> Well , I was wondering where those people with professional attire come from . Now , I know the answer .
<user0> You know , in a sense , a suits and ties are compulsory for male employees even in July , and no jewelry allowed for most of the female employees . Even the reasonable male leaf is returning the rule , isn ' t that strict ?
<user1> To some extent , it is . Anyway , whether they like it or not , they do give people a very good impression .
<user0> But it is unjust to judge a book by its cover . If they ' re not happy or comfortable with their clothes , they can be less productive .
<user1> Didn't you hear ? He was disqualified .
<user0> How did that happen ? He's so talented ! I thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal !
<user1> If he didn't have any drug problems , he would have won .
<user0> What ? What kind of drugs was he using ?
<user1> He was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster .
<user0> I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs .
<user1> They are . The only reason they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards .
<user0> That's so disappointing . I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs .
<user1> I don't think it's right , but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country !
<user0> Regardless of how much pressure you're under , there's never a good reason to take drugs .
<user1> I agree . Hopefully with the new regulations , fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs .
<user0> Let's hope so .
<user1> That's because Americans love sitcoms .
<user0> Sitcoms ?
<user1> Situation comedies . A sitcom is half an hour long and it airs weekly . Sitcom shows tend to be about ordinary people . If there is one thing that all the shows have in common , it is teaching wholesome values .
<user0> In Taiwan , prime-time shows are an hour long and most of them aren't comedies .
<user1> I think Americans would rather laugh than cry or be scared in their free time .
<user1> Yes , I am . I enjoyed studying it at school , though I had trouble remembering all the dates , so my teacher never gave me good marks .
<user0> I love history , but I ' Ve always thought that learning the reasons behind events is more important than remembering exactly when they happened .
<user1> I wish you had been my history teacher ! I might have got better marks !
<user0> Some people say that history repeats itself .
<user1> What does that mean ? The same events never happen twice , do they ?
<user0> The idea is that the people and dates change , but the reason why things happen stay the same .
<user1> I see . I think I ' d agree with that statement . People often seem to make the same mistakes over and over again .
<user1> You , too .
<user1> You see , I've been offered a new job . I can't decide whether to take it or not .
<user0> Oh , that's easy . If it's better than the one you are doing now , go for it . That's my advice .
<user1> It isn't that easy . I hate to quit my present job . People around here are very nice and the work itself is challenging .
<user0> Then what about the salary ? Would you get more ?
<user1> Yes , they say I would get a big sum .
<user0> Have you discussed it with your wife ?
<user1> Yes , she leaves it to me .
<user0> As I say it the work is well worth try . After all you can get a higher salary .
<user1> I have to think about it .
<user1> Both actually . S , Y , B , I , L .
<user0> Of course .
<user1> That ' s great . He ' s the best runner I ' Ve seen this season . I ' m sure he ' ll win a medal at the Olympics .
<user0> I think you ' re right . I think we have a very good athletics team . They should do well in the Olympics . How many medals do you think we ' ll win ?
<user1> I really don ' t know . I don ' t think we ' ll win many gold medals , but I think we should win several silver and bronze ones .
<user0> What do you think our chance are in other events .
<user1> In the last Olympics , we did very well in swimming , cycling and ball sports . I think we ' ll do well in those same events .
<user0> We might get a gold medal in the sailing too . Our team put in a lot of practice .
<user1> I think we can expect to get between 30 to 40 medals in total .
<user0> You are very optimistic !
<user1> I may have something on that day , but thanks for inviting me .
<user0> Well , drop by if you can .
<user1> I will , do you want me to bring anything ?
<user0> No , just bring yourself . I hope to see you there .
<user1> Really ? But his wife has always waited on him hand and foot .
<user0> I hear that John's leading a double wife .
<user1> It's very bad of him to cheat on a lady like his wife .
<user1> I haven't played chess for a long time .
<user0> That's all right , I'm a beginner . I've just learnt how to play .
<user1> Look , there's a chessboard . Those two men have already finished playing .
<user0> You're a very good player
<user1> Not really , but once I won a prize .
<user0> So did I . I won a prize last week but it was a prize for beginners .
<user1> My prize was for the best player in the country . Now let's start playing chess seriously .
<user1> Yeah , about .
<user0> Do you know Chinese better now ?
<user1> Oh , definitely . I remember , when I first arrived in Guangzhou , my girlfriend was haggling with a sales clerk over the price of a mobile phone .
<user0> Oh , yeah . Many Chinese like to bargain . It happens almost everywhere .
<user1> I mean , I understand that . But the speed of the conversation got faster and faster , until it seemed to me that they would fight . My perception of the tone was that it was a violent shouting match . The truth was that it was a perfectly normal conversation .
<user0> A shouting match ? You ' re so funny . You must be exaggerating . I don ' t believe it .
<user1> I am not exaggerating at all . I ' m telling you the truth . That was how I felt at that time .
<user0> Yes , perhaps . Chinese usually don ' t notice that sort of thing . Maybe it ' s quite natural to us .
<user1> Yes , absolutely true .
<user1> Harry Potter .
<user0> Harry Potter ? Is that book funny ?
<user1> Actually , the language itself is not so funny , but you can imagine the scene , that's funny .
<user0> Got it .
<user1> Have you ever read this book before ?
<user0> No , but my little brother likes it very much .
<user1> It's really a good book . You will like it too .
<user0> I'll try to read it . Actually , I like literature very much .
<user1> Wow , that sounds like a scholar . By the way , who's your favorite writer ?
<user0> Jane Austen .
<user1> Me too . Pride and Prejudice is my favorite .
<user0> I like it too . But Sense and Sensibility is my favorite .
<user1> Thanks , Tim.Nice meeting you , too .
<user0> I guess we'll see just around .
<user1> Ye , I hope so.well.Take it easy .
<user0> You too .
<user1> I've had it with Tim ! I think I'm going to quit !
<user0> But Sandra ... you love your job ! You spent months trying to get this position . It's perfect for you !
<user1> Yeah ... I know . But I'm sick and tired of all the office power struggles !
<user0> What kind of power struggles are you talking about ?
<user1> Basically , I think Tim is threatened by me . I'm doing a better job than he is so he's trying to sabotage my career !
<user0> So he talks about you behind your back ?
<user1> Yes . He's all nice and friendly to my face . But the second I turn around he stabs me in the back !
<user0> I had a worker like that once . She was always taking credit for my ideas .
<user1> I should keep a better record of my correspondence with the clients so if necessary I can prove it was my effort .
<user0> My co-worker had a whole bunch of bad office habits . She liked to name-drop ... we would be in a meeting and she would say , yesterday I was chatting with Tom . She meant Tom Solomon ... our CEO .
<user1> What is it ? What happened ?
<user0> I think someone is stalking me .
<user1> No , it can't be . Really ? Who ?
<user0> I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking , but staring.He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop .
<user1> What did you do ?
<user0> I didn't do anything . Finally , he left.But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too .
<user1> Did he leave when you left ?
<user0> Yes . Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . He was following me .
<user1> What did you do ?
<user1> Yes , I know a great place . What types of food do you like ?
<user0> Mexican , Japanese or Chinese would be great .
<user1> Oh , I know a place where you might like to eat .
<user0> Is it close by ?
<user1> It's down a block on the right ; can I show you the way ?
<user0> OK , I'd love the company .
<user1> This will work out well . I'm getting hungry just thinking about it .
<user1> when I was young , my parents took me to the one in California . I always forget which — is that one Disneyland or Disneyworld ?
<user0> the one in Florida is Disneyworld and the one in California is Disneyland , so you must have been to Disneyland .
<user1> that's right . Why do you ask ?
<user0> well , I've never been to either so I was thinking of going to Disneyworld for my honeymoon .
<user1> when are you getting married ?
<user0> some time next year . We haven't set the date yet .
<user1> congratulations ! I had no idea .
<user0> thank you . So what do you think ? Would we have a good time ?
<user1> do you like amusement parks ?
<user0> for the most part , yes . Some of the rides are bit too scary for me , though .
<user1> if you don't think twice about the rides and go on every ride that you can , you'll have a good time .
<user0> even the roller coasters that go through tunnels in the dark ?
<user1> even those . It'll be very romantic , I think . You'll have loads of fun .
<user0> thanks for the advice . I'll talk to my fiance about it tonight .
<user1> I'm sure he'll love the idea . Just throw yourself into it and you'll enjoy it !
<user1> Steve ! Haven't seen you in ages ! How long's it been ?
<user0> It's got to be almost a year now .
<user1> How have you been ?
<user0> I'm pretty good . I've been looking for a place to live recently . My lease runs out next month and I don't want to renew it .
<user1> Yeah , I remember the neighborhood . Have you found a place yet ?
<user0> Not yet . But I am still looking through the classifieds . Wish me luck .
<user1> Well , maybe I can help . Remember my neighbor ?
<user0> Mrs . Thou ?
<user1> Yes , her daughter's having a baby , so she's moving in with her to help out . I think if you are interested , you can come over and have a look .
<user0> Great . It's a lovely neighborhood . And it would be nice to be neighbors again . It would be just like the old days !
<user1> I'll ask Mrs . Thou when she's available to show the apartment and let you know . Has your number changed ?
<user1> Yeah . Dig my new pants ?
<user0> Copycat !
<user1> What do you mean ?
<user0> You went out and bought khakis , too !
<user1> No . Mine are a soft brown . Yours are khaki .
<user0> Whatever .
<user1> No , what ?
<user0> He's got a promotion .
<user1> You're kidding .
<user0> No , they made him vicepresident in charge of sells .
<user1> I don't believe it.He is only being with the company for two years .
<user0> Well , it's true.The board man last thirdly and they choice Paul .
<user1> Well.Good for him .
<user1> I think the supermarket is closed now .
<user0> Oh , When does it close ?
<user1> It closes at 7:00 on Sundays .
<user0> That's too bad .
<user1> Don't worry , we can go tomorrow morning . It opens at 8: 00 .
<user0> Alright . What do you want to do now ?
<user1> Let's take a walk for a half an hour . My sister will get here at about 8: 30PM and then we can all go out to dinner .
<user0> Where does she live ?
<user1> She lives in San Francisco .
<user0> How long has she lived there ?
<user1> I think she's lived there for about 10 years .
<user0> That's a long time . Where did she live before that ?
<user1> San Diego .
<user1> No . How about you ?
<user0> Not yet . Let's go to that restaurant on the corner .
<user1> Search me .
<user1> What did you argue about ?
<user0> He borrowed some money from me and I needed it back . He said he didn ' t have the money yet .
<user1> Well , he should pay you back . It ' s only fair .
<user0> Yes , but I got angry with him too quickly . He probably thought that I mistrusted him . I shouldn ' t have got angry .
<user1> Did you lend him a lot of money ?
<user0> Not much . I had to pay an unexpected bill , so I needed the money back .
<user1> Well , talk to him about it next time you see him . He probably feels as bad about it as you do . Close friends sometimes have disagreements . It ' s nothing unusual . Neither of you said anything really nasty , did you ?
<user0> No , we didn ' t . I guess you ' re right . We should patch things up .
<user1> Of course you should . You wouldn ' t want a silly argument to ruin a long friendship , would you ?
<user1> I don ' t think so . I think the government should do everything it can to discourage people from smoking .
<user0> Maybe so . But a law banning cigarettes will do no good .
<user1> No , you can ' t suddenly make smoking illegal , but government could prohibit smoking in public places like movies and theatres .
<user1> Yes . Dolphins have a big brain and they are very smart . They are also the fastest swimmers in the world .
<user0> They must be amazing animals .
<user1> They are . I read a story about a dolphin saving a A from drowning in the sea .
<user0> I read that story too . They seem to be able to understand men .
<user1> They sure can . Maybe they can interact with men better than monkeys and apes .
<user1> I am not surprised , you eat too much .
<user0> And I suppose sitting at the desk all day in the office doesn't help .
<user1> No , I wouldn't think so .
<user0> I do wish I could lose weight .
<user1> Well , why don't you go on the diet ?
<user0> I've tried diets before but they've never worked .
<user1> Perhaps you should excercise more . Why don't you go to an exercise class .
<user0> Yes , maybe I should .
<user1> All right .
<user0> Here is your ticket .
<user1> Thank you .
<user0> The park will close soon . We Should better go in right now .
<user1> Really ?
<user0> Yes , let's go in .
<user1> It is a new park , isn't it ?
<user0> Yes , how do you know ?
<user1> I guessed it .
<user0> Well , generally speaking , the park is a window on the world history , a window on the world civilization and a window on the world's tourist attractions as well .
<user1> Oh , how wonderful !
<user1> I love dogs . They have been used as guards for centuries . Nowadays , they are often used to find illegal drugs and bombs by the police and customs officers .
<user0> The documentary also pointed out that they are used by shepherds to round up sheep and by rescue workers to find people trapped under rubble or snow .
<user1> Horses are useful to people too . We use them for sports and recreation .
<user0> Don ' t forget that horses are still used in many countries to pull ploughs and carts .
<user1> Can you ride a horse ?
<user0> Yes , I can . I don ' t ride regularly though . How about you ?
<user1> I can ride too . Perhaps we could go horse riding together at the weekend ?
<user0> What a good idea !
<user1> Just call her Lisa , Mary . She's cooking dinner .
<user0> I see . Can I sit down ?
<user1> Of course ! Make yourself at home .
<user0> Thank you , Mr . Johnson .
<user1> Please , just call me Tom .
<user0> Okay , Tom .
<user1> Where's Cindy ?
<user0> She's upstairs in my room .
<user1> Can you tell her to come downstairs ? We're about to have dinner .
<user1> No , what ?
<user0> He's got a promotion .
<user1> You're kidding .
<user0> No , they made him vicepresident in charge of sells .
<user1> Oh , I don't believe it . He is only being with the company for two years .
<user0> Well , it's true . The board man last thirdly and they choice Paul .
<user1> Well . Good for him .
<user1> If we hurry , can we get there in time ?
<user0> I hope so .
<user1> Yes , and it's great . What are the events at the sports meeting ?
<user0> Long-distance race , dash , hurdle race , relay race , standing long jump , high jump , shotput and so on .
<user1> Our neighbor , Bruce , will take part in the relay race . Let's go have a look .
<user0> OK , let's go .
<user1> The competition will begin in 5 minutes , it's tense here .
<user0> Wonderful , Bruce is taking the lead .
<user1> Other competitors have almost caught up with him . They are neck and neck .
<user0> Come on , Bruce . Come on , Bruce .
<user1> Wow , Bruce crossed the line first .
<user1> Yes , they are shy and gentle but very powerful .
<user0> You are right . They sweep Nancy off her feet . And now she fell head over heels in love with him .
<user1> How wonderful it would be if I had such smiles !
<user1> Yes , it's been marvelous . It really was very kind of you to invite me . I hope it hasn't been too much trouble .
<user0> Not at all . We've really enjoyed having you . I hope you'll come and stay again next time you're in Changsha .
<user1> It's a man-made wonder . I've seen it many times in textbooks and it's part of my dream to visit it .
<user0> Someone claimed it was one of the two man-made wonders that could be seen on the moon .
<user1> That's true .
<user1> Do you already know how to play an instrument ?
<user0> Uh ... Yeah ! I ' Ve told you a thousand times that I ' m learning to play the drums . Now that I know how to play well , I would like to form a rock band .
<user1> Aside from yourself , who are the other members of the band ?
<user0> We have a guy who plays guitar , and another who plays bass . Although we still haven ' t found anyone to be our singer . You told me that you had some musical talent , right ?
<user1> Yes , I ' m a singer .
<user0> Perfect . So you can audition this weekend here at my house .
<user1> Great ! Wait here ? You don ' t have enough room for the amplifiers , microphones or even your drums ! By the way where do you keep them or practice ?
<user1> I would like to have that new style Gl Joe .
<user0> Have you asked Santa ?
<user1> Yes and I've written him a letter .
<user1> George , how can we ? Vacations cost money . And this month we don ' t have much money left after paying the rent .
<user0> Well , Lili , we can visit different places in the state in our van 10 . We are not going to take a plane or stay at a hotel this time . Trust me , it won ' t cost much .
<user1> Where will we sleep , then ?
<user0> In the van .
<user1> What about other expenses ?
<user0> Let ' s see . Gas , food , recreation , we won ' t spend much . Come on . Don ' t hesitate . We need to get out of the house once in a while . We have been working hard , haven ' t we ?
<user1> Maybe you ' re right . When do you plan to go ?
<user0> The sooner the better ! I can ' t wait !
<user1> Oh , I don ' t know where we ' re going yet .
<user0> As long as we ' re going , you can decide where to go . I trust your judgments . I know you miss Chinese food , so we can eat at a Chinese restaurant this time .
<user1> Let ' s go to Chicago.We can have lunch in Chinatown.Then we can go to a ball game at Wrigley Field !
<user0> You have such good ideas !
<user1> The science field trip is next Monday at 8 o'clock in the morning . Do you want to make note of that on your calendar ?
<user0> Yes , I will make note of that .
<user1> Next Monday is December 2nd . The buses will leave at 8 , but we must begin loading at 7
<user0> I will be there half an hour early .
<user1> You might want to tell whoever is picking you up that you will return on December 8th . Do you have a ride ?
<user0> Yes , someone is picking me up .
<user1> To get back to campus by 8
<user0> Not at the moment — maybe later , though .
<user1> All of the extra information that you need is on the bulletin board in the hallway . See you on Monday !
<user1> I'm sorry for hero .
<user0> I don't think there's any excuse for his acting in some parts .
<user1> Don't be too critical . We can't expect it to be perfect .
<user1> Great - they wined and dined us all week .
<user1> My boss sent me here to take some business documents back to his office . I didn't know you were working here.What a surprise.How long have you been doing this ?
<user0> Two years or so .
<user1> That is great.Do you have to work the night shift ?
<user0> No , in most cases I don't have to unless there is something urgent to deal with . I work five days a week .
<user1> Do you enjoy work here ?
<user0> It is hard to say.But I've to start by working as a trainee before I really become an experienced marketing assistant.Sometimes , I am really under great pressure when it gets busy .
<user1> Take it easy . I'm sure you will gain enough experience while working as a marketing assistant . I hope you haven't been given much trouble in the job .
<user0> Luckily not.The silent I meet are generally very friendly and have a good boss .
<user1> Glad to hear that .
<user1> What's the second solar system ?
<user0> It's just a system like ours , with a star and a number of planets going around it .
<user1> Is this good news or bad news ?
<user0> It's exciting news ! If we find a second solar system , we might find a second earth !
<user1> You mean with people on it ?
<user0> Yes ! Isn't that exciting ?
<user1> Sorry , I thought you knew .
<user0> But you should tell me you were in love with her .
<user1> Didn't I ?
<user0> You know you didn't .
<user1> Well , I am telling you now .
<user0> Yes , but you might have told me before .
<user1> I didn't think you would be interested .
<user0> You can't be serious . How dare you not tell me you are going to marry her ?
<user1> Sorry , I didn't think it mattered .
<user0> Oh , you men ! You are all the same .
<user1> I didn't really like it .
<user0> Mary said that she was really pleased with the photography .
<user1> I found it very disappointing .
<user0> She liked the acting , too , because that's what she wanted to see .
<user1> I wasn't happy with it .
<user0> Nothing is to your satisfaction .
<user1> Where are you going ?
<user0> I told you already ! I ' m going to get my nails done .
<user1> Again ? You just went last week ! You spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! Honestly , why do you need a manicure every week ?
<user0> Well , first of all , I like to pamper myself , and my nails look great . You should come with me !
<user1> Why ? I don ' t want to have nail polish or anything like that !
<user0> They don ' t only paint my nails ! The manicurist will remove my cuticles , file my nails , and apply at least nails coats of nail polish !
<user1> Yeah , sounds like something I should definitely do .
<user1> Good afternoon ! Sit down , please.How are you ?
<user0> I'm very well , thank you.How are you ?
<user1> Very well too , thank you very much.Isn ' t it a lovely day ?
<user0> Yes , it's beautiful , but it's also very hot .
<user1> Yes .
<user0> What's the weather like in your country ?
<user1> Mm ... It's quite warm now .
<user0> Where do you live ?
<user1> In London.Where do you live ?
<user0> Here.Near this school .
<user1> So what are you gonna do ? Just quit ?
<user0> That ' s exactly what I am going to do ! I ' Ve decided to create my own company ! I ' m going to write up a business plan , get some investors and start working for myself !
<user1> Have you ever written up a business plan before ?
<user0> Well , no , it can ' t be that hard ! I mean , all you have to do is explain your business , how you are going to do things and that ' s it , right ?
<user1> You couldn ' t be more wrong ! A well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . Then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has , history , etc .
<user0> Well , that seems easy enough .
<user1> Wait , there ' s more ! Then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . What they are and how they are different from competitors ' ? Then comes the hard part , a market analysis . You need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables ! You need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to how many children on average the population has ! All this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage , where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea .
<user0> Geez . Is that all ?
<user1> Almost , the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . Here you will calculate and estimate sales , cash flow and profits . After all , people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment !
<user0> Umm . I think I ' ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business !
<user1> So I heard .
<user0> What ' s wrong with her ?
<user1> She went over the edge after her son was killed in an accident .
<user1> How about a movie ? We haven't done that for a while .
<user0> A movie ? Sure . Do you know what's on right now ?
<user1> No . Why don't you check out the newspaper ?
<user0> Ok . Maybe you should invite your sister along , too .
<user1> Not much , that new reality-TV show , Ally McNeal , oooo , Dark Angel .
<user0> Wait a second . I want to watch Ally McNeal .
<user1> Oh , come on . That ' s such a girl ' s show .
<user0> No it ' s not . It ' s just funny .
<user1> Yeah , if you ' re a girl .
<user0> Well , you just want to watch Dark Angel because of the hot girl .
<user1> That ' s not true . Dark Angel is a good show .
<user0> It ' s story is just an excuse to get the girl dressed up in different tight outfits .
<user1> O . K . , O . K . Let ' s forget it . There ' s a football game on too .
<user0> No way . I ' m watching Ally McNeal . Go to John ' s to watch the game .
<user1> What are you talking about ?
<user0> Don ' t you see many parents are forcing there children ' s hands to learn something they think important to their children . But the children are not interested in it at all .
<user1> You said it . Many parents just don ' t know how to educate their children .
<user1> I went shopping .
<user0> Did you buy anything ?
<user1> Yes , I bought a few things .
<user0> What did you buy ?
<user1> I bought this coat . Do you like it ?
<user0> Yeah , I like it a lot . It's very pretty . Where did you buy it ?
<user1> At the mall on 5th street .
<user0> Was it expensive ?
<user1> No , it wasn't expensive . It was on sale for 20 dollars .
<user0> That's cheap .
<user1> I know . It was a really good deal .
<user0> I don't think you'll need to wear it for a while . It's been really hot lately .
<user1> Oh , I'm fine .
<user0> So , are you going to go to class tonight ?
<user1> Maybe ... but I don't think so .
<user0> Really ? What's the matter ?
<user1> I don't know . I'm just feeling a little sad .
<user0> Listen . Come with me to class , and after class we can go out for dinner .
<user1> Now that's a good idea . Thanks a lot , Brian . I'm feeling better already .
<user1> He can barely make ends meet .
<user1> They're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 .
<user0> If the Phoenix beats the Rocket , it will enter the final .
<user1> No way , if it still has 21 .
<user1> It's the best seller everyone's been talking about for the last six months .
<user0> How in the world did you get a copy ? I've put a hold on it at the public library for weeks and I'm still waiting my turn .
<user1> I checked it out of the rental library . It only costs five cents a day .
<user0> Is it really worth paying for ?
<user1> I can't tell yet . I haven't got beyond the first chapter .
<user0> If it's any good , I'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition .
<user1> Wow , I can't catch my breath . You are running too fast , honey .
<user0> You just need more exercise .
<user1> Yes , but you need to slow down . This is jogging , not racing !
<user0> I don't care . I want to burn up my fat .
<user1> But running so fast is not good for people over forties .
<user0> Why ?
<user1> We are not as athletic as we were when young . Mild exercise is more suitable for us .
<user0> But I want to burn up more calories !
<user1> In fact , in order to burn up your fat , you must take it slowly for a longer time .
<user0> Really ? I will slow down then .
<user1> Fine , thank you . I haven ' t seen you for quite some time . What have you been up to recently ?
<user0> I have been spending a lot of time watching movies at home , so you wouldn't have seen me . Recently , I've been obsessed with horror films .
<user1> Oh , how can you be infatuated with horror films ? They're so scary .
<user0> Yeah , you are right I used to not watch horror films , but after seeing Silence of the Lamb with Mike last month , I fell in love with them .
<user1> It's amazing . But if I were you , I wouldn't have the courage to watch the first one .
<user0> But it's really exciting .
<user1> Maybe , but I would rather watch romance , science fiction , crime or even disaster movie instead of a horror picture . I wouldn't dare sleep at night after watching one .
<user0> Basically . you'll watch any type of movie except horror .
<user1> Yep .
<user0> I think you should have a try someday . Maybe you'll change your mind .
<user1> Maybe . After all , I am grown up now .
<user1> The economy has been stagnant for a while now . We've been in a recessive state for several months already . What worries me the most is the trade deficit . I think the government should do more to encourage exports .
<user0> Increasing exports would weaken the currency . I think the main point is economic growth . We need more jobs . Factories have outsourced and moved many jobs to foreign countries . The result is an increase in unemployment in our own country , lower consumption , lower production , and an overall feeble economy . If more people are working , it will give the economy a boost .
<user1> It's true that we should do something about unemployment , but what about inflation ? If unemployment falls , there's pressure to increase pay . That would result in inflation , which would result in a much less dynamic economy .
<user1> Not really . I like going to an art exhibition once or twice a year . I hardly know anything about art or sculpture . You are a true art lover , aren ' t you ?
<user0> I love going to art galleries , particularly when one is holding an exhibition of abstract art .
<user1> I never understand the meaning of those painting . They are too abstract for me . I didn ' t pay much attention in art class at school .
<user0> Art isn ' t for everyone . I ' m going to an exhibition tomorrow at the national gallery . It ' s an exhibition of greek and roman sculpture .
<user1> I like sculpture , especially that from ancient rome or Greece . What time are you thinking of going ? I ' d love to go with you .
<user0> I thought I ' d have an early lunch and go immediately afterwards . Does that sound ok to you ? Bus 51 goes directly there .
<user1> That sounds fine . What time shall we meet at the bus stop ?
<user0> Let ' s meet at 12 thirty . it will probably take us three or four hours to see all of the exhibits .
<user1> My mother works in a company as an accountant .
<user0> Is she busy ?
<user1> Not always , she's rather busy at the end of the year .
<user1> Hello , Jack.Happy birthday !
<user0> My birthday ? I forgot it , Thank you for remembering my birthday .
<user1> I'd like to offer you my congratulations on your birthday and best wishes for your future happiness , good health and continued success . I've asked the Fairy Flowers to send you a bunch of flowers . I hope you'll like them .
<user0> Thanks a lot . I'm so touched .
<user1> Now let me sing " Happy birthday " for you .
<user0> Thank you very much .
<user1> It sure is .
<user0> It's a good day for a picnic .
<user1> I don't want to .
<user0> Well , come over and talk to me then .
<user1> Certainly not .
<user0> May I turn on the TV then ?
<user1> Turn on the TV for what ?
<user0> So that we can sit down together and listen to some music .
<user1> Listen to the music ? And who will cook dinner , will you ?
<user0> I will , but let's go to the disco after dinner .
<user1> To a disco ? Oh , no . You know I hate it .
<user1> Brian ! How have you been ?
<user0> Pretty good . Say , you've really changed !
<user1> Oh , well , I've lost some weight . And my hair is longer than before .
<user0> Well , you look great ! How are you ?
<user1> I'm doing really well . I got married about three years ago . I have two kids now .
<user0> That's terrific !
<user1> It's very nice . There are only four people , and those girls are very kind and friendly .
<user0> Well , do you all major in the same subject ?
<user1> No , the other three girls major in a computer science , and they can help me a lot with the computer operating .
<user0> That's great !
<user1> Well , I swim and run every day .
<user0> Now , tell me , what do you eat ?
<user1> Well , I don't eat any meat , but I do eat fish and eggs .
<user0> Do you eat a lot of vegetables ?
<user1> Oh yes , and fruit , I love fruit .
<user0> What do you drink ?
<user1> Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . They are very bad for you .
<user1> We are going to climb a cliff on the Colorado River .
<user0> How hard is the climb ?
<user1> It is a very difficult climb because there are not many places to put your hands and feet .
<user0> What did you do last week ?
<user1> We rappelled down the side of 300 - foot cliff . It was very exciting .
<user0> Wow ! That sounds like a lot of fun . I ' m sorry I missed it .
<user1> Well , you should come this weekend . I think you could do the climb .
<user0> Yeah , I will . See you then !
<user1> O . K . See you .
<user1> I can speak French and German .
<user0> How well can you speak them ?
<user1> I can speak German quite well , but I can't speak French very well .
<user0> Can you help me to translate these sentences into German now ?
<user1> No , but I'll be able to tomorrow .
<user1> Chill ! I'm just curling my eyelashes .
<user0> It looks like some kind of primitive form of torture .
<user1> You're such a wimp ! You're afraid of an eyelash curler .
<user0> Well , you might pinch your eyelid ! Or lose an eyeball !
<user1> It just makes my eyelashes curl upwards .
<user1> Yes . I'm afraid so .
<user0> But you'll miss out on the football game .
<user1> Oh . Well , it can't be helped .
<user1> Oh , do you really think so ?
<user0> Of course , otherwise you ' ll just have to wait for hours .
<user1> But I just got a call from my sister and I have to cancel the movie tonight .
<user1> That's terrible !
<user1> You see ? Every cloud has a silver lining .
<user1> Come on ! You're pulling my leg .
<user0> Really ! Here's my trophy .
<user1> Wow ! Congratulations !
<user1> Thank you .
<user0> Is that your wedding ring ?
<user1> I'm not married yet . It's my engagement ring .
<user0> Well , congratulations . When is the big date ?
<user1> In June .
<user0> Did you have the watch before getting the ring ?
<user1> Actually , we bought the ring together after I got the watch .
<user0> You did a fabulous job with the selection . It's gorgeous .
<user1> Thank you so much .
<user0> What kind of watch is it ?
<user1> It's a Tag Heer .
<user0> If you don't mind me asking , how much do they cost ?
<user1> This one is $ 1500 . But they range from $ 600 to $ 3000 .
<user0> That's why it looks so nice . I should have figured . You always get what you pay for .
<user1> Yeah . I would rather get one nice watch instead of 20 mediocre ones .
<user1> What for ? ( Why ? )
<user1> Not very well .
<user0> Why ? Looks like you're feeling very down ! What happened ?
<user1> Nothing .
<user0> Come on . For a man who's feeling so , down , there're usually two reasons . Either his career is going downhill , or he has a broken heart . Since you're so successful , it must be the latter .
<user1> Well , you're right . I just broke up with Jane .
<user0> Oh , I'm sorry . I thought you two were made for each ocher .
<user1> Well , you never know . I'm ready for a commitment and want to settle down , but she says she wants to pursue her career while she's still young .
<user0> Well , she is not to blame . It's always difficult to choose between career and family .
<user1> Maybe you're right .
<user0> Jack , I don't know what to say to comfort you , but cheer up ! There are plenty of fish in the sea and you'll find your soul mate , your perfect match !
<user1> Yeah , but it's hard to forget her at moment . You know , we were together for almost five years . It's really hard ...
<user1> Sally . She is a bachelor girl . She is an excellent designer . Many of the company's advertisements are her child trains .
<user0> Why is she still single ? She must have a face that would stop clock .
<user1> Oh , quite the other way round . She is a knock-out . She devotes much of her time to her career .
<user1> My watch is a few minutes fast . It's about six forty , I think .
<user0> Is it ? Oh , no . The concert will begin in twenty minutes . Are we too late to get there ?
<user1> If we start now , we can make it by taxi .
<user1> Yeah .
<user0> Who won ?
<user1> China .
<user0> What is the score ?
<user1> China beat Brazil three to zero .
<user0> Wonderful .
<user1> The boss wanted to pay Bob with stock options . But Bob didn't want to play that game again .
<user0> Again ?
<user1> At his last start-up , Bob worked for stock and no salary . They folded and he made zip .
<user0> Ouch .
<user1> Now he only works freelance . Hundred bucks an hour .
<user1> I'm sorry . I won't do it again .
<user0> Try to be more careful in future . Look ! you've damaged the sign .
<user1> Is this the sign ? What does it says ?
<user0> It says No smoking here .
<user1> Sure . Take a seat ... what would you like to know ?
<user0> First , I ' Ve heard that your latest book is based on a true story .
<user1> That ' s correct . It ' s a murder mystery based on actual murders that book place in Florida several years ago . The main character-the police invesigator-is based on the man who investigated the case .
<user0> How do you research your books ?
<user1> I always visit the places that I use as setting for stories . Readers like things to be as factually correct as possible-even in fiction ! I usually base my characters on people I have met . Most character are a mixture of the characters of two or more people .
<user0> I really like your books . I ' Ve just finished this one . I read it from cover to cover in a single day . Congratulation on making the bestseller list yet again !
<user1> Thank you . Let met sign it for you ... there you go .
<user0> Oh ! Thank you very much . I heard that you are currently writing a collection of short stories . What are the stories about ?
<user1> There ' s a real mix of stories in the book . I haven ' t finished all of them yet , though . Many of them are short detective stories , but there are also horror stories and sci-fi ones . If you give me your business card , I ' ll make sure you get an advance copy to review .
<user0> Thanks very much . I ' m sure it will sell well . I can ' t wait to read it . Here ' s my card . Thank you for you time .
<user1> Oh , you may call him Uncle , or Henry .
<user0> What's he doing ?
<user1> He's checking bags.He ' s an official in the customs .
<user1> That's a wonderful way to celebrate this grand old library !
<user0> I hoped you would be willing to brainstorm with me for party ideas .
<user1> That is right up my alley . You say party and I'm there .
<user0> Perfect . It will be open to the public and we anticipate roughly about five to seven hundred people .
<user1> Will it be an all day event ?
<user0> Yes . And we checked with the city and we have permission to use the park adjacent to the library .
<user1> That was quick thinking .
<user1> Cool ! Flashy red lines !
<user0> I think this is the coolest watch I've ever owned .
<user1> Is it waterproof ?
<user0> Isn't that a silly question ? You know how much of an athlete I am .
<user1> Uh , huh ... so what kind of sports do you need a waterproof watch for ?
<user0> Well , surfing , scuba diving ...
<user1> Yeah , everyday . And there ' s only one choice . All the other buses are going the other direction .
<user0> Hmm . I have the same problem . When I leave work , it ' s always rush hour . So the buses are always crowded .
<user1> Oh , yeah , it ' s terrible . I will tell you the funniest thing I have seen in China . It ' s when so many people try to get onto one city bus , and the last guy is squeezed in so tight that the door is tightly pressed against his butt .
<user0> That sounds terrible the way you describe it . But you know , not long ago I really suffered on the bus .
<user1> What happened ? Were you having a hard time getting on a bus ?
<user0> You just can ' t imagine ! I waited for the first bus but it was too full , so I waited for the second , and it was still very crowded . Then I decided not to wait for the next one , and got on the second bus . It was so full that I had to stand on one foot ! No kidding !
<user1> Hmm . Good exercise , uh ?
<user0> Yeah , absolutely !
<user1> And it ' s so much fun . One day , the bodies were so tightly packed that some girl ' s behind was pressed against my front . I was afraid to put my hands down for fear of accidentally groping her .
<user0> You were so happy , weren ' t you ?
<user1> What do you think ? I ' m a good boy .
<user1> That's great .
<user0> Now let's get things ready .
<user1> Don't worry . There are all kinds of things in the center .
<user0> That's much more convenient . We don't even have to bring the flavorings .
<user1> Yeah , they all received very strict training . A minute on the stage takes ten-year practice .
<user0> And all their movements are so elegant . It seems like dancing in the water .
<user1> Exactly , you know , water ballet puts dancing , music and swimming together .
<user0> There you go ! Daddy has told me that water ballet is also called Synchronized Swimming .
<user1> That's my boy ! Katherine Curtis created this activity in 1920 . And in 1984 , it was authorized as one activity in Olympic Games .
<user0> Wow , Mom is more knowledgeable than Dad . I must learn from you .
<user1> My little boy , you should learn more from me . I'm almost thirty years older than you .
<user0> OK , you're the boss . Look , Mom , one guy has just jumped into the swimming pool .
<user1> Oh , my God . It's so dangerous . And he might break his leg . You mustn't do anything like that .
<user1> The boy is good for nothing .
<user0> As a teacher , I don ' t know how to help him .
<user1> He is hopeless .
<user1> Not bad.We have had a big meeting today , remember ?
<user0> Oh , yea . I forgot.So how did it go ?
<user1> Pretty well . I think the boss liked my ideas .
<user0> Great , so what happens now ?
<user1> Well , I have to write the proposal . I'm pretty excited about it .
<user1> Of course , they are out there .
<user0> But I never saw them .
<user1> Are you stupid ? They are called UFOs , so not everybody can see them .
<user0> You mean that you can them .
<user1> That's right . I can see them in my dreams .
<user0> They come to the earth ?
<user1> No . Their task is to send the aliens here from the outer space .
<user0> Aliens from the outer space ? Do you talk to them ? What do they look like ?
<user1> OK , OK , one by one , please ! They look like robots , but they can speak . Their mission is to make friends with human beings .
<user0> That means that you talk to them ? In which language ?
<user1> Of course in English , they learn English on Mars too .
<user0> Wow . Sounds fantastic !
<user1> Yes . I ' Ve won the first prize in the math contest .
<user0> Really ? Congratulations !
<user1> Thank you , Paul .
<user0> By the way , would you like to have dinner with me tomorrow evening ? Tomorrow is my birthday .
<user1> Good , happy birthday to you !
<user0> Not so soon . It ' s not my birthday today . Well , you ' ll come , won ' t you ?
<user1> Sure , I will . Thank you for inviting me .
<user0> My pleasure .
<user1> Sure . What's up ?
<user1> Yes , that's right . That's the poster of the The Witch .
<user0> May , I really regret watching it with you last night .
<user1> Did it scare you ?
<user0> Of course not . I just thought the movie was ... boring .
<user1> Boring ? Come on , you clutched to my arm all the time .
<user0> Well , I admit . The ghosts were scary .
<user1> I like scary movies .
<user0> That's Gucci's influence . I love science fiction movies !
<user1> Of course you do . They are silly stories just for little kids like you .
<user0> Don't call me kid . I am a grownup .
<user1> Do you dare watch scary movies with me tonight ?
<user0> Of course ! I can watch them without you !
<user1> Oh , really ?
<user1> I am Chinese by birth .
<user0> Where is your domicile place ?
<user1> My domicile place is Hebes Province .
<user1> He's going to turn six next month .
<user0> Who is looking after him ?
<user1> My mother-in - law . She retired last year .
<user0> You really are lucky !
<user1> Yeah , I know .
<user1> Mmmm ... it's hard to say . I like golf a lot-but I guess I like tennis better .
<user0> Do you play much tennis ?
<user1> Yes , quite a bit . How about a game sometime ?
<user0> Sorry . I'm strictly a spectator-football , baseball , basketball , golf ... I watch them all .
<user1> Well , I go to the gym a lot . I am a member of a gym nearby .
<user0> Yeah , how often do you go ?
<user1> About three times a week if I can .
<user0> Not bad ! Do you do any other sports ?
<user1> Not really . I ' d really like to try golf , though .
<user1> Hello , George .
<user0> Have you just been to the cinema ?
<user1> Yes , I have .
<user0> What ' s on ?
<user1> Paris in the Spring .
<user0> Oh , I ' Ve already seen it . I saw it on television last year . It ' s an old film , but it ' s very good .
<user1> Paris is a beautiful city . I have never been there . Have you ever been there , Ken ?
<user0> Yes , I have . I was there in April .
<user1> Paris in the spring , eh ?
<user0> It was spring , but the weather was awful . It rained all the time .
<user1> Just like dear old London !
<user1> It's inevitable . Their love wasbuilt on the sand , and this is why their marriage has landed on the rocks .
<user0> You said it . Love but on the sand will soon be on the rocks .
<user1> That give us a good lesson .
<user1> I'll accompany my wife to the hospital .
<user0> What's wrong with her .
<user1> She is expecting .
<user0> Congratulations to you .
<user1> Thank you .
<user1> I swear never to drink again . Just give me another chance , please !
<user0> How many chances have I given you ? I don ' t trust you any more .
<user1> You know how hard I've tried to give up drinking ? I ' d be lost without you . I won ' t let you go anyway .
<user1> There are a few stories about natural disasters . There is a massive forest fire in Australia . It covers several square kilometers of land has destroyed many more square kilometers .
<user0> Was it caused accidentally or naturally ? Sometimes it gets so hot that fires begin naturally in Australia and Africa .
<user1> Nobody knows at the moment , but it has been very hot there recently . The drought in Africa is causing starvation . Millions of people have migrated to try and find food .
<user0> What is the international community doing to help ?
<user1> The European union has sent several plants with relief supplies . Several countries have sent soldiers to distribute food and medical supplies . Refugee camps have been set up across the region .
<user0> How many countries have been affected ?
<user1> Six have been seriously affected , but the refugees are also migrating to several surrounding countries .
<user0> I saw on the tv yesterday that there has been another earthquake in iran .
<user1> Yes . There have been a few there recently . They say that this one was not a big quake . The Iranians are dealing with it on their own . They have purchased some special equipment to find people buried u
<user0> Does the newspaper say anything about casualties ?
<user1> So far , less than 20 people have died , but over 100 are in hospital .
<user1> Yes , it is.It was taken just before I was leaving for college .
<user0> You look so lovely .
<user1> How time flies ! I'll not see twenty again .
<user1> Yes , I'm now working in a company .
<user0> So you're quite happy with your new job ?
<user1> Right . I enjoy what I'm doing .
<user1> Oh , I ' m afraid I can ' t . I ' Ve had a date already .
<user0> That ' s too bad .
<user1> May be some other time .
<user1> Give it here .
<user0> Who ' s the letter from ?
<user1> I think it ' s my acceptance letter from NYU .
<user0> I want to know what it says .
<user1> They didn ' t accept me .
<user0> Are you serious ?
<user1> It ' s the truth .
<user0> Are you okay ?
<user1> I really wanted to get into NYU .
<user0> I am really sorry to hear that .
<user1> It ' s okay . I ' m still waiting to hear from UCLA anyway .
<user1> My girlfriend just broke up with me .
<user0> You must feel terrible now .
<user1> Yeah .
<user0> I remember my first break up . It was the worst feeling in the world . I was crying everyday for three months . And slowly , it got better . I know you'll feel better too .
<user1> You've been through this too ?
<user0> Yeah . I remember it very clearly . The pain makes it easy to remember . I know you're really hurting right now , but you know many people experience break ups .
<user1> But it hurts too much .
<user0> I know it's painful , but it's only temporary . After the pain goes away , you'll find other girls .
<user1> What if I don't want to find another girl ?
<user0> You'll change your mind . Look at everyone in the world . They all break up and move on . The faster you understand this , the quicker you will recover .
<user1> You're right .
<user0> I also know you must still have strong feelings for her , but try to think of all the bad things . You know she didn't treat you that well . Is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with ?
<user1> Yeah . Thanks for the talk .
<user0> I'll give you a call later . We should hang out . It's good to be around people .
<user1> Ok . I'll talk to you later .
<user1> Let me see . The one goes for $ 17 .
<user0> Would you take $ 12 ?
<user1> No , I can ' t let you have it for 12.How about 14 ?
<user0> 13.50 ?
<user1> Sorry , $ 14 is the lowest I can go .
<user1> Never mind about that .
<user0> I ' m terribly sorry , Won ' t you let me pay for ?
<user1> No , I won ' t hear of it .
<user1> Nice to see you again , too . Peter . How's your family ?
<user0> A :: Very well . How's Mrs Clinton ?
<user1> Not bad , But she's as busy as before .
<user1> You are right . We shouldn't do anything under the table .
<user0> Well , since you agree with me , we should put the issue above board instead of talking about through other channels .
<user1> Hi , Vince . Thanks for stopping by . How's the work coming along for the online auction ?
<user0> Oh , yeah . I'm glad you mentioned that . I think we need to hire somebody new to manage it .
<user1> Can't Elvin handle it ?
<user0> I think he's got too much on his plate .
<user1> How about the soup ?
<user0> I've never tasted anything better .
<user1> How nice of you to say so .
<user1> Not much , just heading over to the shooting range . You wanna come ?
<user0> Seriously ? You mean to fire a real weapon ? I don ' t know man .
<user1> Yeah , it will be fun ! I have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . I also have a revolver that ' s really fun too ! They have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve your aim .
<user0> Yeah that would be cool ! Maybe I can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! Maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! Or what about a flame thrower !
<user1> Whoa , take it easy there Rambo . Don ' t get carried away . These weapons are not toys , and you must first learn how to handle them properly . There are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be safe . For example , never handle a weapon that you haven ' t inspected yourself . Always make sure there isn ' t anything in the chamber , and never put your finger on the trigger unless you are ready to shoot !
<user0> Wow , I didn ' t know ! It always looks so cool and easy in the movies !
<user1> The reality is different you know , running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! So are you ready ?
<user0> Let ' s do it !
<user1> I ' m fine . I ' Ve been out of town . I just got back .
<user0> Where were you ?
<user1> I was in New York for a wedding .
<user1> Don't feel like it . I'm broke .
<user0> Well , we can still do some window shopping , can't we ?
<user1> Just look around ? Ah , that's boring .
<user0> I'll go myself then .
<user1> I don't know . My life is a big mess . Everything is so complicated .
<user0> come on , nothing can be that bad .
<user1> but promise me , you'll keep it a secret .
<user0> ok , I promise . So what's troubling you so much ?
<user1> I've fallen in love with my boss .
<user0> really ? Is he married ?
<user1> no , of course not . He is still single .
<user0> then what's your problem ?
<user1> I try to keep it to myself . But there is a lot of gossip about us .
<user0> oh , I see . Office romance tends to be the subject of gossip .
<user1> worse still , he is trying to avoid me these days .
<user0> office romance is very tricky .
<user1> it gives me a lot of pressure and I feel depressed .
<user0> cheer up , Nada . You'll be fine .
<user1> Oh , nothing special . I'm just a bit tired .
<user0> With the job ?
<user1> With everything , with everybody , with all this !
<user0> A good suggestion for you . You need a holiday .
<user1> It wasn't always like this , you know .
<user0> What do you mean ?
<user1> Well , I mean . We always do the same thing . There's no variety in our lives .
<user0> You need a holiday . That's what's the matter .
<user1> Certainly , perhaps .
<user1> Hey , Isabelle ...
<user0> Logan ! Why on earth are you hiding here ? White hat ! Come on ! Don't tell me you're the guy ! It can't be true .
<user1> Yes , I am the guy .
<user0> What a bummer ! You set me up ?
<user1> Let me explain . I didn't mean to hurt you ...
<user0> How dare you ! ( starts to walk off )
<user1> Hang on one second . Hear me out , just this once , Isabella !
<user0> Why did you lie to me in the email ?
<user1> I didn't lie . You just didn't ask me my real name .
<user0> I should have known it was you . No wonder all the 20 questions were answered correctly . I thought I might have found the one for me .
<user1> I'm sorry . It was cruel of me . But I promise it will never happen again ? Look , there's a nice restaurant . Let me take you to dinner and we can talk things over .
<user1> Well , I swim and run every day .
<user0> Now , tell me , what do you eat ?
<user1> Well , I don't eat any meat , but I do eat fish and eggs .
<user0> Do you eat a lot of vegetables ?
<user1> Oh yes , and fruit , I love fruit .
<user0> What do you drink ?
<user1> Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . They are very bad for you .
<user0> What do you drink ?
<user1> Yeah .
<user0> Who won ?
<user1> China .
<user0> What was the score ?
<user1> China beat Brazil 3 to 0 .
<user0> Wonderful !
<user1> I wouldn't be so sure ... People want to wear what they feel most comfortable in .
<user0> Maybe that's true for some positions , but I think the marketing and sales staff would definitely not agree . They dress for success ! You can't go out on a sales call if you are dressed in jeans . It's just not respectful to you client .
<user1> I think what you wear is so overrated . I would rather have a down-to-earth , honest and solid sales person than a painted , patent leather , designer suite salesman .
<user0> It's not as simple as that . People judge you by your appearance , whether you like it or not . So dressing professional is being professional . The image that you portray to others is so important in business . It's your image and how others perceive you that makes the difference between landing or losing a sale .
<user1> Maybe you're right , but I'll take my sneakers and jeans any day !
<user1> What do you mean ?
<user0> I mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us .
<user1> Yes , look over there . That's the Empire State Building . My book says it's 102 stories tall .
<user0> It's quite famous but don't you think it looks a bit old-fashioned ?
<user1> You're right , but when it was built in 1930 it was a marvel of technology and engineering .
<user0> What other important buildings are we going to see on Fifth Avenue ?
<user1> Quite a number . Actually every skyscraper has a history . A few blocks ahead we'll see St.Patrick ' s Cathedral and just across the street will be the world-renowed Rockefeller Center . It's a landmark in the history of architecture .
<user0> What's there after that ?
<user1> Well then , there's a Central Park . Facing the park on Fifth Avenue is probably some of the most expensive properties in the world .
<user0> What are they all for ?
<user1> Most of them are office buildings , huge department stores , and hotels but some are just private homes . New York is one of the financial centers of the world . And there are lots of very expensive places .
<user1> I needed to get out of the house . My parents just went ballistic over something my older sister told them .
<user0> What did she tell them ? Is she dropping out of college ?
<user1> Nothing that serious . She finally told them that she moved out of the dormitory a few months ago and has been living with her boyfriend .
<user0> And your parents took it badly ?
<user1> That's putting it mildly . My father started shouting at my sister and my mother just glared at her .
<user0> Ouch , that sounds bad . What did your sister do ?
<user1> She started arguing back to my dad that how much she loves her boyfriend , how they're in love and it's not hurting anybody , and so on . My dad said she's too young to do this , and that she should move out right away .
<user0> How long has your sister been with her boyfriend ?
<user1> Three years . They've been dating since freshman year . They're even talking about marriage .
<user0> Really ? Then I guess living together would be a good idea .
<user1> What do you mean ?
<user0> Well , these days too many people are getting divorced . If they live together , then at least they're finding out if they're really compatible or not .
<user1> I guess so . Better to find out now than after you're married , when it's harder to get out .
<user1> Yeah , you can count on it .
<user0> I think so . Yes , they get along so well .
<user1> I like him . He's good for her .
<user0> You're right . He sure is .
<user1> He is all right . But I think he seems to have no back bone .
<user0> Why do you say that ?
<user1> Whatever things get tough , he gives in .
<user1> Don't worry . We'll make it back to the camp site before dark .
<user0> I sure hope so .
<user1> Oh , we never speak Spanish in class ! Miss.Parker speaks to us only in English .
<user0> I suppose she's right . Does she speak English very slowly ?
<user1> Not always . Sometimes we don't understand her . Then she has to repeat what she said .
<user0> It must be interesting to study English .
<user1> Mario and I are the best students in the class . Miss.Parker says that my pronunciation is very good .
<user0> Is English pronunciation easy or difficult ?
<user1> Sometimes it's difficult . Some words look different from the way one pronounces them .
<user1> Yes . I like winter .
<user0> Me too .
<user1> It's snowing heavily . What about taking a walk ?
<user0> That's a good idea . Let's go !
<user1> What a heavy snow ! Look ! The water is frozen .
<user0> Take care ! Don't slip on the ground .
<user1> I've got it . I like the feeling of stepping on the ice .
<user0> Yes . Very wonderful .
<user1> There is a snowman over there .
<user0> How lovely it is !
<user1> Just tell him off .
<user1> Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O ' Neal , they are the Los Angeles Lakers ' star players .
<user0> Oh .
<user1> Wait a second . He shoots , he scores !
<user0> All right !
<user1> Here comes Jordan , though .
<user0> Wow , Michael Jordan ' s slam-dunks are beautiful things to watch .
<user1> Yeah . He ' s older , so he doesn ' t slam as much as he did when he was younger , but when he does , it ' s still amazing .
<user0> Which team do you think will win ?
<user1> The Lakers . Jordan is the only good player Washington has .
<user1> It's ok . What do you want to ask ?
<user0> Where should I go after I arrived at the university ?
<user1> The first place you should go is the International Center .
<user0> Why ?
<user1> You can get help there in dealing with the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service ; you can find Foreign Student Advisers .
<user0> What kind of role do foreign student advisers play ?
<user1> They'll discuss personal concerns , housing , adjustment , finances and other matters with you .
<user0> Can we get any more help at the International Center ?
<user1> Yes , a lot more . If you go there just before the beginning of the fall's semester , you can get your student ID and social security number there . They will keep your documents up-to-date . They will offer an orientation program for new comers . They will also help you contact your department and registration office .
<user0> I see . It must be worth going to .
<user1> Besides these , the center staff also works with community organizations which provide tours , home hospitality , speaking engagements and assistance for wives of foreign students . In cooperation with nationality clubs , student associations and other organizations , the International Center provides a varied program of cultural and social events throughout the year .
<user0> Wonderful . It is a home for foreign students .
<user1> It sure is . They also serve tea , coffee and refreshments . The Center staff members are also friendly and helpful . Everyone loves them .
<user1> I can hardly make ends meet these days .
<user0> same here . I have't brought any new clothes for three months .
<user1> my income remains the same but prices just continue to rise .
<user0> true . The news says that there is a general increase in the price of daily necessities .
<user1> definitely . I have to spend 300 yuan more on food every month .
<user0> the biggest price jump is for pork , so most people have to turn to chicken .
<user1> is that inflation ?
<user0> inflation is more than just the rising prices , I guess . But the central bank is warning about the risk of inflation .
<user1> has the government taken some measures to curb it ?
<user0> yes . The government has banned price hikes in some key industries like energy .
<user1> but I'm afraid the price hikes will spill over from food into other areas of the economy .
<user0> you said it . I think we should tighten our budget and cut our spending .
<user1> how ?
<user0> for a start , we can take the public transport to work . You know , running a car is a big expense .
<user1> sounds a good idea .
<user1> You shouldn't grab someone else's shirt . That's a foul .
<user0> Play is stopped when the person with the ball is touched .
<user1> You can touch them only between the shoulder and the knees .
<user0> The touchdown lines are there and there . OK , let's play !
<user1> Before we start , let's have a moment of silence for our fallen men .
<user1> Yeah , almost . But there is one thing .
<user0> What ?
<user1> I still wonder what privacy meant for Chinese people . I don't mean to say that there's no privacy in China , but ...
<user0> What is it ?
<user1> Some of my Chinese colleagues just share their personal stories in front of others .
<user0> That makes you feel uncomfortable ?
<user1> Yeah . we never do that in a public office .
<user0> Perhaps that's because we hold different ideas about privacy .
<user1> I have felt that . One day when i was in a queue , reading a newspaper story , the man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper I was holding .
<user0> Well , that's not rare . I've seen people reading at others ' newspaper while taking a metro or a bus .
<user1> Just stare at the newspaper holding in the hands of the one next to him ?
<user0> Yeah .
<user1> Oh , I'm shocked .
<user1> I took a lot of courses , such as Philosophy , Logic , Ethics , Aesthetics , etc .
<user0> Which course did you like best ?
<user1> I liked Aesthetics best . It is very impressive .
<user1> Certainly . What's the matter ?
<user0> I wonder if you often trade with others on the internet .
<user1> Sure . I often buy things or do business through it without going out to the physical stores .
<user0> Great ! It's just like viewless stores . But how can you shop or order on line or trade on line ?
<user1> That's simple . Just click the hyperlink , www.taobao.com or www . ebay.com , and you can see the specimen of the goods shown on the screen , and then you can place an order online with the sales company . And the goods will be delivered to your place .
<user0> Is the service charged ?
<user1> No . it's free .
<user0> Really . I'll get a computer at once .
<user1> It ' s so cool !
<user1> I ' m afraid this seat is taken .
<user0> Oh . is it . Thank you anyway .
<user1> You ' re welcome . Why don ' t you ask the conductor when he comes by ?
<user0> Thank you .
<user1> I feel eggplants are more nutritious .
<user0> But as a matter of fact , potatoes taste better .
<user1> Oh , that's how you see it .
<user1> Hmm ... I'll tell you what . I'll lend you four thousand dollars , but you have to pay me back next week .
<user0> It's a deal .
<user1> Alps , suppose .
<user0> Oh , yes , you like skiing .
<user1> Right .
<user1> You were showing respect and admiration for them .
<user0> I wish I were a hero .
<user1> Is he really ?
<user0> Yes , he is . He loves the girl very much .
<user1> Who is he marring ?
<user0> A girl he met on holiday in Spain , I think .
<user1> Have they set a date for the wedding ?
<user0> Not yet .
<user1> Does the class start again , Mam ?
<user0> Yes , but to the heath , this break has long enough .
<user1> Oh , breaktime flies .
<user0> Come on , baby . It ' s time now .
<user1> Mam , another minute , could I ?
<user0> Hurry up , little boy .
<user1> Yes , I like collecting things .
<user0> Oh , that ' s interesting , and but what kind of things ?
<user1> Several things , for example , Very coins , stamps , stones and so on .
<user0> Stones ? I know many people collecting coins and stamps but stones ?
<user1> Yes , stones .
<user0> well , I can ' t just imagine it .
<user1> Mary told me that she had seen you with John last night . I got to know the fact that you are playing the field .
<user0> Honey , cross my heart , I'v never looked at another woman since the first day I set my eyes on you ! Believe me , that's the truth .
<user1> yes . How about going out and enjoying the sunshine on the grass ?
<user0> great , let's go !
<user1> hey , darling , I think I might have a little heatstroke from being in the sun all day . I was so relaxed . It felt as if I were in another world .
<user0> exactly . You know , the sunshine and wind remind me of our honeymoon . You remember ? The island , the sound of the waves , the salty sea air and the sunshine ...
<user1> yes , it was wonderful but it's already been a year . How time flies !
<user0> why not go again to celebrate out one-year anniversary ? We can go to the same beach , stay in the same hotel and enjoy a dinner in the same restaurant .
<user1> are you kidding ? Can you afford it ? Do you think we can get a room on such short notice ?
<user0> never mind that , I'll take care of it . Are you available next week ?
<user1> yeah , I think so .
<user0> ok . I'll make the arrangements . It will be great .
<user1> wonderful ! I'll start packing our suitcases .
