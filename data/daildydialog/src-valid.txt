It is not surprising for one to have a crash on the other . __eou__ <user1> If we think positively , office love can be beneficial to company . __eou__ <user0> Beneficial ? I don ' t think so . If two employees get married , they will leave at the same time for a honeymoon , or later one of them will stay at home taking care of babies . If they break up , the company will probably have to relocate one of them to make the workplace more comfortable . By any means , the company must spare extra efforts to solve problems brought by an office dating .

Some good things you should try are cranberry juice , wild rice and yoghurt . __eou__ <user1> What's special about these things ? __eou__ <user0> Cranberry juice is very good for destroying harmful bacteria in your guts because it's very acidic . Wild rice is high in fibre so it's good for your guts and it's high in protein and minerals-I think it's also tastier than normal rice . Yoghurt's good because it's also rich in protein , vitamins and is also acidic . People have been making yoghurt for thousands of years and if you have it every day , your guts will be much more settled .

I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box . __eou__ <user1> That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there.Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks .

Some people spend half of the morning on the road . __eou__ <user0> That's true . But our staff meetings are very important , Arnold . I don't know how we can function without them . __eou__ <user1> I think they are important too.That ' s why I want people to have a better attitude about them . __eou__ <user0> I know a lot of people think the meetings aren't too useful . I'm aware of that . __eou__ <user1> Here's what I propose . I think we should meet once every two weeks , but meet for ninety minutes or more . __eou__ <user0> Well . __eou__ <user1> I also think the meetings should be more focused.And I would be willing to take responsibility for that . __eou__ <user0> You mean you want to run the meetings ? __eou__ <user1> No , not really run them . But I could help organize them . I could discuss meeting topics with you , and then prepare a schedule for each meeting . I could then send an e-mail to all the staff to explain the coming meeting.This way the meetings would become more focused , and people would prepare better . __eou__ <user0> Hmm . But we would meet every two weeks . __eou__ <user1> I really think it would work.The meetings could be longer , and better organized . __eou__ <user0> I am not against the idea , Arnold.It may really be more efficient , as you say . I'll tell you what we can do.Why don't we try your proposal for a month , and see how it works . __eou__ <user1> Excellent . I would be happy to get started on it .

<user0> Doctor , save my baby , please __eou__ <user1> What symptoms does he have ? __eou__ <user0> He has had a fever for one day . Just now at home , he had febrile convulsions with teeth and fists clenched and eyes turned up . We were at a loss what to do .

Just a high fever and convulsions , which results from a virus upper respiratory tract inflection . __eou__ <user0> Does he have to be admitted to hospital ? __eou__ <user1> No . No need for admission . I'll give the baby analgia nose drops to bring down the temperature first . Then I will give you a prescription . The pink tablets are used for his fever .
