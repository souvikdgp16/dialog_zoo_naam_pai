<user1> There is one . 5 blocks away from here ?
<user0> Well , that's too far.Can you change some money for me ?
<user1> Surely , of course . What kind of currency have you got ?
<user0> RIB .
<user1> How much would you like to change ?
<user0> 1000 Yuan.Here you are .
<user1> This is Mr Meng speaking , Michelle .
<user0> Oh , hello ! Sorry about that . I'm just calling to say that we've received your new Corporate Credit Card from HQ .
<user1> That was quick ! I wasn't expecting it until later this week .
<user0> Yes , our application procedures have speeded up since we started using the new fast-track system .
<user1> Shall I come in and collect it ?
<user0> Or we can send it to you . But if you would like to use it at the ATM , you'll need to wait for your PIN number .
<user1> Mmmm ... if I come in and collect it this afternoon , is there any way I could use it today ? Petty cash is getting low , so I need to draw some money .
<user0> As long as you bring your ID , etc , we can serve you over the counter . But you won't be able to use the ATM until your new PIN number arrives .
<user1> I see . Yes , that's fine . I'll be there at around 2:30 pm . See you later , and thanks .
<user1> As a reporter , he must have acute insight and language skills . At the same time , he must have good judgment , the respect for his job and tactical cooperation with others .
<user0> Can you work under pressure ? You know , people working here are all busy everyday since we're daily newspaper .
<user1> I think I've got used to work under pressure . I will adjust myself to the step of your newspaper quickly .
<user1> Good morning I'd like to mail this box of books to Taiwan .
<user0> OK , please put it on this scale.Airmail or by sea ?
<user1> How long does it take to reach Taiwan by sea ?
<user0> Usually about two month .
<user1> That's too long.How long does it take to reach Taiwan by airmail ?
<user0> About ten days .
<user1> Then how much is that by airmail ?
<user0> Let me see.It ' s 57 dollars , 20 cents , including tax .
<user1> That's a little bit expensive .
<user0> Although it's expensive to send it by airmail , it's quicker and safer than by sea .
<user1> I guess I have to send it by airmail .
<user0> Do you want to ensure the contents , Miss ?
<user1> Yes , please .
<user0> Please fill out this form , also please write the value of the items in this space .
<user1> OK .
<user1> Of course . Go straight ahead . Turn right at the next street . You'll see a tall , yellow building.The post office is on the first floor .
<user0> Do you mean that I go that way for one block , then turn right ?
<user1> Yes , you are right .
<user0> Is it far ?
<user1> No , It's only about five minutes ' walk .
<user0> Thank you very much .
<user1> It's my pleasure .
<user1> He's a bright boy , isn't he ?
<user0> But he always wimps out of difficulty .
<user1> Don't worry , he'll make good progress step by step .
<user1> What is that problem , sir ?
<user0> There are cockroaches in my room .
<user1> Are you sure , sir ? Flies I could believe , but cockroaches ?
<user0> I've counted nine different cockroaches , and I accidentally stepped on another one .
<user1> Sir , we run a spotless and cockroach-less hotel .
<user0> You dare to doubt me ?
<user1> I'm sorry , sir . Let me transfer you to my supervisor .
<user1> Why not ? It's my parking space .
<user0> I'm afraid not , sir .
<user1> Oh ? That's a surprise . Let me see ... D 0411 Our dog's birthday . Yes , I'm sure this my parking space !
<user0> But I saw a red car always parking here before .
<user1> Oh , we've just repainted our car . It was red .
<user0> Maybe . But the car of this space has a broken rearview mirror on the left .
<user1> Yeah . It used to . We got that fixed yesterday too .
<user0> Could you wait for a minute , sir ? I'd like to have a check .
<user1> Sure , go ahead .
<user0> Sorry , sir , my mistake . This is your parking space .
<user1> That's all right . It's not your fault .
<user1> I need to buy a new refrigerator today .
<user0> Were you looking at a particular refrigerator ?
<user1> I like that Kenmore refrigerator .
<user0> This particular refrigerator is a very good choice .
<user1> Tell me about it .
<user0> Not only is it affordable , but it comes with all the appliances .
<user1> What are the appliances .
<user0> It has an ice maker , water dispenser , and plenty of room on the inside .
<user1> I'd like to see it for myself .
<user0> Go right ahead .
<user1> I like what I see .
<user1> So what about the tennis racket ?
<user0> Look ! It's amazing . I can't wait to try it out !
<user1> How much did that end up costing you ?
<user0> Oh ... around twenty bucks . A bargain if you ask me . Look at the picture of her playing with it !
<user1> Hey , two for one . That's a super deal .
<user0> And here's her signature !
<user1> I'm looking for someone who works here , but I lost his business card . His name's Long or Sang or something like that .
<user0> Chang ?
<user1> Yeah , that sounds right .
<user0> There are about twenty people named Chang who work here . What department ?
<user1> Let me think ... accounting , finance , something like that .
<user0> Eric Chang in accounting ?
<user1> That's him !
<user0> I'll call him and tell him you're here .
<user1> I appreciate your help .
<user0> Would you like to have a seat over there ? It'll just be a minute . And can I have your name ?
<user1> Here's my card .
<user0> OK . I'll have him come up to get you .
<user1> Yes , that's right . We want as much info as possible before we agree to anything .
<user0> Yes , it's important to be all clued up before you enter into any agreement . To make full use of the Network Settlement Service and take advantage of the whole banking system , we provide internal fund transfers , account inquiry , agency clearing to name but a few .
<user1> So , do you think our corporation will be eligible for this ?
<user0> Yes , and it's extremely simple . All you need to do is make a Network Settlement Agreement with us .
<user1> Just a minute . I ' m putting on my clothes .
<user0> Have you taken the key to the door ?
<user1> Yes . Oh , dear , I can ' t find my hairbrushes . Can you help me ?
<user0> Where have you put it ?
<user1> I put it in the dressing room .
<user0> Are you sure ?
<user1> Yes , quite sure .
<user0> Then , have you looked downstairs ?
<user1> Yes , I ' Ve looked everywhere downstairs .
<user0> Look , dear . It ' s over there .
<user1> Where ?
<user0> On the floor .
<user1> I am just waiting for my friends . It won't be long .
<user0> Sir , the curb here is not for parking .
<user1> But I didn't see the sign , Ma ' am .
<user0> There is a sign at the corner of the street . When you turned in here , you should have seen it .
<user1> I didn't see it .
<user0> I am sorry , sir . I have to give you a ticket . You can appeal to the court within 14 days . You will avoid paying the fine if you can prove that you are not at fault .
<user1> Yes , I am . I always make a plan before I do anything .
<user0> Where do you want to be in 5 years ?
<user1> I don't want to have a specific title . I just want to enjoy what I am doing .
<user0> That sounds very reasonable .
<user1> It's the most important thing to me .
<user0> If you are hired , how long do you plan to stay with us ?
<user1> That obviously depends on how things go - - whether I'm suited to the firm and the firm to me .
<user0> Tell me about some of your recent goals and what you do to achieve them .
<user1> I want to put my knowledge and experience to use in a challenging position . In order to achieve this goal , I just want to work step by step .
<user0> What is your long-range objective ?
<user1> I haven't thought it over at all .
<user0> What do you think is the most important thing when looking for a job ?
<user1> I think the most important thing is the interest in the job .
<user1> Certainly . May I see your social security and your ID , please .
<user0> Here you are . I wonder how much interest can I earn from a current account .
<user1> Oh , current accounts don't pay out interest .
<user0> Why is that ?
<user1> It's primarily designed for business transactions . That is , writing checks to pay for bills , buying things and sending money . We won't expect a large amount of deposit in a current account .
<user0> I see . How do I draw money for my own use then ?
<user1> Good morning , Steven .
<user0> So , what's the status of our advertising campaign ?
<user1> It'll be a national campaign starting next week .
<user0> What style will the ads be ?
<user1> I suggest that we focus on slice of life , showing how you can beat the summer heat by biting into a cool ice-cream sandwich .
<user0> Sounds like a good idea . Will we have a new slogan ?
<user1> Definitely .
<user1> That's fine . You must try this dish .
<user0> Could you tell me how this thing is cooked ?
<user1> It's fish steamed and served with our special sauce .
<user0> Is it good ?
<user1> Sure . It's a most popular dish .
<user0> I think I'll try it , and give me some green salad together .
<user1> We have two dressings for salad . Which one would you like ?
<user0> What kind do you have ?
<user1> We have French and Thousand Island .
<user0> Make it Thousand Island .
<user1> Where will you go , sir ?
<user0> Friendship Hotel .
<user1> OK , it's not far from here .
<user0> I have something important to do , can you fast the speed ?
<user1> Sure , I'll try my best . Here we are .
<user0> How much should I pay you ?
<user1> The reading on the meter is 15 yuan .
<user0> Here's 20 yuan , keep the change .
<user1> Thank you very much .
<user1> Hi , Cindy . It ' s Michael Kurt . Is Mr . Johnson in ?
<user0> No , I ' m sorry , Mr . Kurt . He ' s stepped out for a bit . Would you like me to have him call you ?
<user1> Yeah , that ' ll be great . I ' m on extension 4283 .
<user1> Hi , Bill . I ' d like to take the apartment I looked at yesterday .
<user0> All right .
<user1> So , what do we do now ?
<user0> This is the lease . You should read the lease very carefully before you sign it because it describes your legal rights and responsibilities as a tenant . The lease also describes our rights and responsibilities as landlords .
<user1> Okay . ( Reads the lease ) So , according to the lease , I ' ll deposit one month ' s rent as a security deposit , and I have to pay the first month ' s rent in advance . I understand that I ' ll get the security deposit back when I move out if the apartment does not need any costly repairs .
<user0> Yes . If you do not damage the apartment , you will get your security deposit back when you move out .
<user1> Can I pay you by check ?
<user0> Sure . A check will be fine .
<user1> Is there a laundry room in the basement ?
<user0> Yes .
<user1> Can I sign the lease right now ?
<user1> I'm thinking of travelling to Suzhou in July . Could you recommend some tourist programs for that ?
<user0> With pleasure . We arrange two kinds of tourist programs for Suzhou , a six-day tour by train and a five-day flying journey .
<user1> How much does a six-day tour by train cost ?
<user0> Five hundred yuan .
<user1> Does that include hotels and meals ?
<user0> Oh , yes , and admission tickets for places of interest as well .
<user1> That sounds reasonable . What about the five-day flying journey ? How much is that ?
<user0> Eight hundred and fifty yuan .
<user1> Covering all expenses ?
<user0> Yes . But there is no half fare for children . They must pay full fare .
<user1> Of course not . I'm just observing casual day . On Fridays , the company doesn't require us to wear formal business attire .
<user0> Wow ! Nobody told me about that . Won't the relaxed dress code damage the company image ?
<user1> We don't think so . Casual days are becoming more common , and we believe employees can maintain a professional image without wearing uncomfortable clothes .
<user0> I guess it lets people express their individual tastes . But won't some people abuse it ?
<user1> Not really . Besides , there is a separate dress code for casual day . People can't just wear whatever they want .
<user0> It seems that a relaxed atmosphere could hinder productivity .
<user1> Believe it or not , it has the opposite effect . Employees are actually more productive on casual days .
<user1> Hello , Lucy , this is Monica . I ' m calling for the accountant position . I saw the information about the vacancy on your company ' s website . Is it still available ?
<user0> Thank you for your interest . The position is still available . Have you already sent your CV to us ?
<user1> No , not yet . First , I want to check about the availability and see if you could give more information .
<user0> It is urgent for us to fill this position now and I would like to stress that English is a must because of the international contacts and most likely traveling abroad very soon . If all these is not problem for you , I recommend you to mention these in your cover letter and send it to me directly .
<user1> The notification period of my current job is not that long and I ' m quite profession to English and I am happy with the traveling abroad as I ' m good dealing with the people from other cultures . It makes the whole job even more interesting . I will send my resume to you still this week .
<user1> Yes , do you have any rooms available ?
<user0> A single ?
<user1> No . I need a double and three triples . My family is waiting for me in the car .
<user0> Please fill out this form , sir .
<user1> Ok ... Here you are .
<user0> Here are your keys . Check out time is noon .
<user1> Is breakfast included ?
<user0> No .
<user1> I stayed home because I wasn't feeling well .
<user0> What was your problem ?
<user1> My stomach was bothering me .
<user0> Are you feeling any better ?
<user1> I'm still feeling a little sick .
<user0> I'm going to the store , would you like any Pesto Pistol ?
<user1> I'd appreciate that .
<user1> Including my keys ?
<user0> Yes , and please step over there .
<user1> All right . What shall I do now ?
<user0> Just open your bags so we can check them . After that you can pick them up right behind that X-ray machine .
<user1> I've got film in my bag .
<user0> That's all right . This machine will not damage the film .
<user1> That's fine .
<user0> Can I have your boarding pass ? We need to stamp it .
<user1> Sure . Here you are .
<user0> Thank you .
<user1> Am I through now ?
<user0> Yes . Here is your boarding pass .
<user1> Thank you and goodbye .
<user1> I ' d like extra prints made of these photos .
<user0> Do you have your negatives ?
<user1> Yes.Here they are . I ' Ve marked how many prints I want on each shot .
<user0> What size do you want the prints ?
<user1> Four by six , except this one . I want a ten by thirteen print of this one .
<user0> Okay , they ' ll be ready for you in an hour .
<user1> I'm interested in taking a tour to Sydney .
<user0> Well , we have a package tour there .
<user1> How much does it cost ?
<user0> $ 600 .
<user1> Does that include the insurance ?
<user0> Of course .
<user1> Like wise . Take a seat , please . How about a cup of tea ?
<user0> Sure . Thank you . It seems your business is prosperous . There are many customers here .
<user1> Yes , it's not too bad . Our sales are going up year after year . And we still have a large potential production capacity .
<user0> Well , what do you think of choosing a commission representative or agent abroad to promote your sales ?
<user1> That's a good idea . So far , we have several agents abroad .
<user0> We are willing to be your agent in Thailand for hand-held tools . What do you think ?
<user1> That sounds good .
<user0> Then , what's your usual commission rate for your agents ?
<user1> Usually , we give a commission of 4 % to our agents .
<user0> 4 % is too low , I think . You see , we have a lot of work to do in sales promotion , such as advertising on radio or TV , printing booklets , leaflets , catalogues and so on . It all costs money , 4 % is not enough .
<user1> Don't worry . We'll allow you a higher commission rate if your sales score a substantial increase .
<user0> You mean to saya
<user1> It sounds OK . Then how do you pay the commission ?
<user0> We may deduct the commission from the invoice value directly or remit it to you after payment .
<user1> All right . If it's okay , we would like to sign an agency agreement with you immediately .
<user0> Think it over . We hope to keep a good business relationship with you .
<user1> Thank you for your help .
<user1> I'm sorry . These batteries are not on sale .
<user0> But that's what the ad said .
<user1> I'm sorry . If you look at the ad again , you'll see that the other brand is on sale .
<user0> Oh . You're right . I misread the ad .
<user1> Yes , many people make that mistake .
<user0> Well , you can't blame them . It's a confusing ad .
<user1> You're right . Many ads are like that .
<user0> Well , as long as I'm here .
<user1> Just one second , and I'll give you the batteries that are on sale .
<user1> I don't have a girlfriend . I'm single .
<user0> Oh , that's right . Well , there are going to be many beautiful girls at the party tonight , anyway .
<user1> No , I like being single . I never thought lonely , I'm focus on my career . Maybe I'll start to look for my girl when I achieve success .
<user0> Why is that ?
<user1> Because I'm living a real world , a man enriched have a good career and make a lot of money . Franklin speaking the girls I've met wounldn't married a man wounldn't make enough money .
<user0> I agree , a man needs good career.But that doesn't mean he should have a little fun , too .
<user1> Yeah , I ' Ve been meaning to talk to you about that . I might need to ask for an extension on that deadline .
<user0> You ' Ve had over a month to get this finalized ! Why are things delayed ?
<user1> Well , the thing is , we ran into a lot of problems . . .
<user0> I ' m not looking for excuses here . I just want to get this finished on time !
<user1> I know , and I apologize for the delay . But some things were just beyond my control . I had trouble booking the photographer , and then Michael was sick for three weeks , so I couldn ' t include him in the photos , and the design team lost all the files , so I had to re-do the pictures .
<user0> I ' m not going to put this off any longer , Casey ! I want those photos ASAP !
<user1> Can I have Mr . J . Smith paged ? He said he'd be in the main dining room . I'm Mr . J . B . White .
<user0> Who would you like to have paged again , sir ?
<user1> Mr . J . Smith .
<user0> Where would you like him to come ?
<user1> To the front desk .
<user0> Just a moment , please .
<user1> That ' s what I am here for . What questions can I answer for you ?
<user0> I have poison oak , and I need help with the rash that won ' t stop itching .
<user1> The best product is Techne , and you can buy either the lotion or cream .
<user0> Which one is best ?
<user1> The cream form is very popular .
<user0> Can I do anything else to help with the itching ?
<user1> You could also take an antihistamine to help the rash go away quicker .
<user0> I appreciate you helping me find a solution to the itching .
<user1> Anytime you have a question , please feel free to ask .
<user1> Yes . What's the problem ?
<user0> Just a mistake with my name . It should be issued as Steven , but the card is under the name ' Steven ' .
<user1> Oh , I am very sorry about that . It's our fault . I will arrange someone to correct it immediately .
<user0> OK , no problem . To err is human .
<user1> Anyway , we apologize for the inconvenience we have brought you . Please just wait for a moment , and it will be fixed .
<user0> Thank you very much .
<user1> Whose name did you pick ?
<user0> I got Jacob . Any ideas what to get him ?
<user1> Booze !
<user0> Yeah , you ' re right . Can ' t go wrong with that .
<user1> No , the steak was recommended , but it is not very fresh .
<user0> Oh , sorry to hear that . This is quite unusual . I will look into the matter .
<user1> This is very annoying .
<user0> I'm sorry , sir . Do you wish to try something else ? That would be on the house , of course .
<user1> No , I don't risk it .
<user0> How about a delicious dessert then , with our compliment ?
<user1> I'm not keen on dessert as a habit . They are fattening .
<user0> I see , sir . I'm sure everything will be right next time you come .
<user1> No , I'm Mary .
<user0> Oh , are you in Class Four ?
<user1> No , I'm in Class There .
<user1> There's an airsickness bag behind the seat that's in front of you .
<user0> I must've missed it .
<user1> Is this your first time flying ?
<user0> Yes . I'm going to San Francisco .
<user1> Oh , it's a beautiful city . I think you'll like it .
<user0> Hey , I'm feeling much better already .
<user1> Sometimes if you don't think about it , that sick feeling will go away on its own .
<user0> Thanks . By the way , my name is Mary .
<user1> I'm Frank . Nice to meet you .
<user1> Hi ! Let me get a dozen croissants , four blueberry muffins and a loaf of sourdough bread .
<user0> Sure . Would you like to have the loaf sliced ?
<user1> No , that's OK . Do you have any whole wheat bread ?
<user0> We are out at the moment . May I suggest some rye bread ?
<user1> Sure that sounds good . Do you have any cakes ?
<user0> We have various birthday cakes and also ice cream cakes .
<user1> I'll just take a cheesecake .
<user0> Will that be all ?
<user1> Yes .
<user0> Your total is forty three dollars and twenty cents .
<user1> Thank you , Mr . Jackson , ladies and gentlemen , colleagues , friends . The subject of my talk is international relations in a morgen world . I plan to say a few words about the current situation in the Middle East and how it affects world economy . I'd like to give you an overview of the way that the economies of seemingly unrelated countries are intertwined . I've divided my talk into three parts , first an overview of international relations , second a discussion of current political situations , and lastly trends for the future . My presentation will take about two hours , but there will be a twenty-minute break in the middle . We'll stop for lunch at 12 .
<user1> I couldn't sleep well recently .
<user0> You'd get plenty of sleep for you work so hard .
<user1> I always drink too much wine in the evening .
<user0> You shan't drink more wine in the evening .
<user1> Yes , you are right .
<user0> And you'd take some exercise every day .
<user1> Many thanks for your advice .
<user1> Hello Dr Peters . Just fine thank you . Ricky and I are here for his vaccines .
<user0> Very well . Let's see , according to his vaccination record , Ricky has received his Polio , Tetanus and Hepatitis B shots . He is 14 months old , so he is due for Hepatitis A , Chickenpox and Measles shots .
<user1> What about Rubella and Mumps ?
<user0> Well , I can only give him these for now , and after a couple of weeks I can administer the rest .
<user1> OK , great . Doctor , I think I also may need a Tetanus booster . Last time I got it was maybe fifteen years ago !
<user0> We will check our records and I'll have the nurse administer and the booster as well . Now , please hold Ricky's arm tight , this may sting a little .
<user1> Great . Are you a qualified teacher ?
<user0> Yes .
<user1> What kind of teaching certificate do you have ?
<user0> I have a TEFL certificate .
<user1> How many years of experience do you have ?
<user0> I have three years of teaching ESL and four years of teaching per-school children .
<user1> When did you get your TEFL certificate ?
<user0> I got my TEFL certificate three years ago .
<user1> Why do you want to teach at our school ?
<user0> Well , I ' Ve heard many good things about it . I also like teaching young children .
<user1> That ' s great . Can you speak Chinese ?
<user0> Yes , just a little .
<user1> Can you come in for an interview tomorrow at 10:00 ?
<user0> I sure can .
<user1> Great . See you then .
<user1> What's going on ?
<user0> Look . Two cars are standing right in the middle of the road and the drivers are shouting rude words to each other . That's why that car stops .
<user1> More and more people easily get irritated while driving .
<user0> Yes . This is what is called road rage .
<user1> That ' s great . What are the prizes ?
<user0> 3000 RIB as bonus for each person .
<user1> To encourage the staff increases .
<user0> Ok . Next thing is laying the corner-stone for the new plant at 10 AM . At 12 AM , back here for lunch .
<user1> What about the afternoon ?
<user0> At 2 PM , give a presentation here with the press . At four o ' clock sharp , have dinner with Mr . Smith , manager of NCC .
<user1> Ah , hello . I'm calling to find out how I apply for a car loan .
<user0> We offer a Personal Automobile Consumer Loan . The application process is pretty straight forward . I trust you have enough funds to cover the 20 % down payment ?
<user1> Yes , I do . It's ready and waiting in my account .
<user0> The next step is for us to recommend a dealer to you , who are already contracted to us , so ...
<user1> Could I just stop you there ? Sorry to interrupt , but I have already been to your appointed dealer and selected the car I want .
<user0> That will certainly cut down the processing time . We can move on to the next step . Do you have the purchase price ?
<user1> Yes , it's 110,000 RIB . So , with the down payment done , I will need to borrow 70,000 RIB .
<user0> What we need you to do next is to come into the branch with a correctly filled in application form , ID card , proof of residency , proof of income , the agreement from the agent and of course the 20 % down payment .
<user1> Yes , I have everything here . OK , I'll come in and see you later today . Maybe I could have my new car as early as next week ! How exciting !
<user1> Tom , the new sales representative ? Nice to meet you ! I'm Melinda .
<user0> Nice to meet you too.Melinda .
<user1> Now let me show you around . This is our reception area , and our conference room is right over there . Over here is the sales department .
<user0> Really ? This is a nice office , but it's quite small .
<user1> Yeah ... You can make photocopies and send faxes over there .
<user0> It looks like you guys work hard .
<user1> I tell you what just between you and me , we just mess things up so that it looks like we work hard.Just kidding . Oh , your cubicle is over the . And this way . Those are all private offices the managers offices .
<user0> Hmm ... Tell me more details about our jobs .
<user1> Sure thing .
<user1> Your price has gone up sharply , hasn't it ?
<user0> Yes . We regret we cannot maintain our original price . Since the prices of the raw materials have been raised , we have to adjust the price of our products accordingly .
<user1> I agree with you there , but your price is unreasonable .
<user0> I don't think so . You must compare our price with that of other export houses . I'm sure our offer is in line with the prevailing market price level .
<user1> I don't think we'll be able to pay the price . To have this business concluded , you need to lower your price at least by 3 % .
<user0> I ' m afraid that there is no room for any reduction in price .
<user1> Don't you agree with me that in the long run , moderate prices will bring about large sales and more profit ?
<user0> We've already cut down our price to cost level .
<user1> Is that all ?
<user0> Yes , this is the best we can do .
<user1> I'm sorry we can't handle the price you offered .
<user1> It ' s great , dad . I don ' t mind delivering papers , but the real fun is collecting the money .
<user0> Even though you are only twelve , it ' s not too early to start saving a little money .
<user1> I ' Ve never had a bank account before . Why don ' t I just keep my money under the matters like grandpa does ?
<user0> You know you would spend it . And also , money in the bank earns interest .
<user1> But what if I need my money suddenly ?
<user0> The bank will give you a PIN , and you can withdraw money from any ATM .
<user1> Great ! So it ' s almost the same as keeping it under the matters !
<user0> Not quite . You have to maintain a minimum balance of twenty dollars . And sometimes the bank has service charges . But you don ' t have to worry about that yet . Let ' s go make your first depot
<user1> OK . Guess I have to do that before . I can make money my first withdrawal .
<user1> Yes , but you can't get there with out a change .
<user0> Which bus do I have to change ?
<user1> You have to get off at the hospital and change for bus 15 .
<user0> I see . Thank you .
<user1> Oh , how splendid ! Can you take a picture of me here ?
<user0> Sure .
<user1> We are here , bus station , we are in the heart of the city .
<user0> Oh ! Can I go from here to the Zhongshan Park ?
<user1> Head straight up the street about two blocks then turn right .
<user1> Working hours are from 8: 30 a . m . to 5:00 p . m . Be sure not to be late or absent . Report to the manager by filling in the ' Monthly Report ' every month .
<user0> Is there anything else ? How about my salary ?
<user1> Our company has a strict and reasonable salary standard . On the 20th day of every month , you can get your salary on time . Benefits depend upon the length of service and the employee's past attendance record .
<user0> Wow , thank you for telling me these . Do you mind telling me something else , like attendance record , holiday , and how to ask for leave ?
<user1> All new members are likely to ask the same questions . Haha . I can understand that . Every month you have three days off , besides the weekends and some important holidays . After you've been here for a year , you qualify for a one-week vacation . The leave less than a half-day should predict for an hour , and more than a half-day should predict three days .
<user0> Okay , that's good . I get it .
<user1> What do you mean ?
<user0> Masha and Hero are getting divorced .
<user1> You are kidding . What happened ?
<user0> Well , I don't really know , but I heard that they are having a separation for 2 months , and filed for divorce .
<user1> That's really surprising . I always thought they are well matched . What about the kids ? Who get custody ?
<user0> Masha , it seems quiet and makable , no quarrelling about who get the house and stock and then contesting the divorce with other details worked out .
<user1> That's the change from all the back stepping we usually hear about . Well , I still can't believe it , Masha and Hero , the perfect couple . When would they divorce be final ?
<user0> Early in the New Year I guess .
<user1> I would like to make a collect call to Taipei , Taiwan , please .
<user0> Your name , please .
<user1> Tim Chen .
<user0> What's the number , please .
<user1> The area code is 2 , and the number is 2367-9960 .
<user0> The line is connected . Please go ahead .
<user1> Yes . Can I help you ?
<user0> Do you remember me ? I just had lunch here a half hour ago .
<user1> Of course I remember you .
<user0> I think I lost my wallet here .
<user1> Oh , no . Really ? I didn't see anything .
<user0> Really ? You didn't find a wallet ?
<user1> No , I didn't . Would you like to go look by the table with me ?
<user0> Yes , I would . It's not here . And it's not on the floor.Has anyone sat at this table since we left ?
<user1> No . It's been empty the whole time .
<user0> Hmm . I don't know how it could have happened .
<user1> I remember , sir , that your friend took the bill.You didn't pay for the lunch yourself , did you ?
<user0> No . My friend did .
<user1> Then are you sure you took your wallet out of your pocket while you were here ?
<user0> No , I'm not sure . But I usually take out my wallet when I sit down.It ' s uncomfortable to sit on it . So I usually put it next to me on the table .
<user1> Maybe you lost it before you came here . Or maybe you left it at home .
<user0> I don't think it's at home . I think I had it when I left the house.But what should I do ?
<user1> Well , the first thing you should do is make sure it's not at home.Then , if it isn't , you need to call your credit card companies and cancel your cards . Next , you need to replace whatever you lost , your driver's license , things like that .
<user0> Should I call the police ?
<user1> You can if you want . But the police usually don't do anything about lost wallets .
<user0> Hmm . I'll go home and check . Maybe you're right . Maybe it's at home .
<user1> I'm sorry we couldn't find it , sir .
<user0> Thanks for your help .
<user1> Yes . Many things ! I especially love this beautiful quilt .
<user0> That quilt was passed down to me from my ma in Holland .
<user1> It sounds like a special quilt . Why do you want to sell it ?
<user0> Well , this home is too big for me now , so I'm moving to an apartment that is much smaller . Therefore , I need to part with a few things .
<user1> Oh , I see . Umm , how much do you want for the quilt ?
<user0> Is fifteen dollars OK ?
<user1> Let me see .
<user1> I ' d rather you didn ' t , Miss Yang . I ' m very busy now .
<user0> Can I try later then ?
<user1> Yes , of course .
<user0> Is it all right for me to come in now , Mr Sun ?
<user1> Well , uh ... I ' m still pretty busy , but ... all right . Come in . What can I do for you ?
<user0> Do you mind if I sit down ?
<user1> Not at all . Take a seat . Now what can I do for you ?
<user0> I want to leave the department . Do you think I could put info a transfer ?
<user1> Yes . But why should you want to do that ?
<user0> Do you mind if I speak frankly ?
<user1> Not at all . Go ahead .
<user0> Well . You see , I don ' t like the office . I don ' t like the staff . And I ' m afraid of you . And I don ' t want to go one . So may I put info a transfer ?
<user1> Yes . I ' d be delighted if you did .
<user1> Take me to the airport , please .
<user0> Are you in a hurry ?
<user1> I have to be there before 17 o'clock .
<user0> We'll make it except a jam . You know it's rush hour .
<user1> There's an extra ten in it for you if you can get me there on time .
<user0> I'll do my best .
<user1> Here's twenty dollars .
<user0> Do you have small bills ?
<user1> No . If you can't break it , keep the change . But can you give me a receipt ?
<user0> Here is your receipt . Thank you .
<user1> When did you last time have your eyes checked ?
<user0> Two years ago . At that time I had no problems.Now I can ' t even make out something ten meters away .
<user1> Come over here . I will test your eyes . First cover your left eye like this , and when I point , please read the chart from the top , and go as far as you can , telling me which way the “ E ” points .
<user0> All right .
<user1> Good.Now the other eye .
<user0> Well , this one is worse .
<user1> Never mind , just read as far as you can .
<user0> I can only read the first three lines .
<user1> Yes , there is an underground car park near the supermarket .
<user0> I see . Thanks .
<user1> What's up , Bro ? What's in the bulletin ?
<user0> It says that there will be a blackout from 5 p . m . to 7 p . m . in our neighborhood today .
<user1> Blackout ? Even the TV has the limit .
<user0> Don't you know you will look like a monster in the blackout ?
<user1> Oops , no , Daddy can't watch American Idol , either !
<user0> That's not the point . Come on , can you imagine that there will be no electricity on such a hot day ?
<user1> Oh , my god ! No air-conditioner !
<user0> OK , since you are the smart one , can you come up with a better plan ? So that we won't be baked like cookies here .
<user1> How about playing Barbie out there in the neighborhood ?
<user0> Barbie ? You know , I might be seven , but I'm not a girl .
<user1> Do you have a better plan ?
<user0> All right , all right .
<user1> I am wondering if you do facial care ?
<user0> Yes , we do .
<user1> How much would it be ?
<user0> From 200 to 800 .
<user1> I'm afraid 800 is too expensive for me . Could you recommend something around 300 ?
<user0> No problem .
<user1> I would like to order 2 office-style cabinets and desk calendars . We want office-style cabinets in white . The catalogue number is 90 - f - 2356 .
<user0> How soon do you want it ?
<user1> Could you deliver it tomorrow ?
<user0> No problem .
<user1> Please handle the items carefully .
<user0> Certainly .
<user1> We will pay by collect on delivery .
<user1> Does it have to be this afternoon , Mr . Fairbanks ? I ' Ve already made plans .
<user0> Well , I would have preferred to do it today , but if you ' Ve already made plans , we can do it tomorrow .
<user1> I ' d appreciate that , sir . How long do you think you ' ll need me to stay ?
<user1> The buck stops here .
<user1> Well , Administrative assistant with shorthand and typing skills are badly needed here .
<user0> First I want to check about the availability and see if you could give me more information .
<user1> The position calls for a person with some working experience . We must be able to benefit from your analytical and interpersonal skills . Can you deliver your resume to us first ?
<user0> Of course . I will deliver my resume to you in minutes ' time . I hope you will consider my application and I shall appreciate a reply at your earliest convenience .
<user1> OK . I will call you soon . Bye now .
<user0> Bye .

<user1> Hi , Deborah ! This is John . I'm calling from Australia .
<user0> What are you doing in Australia ?
<user1> I'm attending a conference in Sydney this week . Remember ?
<user0> Oh , right . What time is it there ?
<user1> It's 10:00 P . M . And it's four o'clock in Los Angeles , right ?
<user0> Yes - four o'clock in the morning .
<user1> 4:00 A . M . ? I'm really sorry .
<user0> That's OK . I'm awake now .
<user1> I'm afraid not , we're very short-staffed at the moment . Can you ask the shift supervisor to ask one of his team to do some overtime ? Perhaps Tommy can stand in for an hour or two until we find a replacement .
<user1> Oh , you are out of breath ! What happened ?
<user0> Some people are wildly shooting on the next street . We must leave here as soon as possible !
<user1> Take it easy . They will get caught .
<user1> Sorry , but he is out for lunch right now .
<user0> I see . Can you give me some idea how long he'll be back ?
<user1> I think he will be back around 2:00 . If you like , please leave your name and phone number , I'll have him call you as soon as he comes back .
<user0> That's nice . My name is Steven , my phone number is 6789777 . Okay , I'll be waiting for his call . Thank you and bye !
<user1> My pleasure , bye !
<user1> What can I do for you ?
<user0> I've just heard an announcement that my flight has been delayed .
<user1> What's your flight number ?
<user0> Flight CA216 to Chengdu .
<user1> Yes , it's true . It has been delayed .
<user0> Could you please tell me why ?
<user1> Yes , of course . The delay is due to heavy rain .
<user0> How long will the delay be ? Do you have any further information about it ?
<user1> I am sorry , we don't know the extent of the delay at present . But according to the latest weather forecast , there will be a change in weather soon .
<user0> We have to wait . Well , is it possible for the rain to stop before noon ?
<user1> It's hard to say . Weather is so changeable in the summer . Please listen to the latest announcement about your flight .
<user0> Yes , I will . Thanks a lot . Bye !
<user1> Bye
<user1> I'm worried , Tom . I haven't seen any other cars for almost an hour .
<user0> I know . This is terrible . What can we do ? This snow doesn't stop falling !
<user1> I told you we should have stayed in town today.The weather report said 100 percent chance of snow.Why did you want to come up here ?
<user0> I wanted to show you the cabin . We only had another half-hour to go .
<user1> Well , now we're stuck . What can we do ?
<user0> I don't know .
<user1> I've heard that when this happens , it's important to save energy .
<user0> What do you mean ?
<user1> We're stranded here , Tom . We may be here a long time.We need to conserve the gas in the car . The car's energy is what will keep us warm .
<user0> I have plenty of gas .
<user1> Yes , but the gas and the battery both have to stay working.We can't just let the car run and run.If we do , it will die soon . Then we'll freeze .
<user0> So what can we do ?
<user1> Turn the lights off.Then , run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour.That will conserve the heat as long as possible .
<user0> Alright . That's a good idea .
<user1> I wish we hadn't come up here . Now we'll probably be here for days .
<user0> Days ?
<user1> Yes , it happens.That is what happens in big snowstorms . People get stranded for days .
<user0> Oh , my God ! It's good we have food .
<user1> Probably we'll survive.But turn the car off for about forty-five minutes . Then we'll turn it on again .
<user1> Oh , sorry . I didn ' t know .
<user0> What ? You haven ' t taken the bus before ?
<user1> No , I ' m afraid not .
<user0> Well , you have to wait in line like everyone else . Besides , you should let old people on first .
<user1> Sorry .
<user0> It ' s all right . Where are you going ?
<user1> I wanted to see the White House .
<user0> Oh , well you don ' t want this bus , anyway . It goes to Georgetown .
<user1> Oh , no .
<user0> It ' s all right , though . Just get off at the next stop and catch the 79A .
<user1> Oh , well thank you very much .
<user0> You ' re welcome .
<user1> I'd like the double cheese burger meal , please .
<user0> What kind of drink would you like with that ?
<user1> Just coke will be fine .
<user0> Would you like a super size meal ? Only 2 RIB more , you'll get large coke and fries instead of medium . And today we are offering free toys all the meal boxes .
<user1> That sounds good , thanks , I'd like that . Actually I'd like sprite instead of coke , thanks .
<user0> That's not a problem , Miss . Will that be it ?
<user1> Yes , that's all .
<user0> That will be 25RMB , please
<user1> You got it .
<user1> Yes , we will depart in 10 minutes .
<user0> Is that a guided tour ?
<user1> Yes , it is .
<user0> That's fine . Let's get on the bus .
<user1> That's nice .
<user0> We hope this matter will not affect our good relations in our future dealings .
<user1> Of course not . We have cooperated for a long time .
<user1> What kind of meat would you like to get today ?
<user0> First off , I'm going to need a pound of ground beef .
<user1> A pound of ground beef is $ 2.48 .
<user0> That's perfect .
<user1> What else will you be needing ?
<user0> I'm also going to need three pounds of chicken breasts .
<user1> The chicken breasts cost $ 4.05 per pound .
<user0> What's the total price for the chicken ?
<user1> It's going to be $ 12.15 .
<user0> Okay , I think that will be all for me today .
<user1> Yes , Mr . Bergeron . You mentioned that in your letter . To tell you the truth , your proposal surprised us .
<user0> Is that so ? Anyhow I want to go over the details with you in person , so you can give my suggestion thorough consideration . Our firm specializes in this line of business . We have six sales representatives , who are on the road all the time , covering the whole of the European market .
<user1> Do you sell direct to shops ?
<user0> Yes , we specialize in handling clocks and watches of all sorts . We have well established channels of distribution and we canvass the retailers direct , without any middlemen .
<user1> Do you keep a stock of these things ?
<user0> In some cases , such as the wristwatches , which always have a steady market , we keep a stock in London and act as distributors as well as agents . Generally , however , we pass on the orders of our clients to the manufacturers for supply . We are paid for our service , of course .
<user1> That is , your commission .
<user0> Yes , our commission is very reasonable . We usually get a 10 % commission of the amount on every deal .
<user1> Our agents in other areas usually get a 3-5 % commission .
<user0> The European market is not familiar with your products . You have competitors from Japan and other continental countries . At the beginning of our campaign , there is sales resistance to overcome , we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news - papers and TV programs . A 10 % commission will not leave us much .
<user1> According to your estimate , what is the maximum annual turn - over you can fulfill , in round figures , of course ?
<user0> We will always do our utmost to enlarge the business , as our remuneration increases with the turnover , but we will not guar - ante anything , at least not to begin with .
<user1> We appreciate very much your intention to push the sale of our products . But our suggestion to you , Mr . Bergeron , as a preliminary step , is to do a little research into the market ...
<user0> Do you mean to say you refuse us the agency ?
<user1> Mr . Bergeron , you leave us no alternative . We can not give you an exclusive agency of the whole European market without having the slightest idea of your possible annual marketing turnover . Besides our price is worked out according to the costing . A 10 % commission means an increase in our price . We must have the reaction of the buyers in this respect .
<user0> Oh , that's just too bad . I intended to make great efforts in selling your products .
<user1> Well , we can still carry on our business relationship without the agreement . To start the ball rolling , we will provide you with price lists , catalogues and some samples . Only when you have a thorough knowledge of the marketing possibilities of our products , can we then discuss further details .
<user0> Ah , Mrs . Miller , but in this case am I covered ?
<user1> Oh , yes . We will give you a 5 % commission on every transaction .
<user0> All right , but I'll be back again for the Autumn Fair . And then I hope we can see eye to eye about our commission and the terms of the agency .
<user1> Very good . We will discuss the matter again at the next Fair .
<user1> Yes , Mr . Ransom ? This is Karl Miller . How may I help you ?
<user0> Well , I wonder if you could track an order I placed with you last month . It hasn ' t arrived yet .
<user1> Certainly , Ms . Ransom . Do you have an order number ?
<user1> Yes , we have . Here's our CIF quotation sheet . Please have a careful look .
<user0> Are the prices on the list firm offers ?
<user1> Yes . All the quotations on the list are subject to our final confirmation .
<user0> I wonder whether there are any changes in your prices .
<user1> All these products are our best-selling lines . The prices of our products will change according to that of the international market demand . And we are always open to negotiate , especially on larger orders . What do you have in mind ?
<user0> How long does your offer remain valid ? I need some time to get my supervisors on board with this plan .
<user1> I understand . Our offer remains open for 4 days .
<user1> Yeah , I accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet .
<user0> I see . Well , you have come to the right place . We have over one hundred models of more than twenty leading mobile phone manufacturers .
<user1> Sounds good . I don ' t want it to be too expensive , maybe something mid-range .
<user0> We have this new ETC smart phone.It comes with the Android OS so you can download applications . It also has a built-in camera , mp3 player and touch screen . It works on the 3G network so you have fast access to the internet wherever you are .
<user1> What about Wi-fi ?
<user0> Of course ! You can access the internet from any hotspot as well as from home .
<user1> One last thing . Is it waterproof ?
<user1> Why not ? Come on ! Just a cute little puppy or a kitty !
<user0> Who is going to look after a dog or a cat ?
<user1> I will ! I ' ll feed it , bathe it and walk it every day ! We can get a Labrador or a German Shepard !
<user0> What if we want to take a vacation ? Who will we leave it with ? Plus , our apartment is too small for that breed of dog .
<user1> Ok . How about we get a cat or a ferret ?
<user0> We ' re planning on having children soon , I don ' t think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house .
<user1> Fine ! Let ' s get a bird then ! We can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk ! A parrot would be awesome !
<user0> I ' ll tell you what , I can get you some hamsters and we ' ll take it from there .
<user1> Yay !
<user1> Overbooked ? Give up my seat ? I don ' t understand .
<user0> From time to time we have a situation in which there are more passengers than there are seats on the aircraft . That ' s overbooked .
<user1> I know what overbooked is , I just don ' t understand how that could happen ?
<user0> Actually it ' s a common practice to overbook , as passengers often don ' t take their flight as scheduled . Most of the time there is no problem but today , more passengers arrived than we have seats ,
<user1> So who has to stay behind ?
<user0> Well , first we ask for volunteers . If someone like yourself volunteers , they receive a free round trip ticket to be used within one year . If no one volunteers we just have to select someone .
<user1> Ok . I ' ll volunteer . I could use a free ticket !
<user1> I ' m glad to hear that .
<user0> How much are you asking ?
<user1> You will have to pay $ 1050 every month .
<user0> I can ' t afford that .
<user1> What can you afford ?
<user0> I was thinking $ 800 a month .
<user1> I ' ll need you to pay more than that .
<user0> How much more ?
<user1> How does $ 900 every month sound to you ?
<user0> I can live with that .
<user1> We have a deal then .
<user1> Good morning , Mr . Thomas , it is nice to see you too .
<user0> After the internal discussion , we have all agreed that you are the most suitable person for this position among all the candidates . So , today let ' s talk about your expected salary and social benefits . What is your expected salary ?
<user1> I ' Ve worked in the field for more than 4 years . Depend on my work qualifications and experience , I would like to have 5000 Yuan to start .
<user0> The basic salary for your position in our company would be 4800 Yuan to start with increases giving according to your performance .
<user1> It is a bit lower than I expected . But I can accept that . What are the working hours ?
<user0> 40 hours a week , Monday to Friday , 9 AM to 5 PM with one hour lunch break every day ..
<user1> Do I have to work on weekend ? If so , how do you pay for the overtime ?
<user0> We do expect overtime work when it is necessary , but we pay twice of the work hour for working on weekends and three times for working on national holidays like Spring Festival and the Mid-Autumn Day .
<user1> Is there probation ?
<user0> No probation is involved . If you feel good , you can start next week .
<user1> One Big Mac and French Fries .
<user0> Is there anything else ?
<user1> Give me one coke , please .
<user0> Is this to go or to eat here ?
<user1> To go , please .
<user0> That comes to four dollars and ten cents .
<user1> And can I have some ketchup , please ?
<user0> It's on the service counter over there . Please go to help yourself .
<user1> University Street .
<user0> Do you know of any banks near here ?
<user1> You'll see one at the corner on your right .
<user1> Yeah how ' d you know ?
<user0> You can always spot the newbies . I can give you a few pointers if you want . Were you trying to use this machine here ?
<user1> Yeah ! I just started my training today and I ' m not really sure where to begin .
<user0> It ' s ok , I know how it is . This machine here will work out your upper body , mainly your triceps and biceps . Are you looking to develop strength or muscle tone and definition ?
<user1> Well , I don ' t want to be ripped like you ! I just want a good physique with weights and Carpio .
<user0> In that case you want to work with less weight . You can start off by working ten to fifteen reps in four sets . Five kilo weights should be enough . Now it ' s very important that you stretch before pumping iron or you might pull a muscle .
<user1> Got it ! Wow is that the weight you are lifting ? My goodness that ' s a lot of weight !
<user0> It ' s not that much . Just watch ... I ' m ok ...
<user1> Do you have a hotel card or something ?
<user0> Let's see.Yes , I have the address and telephone number here .
<user1> Oh , you're staying at the downtown Hilton.Then , you go down two blocks this way and turn left.You ' ll find it on the right .
<user0> Well , I don't understand it very well.Will you draw me a map ?
<user1> The railway station ? Just go down this street and turn left at the second corner . The station is at the end of that street .
<user0> How long will it take me to get there ?
<user1> It's about a ten-minute walk .
<user0> That's very clear . I think I can find my way now . Thank you .
<user1> Not at all .
<user1> We have hundreds of constituencies and the voters in each one elect a member of parliament . Most people call them mp ' s .
<user0> Each mp belongs to a political party , right ?
<user1> Almost all of them do . A few are independent . That means that they do not belong to a party . If one party more than half of the mp ' s . they form a government . That means that they choose a prime Finist
<user0> What ' s a cabinet ?
<user1> This is a small group of people-perhaps 25 mp ' s who are usually ministers . They make all the big decision and discuss laws and policy .
<user0> Can any mp make a law ?
<user1> Any mp can present a law to parliament . The proposed law is debated and voted on . If it is accepted , it becomes law .
<user0> I suppose a proposed a law needs the support of the big political parties .
<user1> Yes , it does , because they have most of the mp ' s . most mp ' s vote the way their party wants them to .
<user0> How do people choose which party or candidate to vote for ?
<user1> They produce manifesto . These documents which states their policies . Some people just vote for the same party every time there is an election . Voters who often change the party they vote for are Calle
<user1> Pretty good . The HR manager asked me the usual questions . Then he wondered why I had decided to leave my previous job .
<user0> What did you say ?
<user1> I told him that I hadn ' t got a raise for three years . I also told him that one of my best co-workers quitted her job because she had not been promoted for eight years .
<user0> Did he want to know the reasons ?
<user1> Yes . I told him that my boss made some excuses of the recession . But I thought he had a pattern and a record of promoting men only .
<user0> That ' s sex discrimination . When will you get the reply ?
<user1> In a couple of days , I was told .
<user0> Wish you good luck !
<user1> Thank you .
<user1> Generally speaking , he needs creativity , the ability to communicate , sense of personal responsibilities , the ability to solve problems and so on .
<user0> Do you have all these qualities ?
<user1> Yes , I have all of them . I am totally competent to be a senior executive .
<user1> Could you be a little more specific , sir ?
<user0> Well , to be more specific , the free stuff , like soap , lotion , and shampoo .
<user1> I understand . Now , you're saying that you've already used up all your amenities ?
<user0> Oh , no ! I've got all I need for my stay here .
<user1> So , what's the problem ?
<user0> I need souvenirs !
<user1> You want some souvenirs !
<user0> Yes , yes . Souvenirs .
<user1> But , sir , our souvenir shop carries all those items .
<user0> That's not the same thing . If you buy hotel souvenirs , they have no sentimental value .
<user1> I understand , sir . I'll call housekeeping . You'll have your souvenirs shortly .
<user1> Yes.We ' re interested in seeing the rooms for rent .
<user0> Oh , how nice.They ' re bright rooms and the house is very quiet .
<user1> A nice quiet house is exactly what we're looking for .
<user0> Well , gentleman.Each room is $ 40 a week if you think that's OK .
<user1> That sounds just wonderful to us .
<user0> When do you want to move in ?
<user1> How about this afternoon ?
<user0> Fine . I'll be expecting you around two .
<user1> No , I'll have the fish please .
<user0> The chicken is also nice .
<user1> No , I want the fish .
<user0> Our special tonight is lobster .
<user1> Thank you , but I prefer the fish .
<user0> Perhaps you'd enjoy the lamb .
<user1> No , I like the fish .
<user0> What ever you say ?
<user1> It's almost ready . Can you set the table ?
<user0> All right .
<user1> Want to taste this dish ?
<user0> Yeah . Oh , it's delicious !
<user1> Really ?
<user0> Definitely . It's a wonderful meal . Thank you , Honey .
<user1> If you like to help me do the dishes , I'll be more dreadful .
<user0> I wish I could , but I won't .
<user1> Good morning , Vera , Nice to meet you .
<user0> Kate , I know you ' Ve been a stewardess for more than one year . And I ' ll have an interview on stewardess tomorrow . Can you tell me some etiquette about the interview ?
<user1> Of course . First you should do up your long hair and do make up but not too thick .
<user0> Is there anything else I should pay attention to ?
<user1> Yes , when you attend the interview , you should pay attention to your manner , style of conversation and expression . You should keep smiling always , being polite when you talk with the interviewer . Don't move from time to time when you sit there . And you also should know how to use eye contact .
<user0> Thank you , I've learned so much from you .
<user1> That ' s all right . Hope you can do better tomorrow .
<user1> Well ... uh ... how about a glass of juice instead ?
<user0> No . I'd like tea . Can you put it in my favorite cup ? You probably washed it ...
<user1> Oh , yeah . Well , uh , about your mug ...
<user0> I'll find it ... Where are all the floral pattern plates ? And dad's Yankee's mug ?
<user1> Yes , I'd like to settle my bill .
<user0> Certainly sir . May I have your room key , please ?
<user1> Sure . Here you are .
<user0> Just a moment , please . I'll draw up your bill for you ... Thank you for waiting , sir . Your bill totals two thousand six hundred and fifty-eight yuan , including the phone and laundry .
<user1> That much ! Would you mind letting me have a look at it ?
<user0> Not at all , sir . Here you are .
<user1> Thanks . Well , It seems to be right . How much is that in dollars , please ?
<user0> Just a moment , sir . I'll calculate that for you . It comes to 305 dollars and 52 cents at today's exchange rate .
<user1> I see . OK .
<user0> How would you like to make the payment ?
<user1> In cash , please . Here you are .
<user0> Thank you , sir ... Here is your change . Could you check it , please ? Thank you for choosing our hotel . I hope you enjoyed your stay .
<user1> By the way , please forward my mail to this address .
<user0> Certainly , sir . We hope you have a good trip .
<user1> You really should go to Rachel's pet store .
<user0> why ? anything special there ?
<user1> it's more than special . You can find as many kinds of animals as you can put a name to and more .
<user0> Oh , really ? are there any snakes ?
<user1> snakes ? there are even rodents and monkeys ! it's a world of exotic pets .
<user0> that's terrific . I can't wait to check it out .
<user1> Hang on . are you sure you want to keep a non-traditional pet ?
<user0> why not ? it's so cool .
<user1> but it will pose a risk to your health .
<user0> pardon ?
<user1> i mean , most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria . they are likely to cause immune system problems .
<user0> well , I didn't realize that .
<user1> I don't believe it's a good choice to keep those pets , especially for families with young children .
<user0> oh , I should have thought of my brother's baby girl . Maybe I'll just have a dog instead of an exotic pet .
<user1> yes , good luck , Maria .
<user1> Nice to meet you . My name ' s Sophie .
<user0> Are you French ?
<user1> Yes , I ' m . Are you French , too ?
<user0> No , I ' m not .
<user1> What nationality are you ?
<user0> I ' m Italian . Are you a teacher ?
<user1> No , I ' m not .
<user0> What ' s your job ?
<user1> I ' m a keyboard operator . What ' s your job ?
<user0> I ' m an engineer .
<user1> I am proud to know that he is our President .
<user0> You voted for him , right ?
<user1> Did you vote for him , because I know that I did .
<user0> I did , too .
<user1> I have nothing but faith in Obama .
<user0> Really ?
<user1> I ' m sure he will help better America .
<user0> We do need some change in this country .
<user1> Our country is already changing as it is .
<user0> You ' re absolutely right .
<user1> I trust that he will take good care of our country .
<user1> No , I ' m afraid we don ' t .
<user0> I ' m sorry the restaurant is full now . You have to wait for about half an hour . Would you like to have a drink at the lounge until there ' s a table available .
<user1> No , thanks , I ' ll come back later . May I reserve a table for two ?
<user0> Yes , of course . May I have your name , sir ?
<user1> Bruce By the way , can we have a table by the window ?
<user0> we ' ll try to arrange it , but I can ' t guarantee sir .
<user1> That ' s fine .
<user0> your table's ready , sir ? Please step this way .
<user1> Yes , of course . There are many tea houses and bars in China , too . People can drink , eat and relax at these places .
<user0> You like to go to these places , don ' t you ?
<user1> Yes , sometimes the music there is so beautiful . It is very romantic . I can stay there for hours .
<user0> Do you often go there alone ?
<user1> No , I often go there with my friends .
<user1> I see . You are in luck this month because all of our models are on sale ! it is a perfect time to buy a new car since it ' s the end of the year .
<user0> Perfect ! I like this one .
<user1> That is the Ford Focus . A very light but powerful vehicle . It comes with dual side airbags , power steering and power windows , tinted windows and your choice of either automatic or manual transmission .
<user0> Sounds like a good car ! How many miles to the gallon ?
<user1> It is a very fuel efficient vehicle giving you about 34 miles in the city and 40 on the highway .
<user0> That is really convenient . Especially now that fuel prices are so high ! What ' s under the hood ?
<user1> A very powerful 2.5- liter turbocharged engine , Trust me , this car is fast !
<user0> Now for the most difficult question . What is the price tag for this lovely vehicle ?
<user1> Very affordable mam . You can take it out of this lot today with 0 % down payment and no interest for the first year ! You can test drive it now and we can sign the papers when we get back .
<user0> Great ! Let ' s do it !
<user1> Well , I have got a vacancy .
<user0> What sort of price are you asking ?
<user1> Eight dolls fifty a week excluding laundry .
<user0> Would it be convenient to see the room ?
<user1> Can you call back later ? We're right in the middle of lunch .
<user1> Here you are . Do you need glue ?
<user0> That is very kind of you . I ' m just running out of glue .
<user1> You ' re welcome .
<user1> Hello . I'd like to speak to someone regarding my card .
<user0> Sorry , I'm not quite sure if I understand . In what way , Sir ? Has your card been stolen ?
<user1> No , no . Nothing at all like that . It's just that I applied for a credit card with you a while ago , my application was accepted , but I'm still waiting for my card .
<user0> Oh , I see , Sir . Well , it does take 5 working days to issue and post the card .
<user1> Yes , my application was accepted last Friday . Now it's Wednesday , that's more than 5 days .
<user0> Sorry , Sir , but it's 5 working days . This does not include weekends , so your card should be with you later this week .
<user1> Of course ! How silly of me ! Yes , 5 working days would mean this Friday , at the earliest . I see . I'm sorry to trouble you .
<user0> It's no trouble at all , Sir . Is there anything else I can help you with today ?
<user1> Nothing , thanks . I again apologise for the misunderstanding , bye for now .
<user1> We'd like to order breakfast for tomorrow morning .
<user0> Yes , sir . What would you like ?
<user1> Orange juice , scrambled eggs , bacon , toast and coffee .
<user0> OK , and when shall I bring it here ?
<user1> About seven thirty.By the way , could you also bring me tomorrow's papers ?
<user0> Of course , sir .
<user1> You should do one of the two things - either to lodge a claim with the shipowner or with the insurance company .
<user0> Shall we leave it to the brokers ?
<user1> Yes . They usually do it .
<user0> Do they charge for that ?
<user1> Of course . In Europe , they charge a commission of 1 % of the amount of the claim for their service .
<user0> Is it the same in America ?
<user1> They do the work without charge to the importer .
<user0> It's part of their service , isn't it ?
<user1> Exactly .
<user0> Is it enough to claim with an on board bill of lading ?
<user1> No , you must also obtain a statement from the shipping agent certifying that the goods were actually loaded on their vessel for shipment .
<user0> I see . By the way , how do we prove the ownership of our goods ?
<user1> You must provide full original set of ocean bills of lading original insurance policy or certificate and the original commercia invoice .
<user0> I see . Thank you .
<user1> You are welcome .
<user1> OK , Mum , when will you be back ?
<user0> I'll be back in ten days .
<user1> Just a minute , please . It's in my bag . Here it is .
<user0> Thank you . Please fill out the Baggage Declaration Form .
<user1> All right . Shall I enter all my belongings ?
<user0> No , only the articles listed on the Declaration .
<user1> Yeah me too . Oh ! Can we stop at the shop really fast ? I lost my makeup bag at the airport and I want to pick up a few things .
<user0> Will you take long ?
<user1> No ! Five minutes I promise !
<user0> Come on ! We have been here for almost an hour ! I thought you said you were only going to get a few things ! How long does it take you to pick out a lipstick and some nail polish !
<user1> Are you crazy ? You have no idea what you are talking about ! Just for my eyes I have to get eye-liner , an eyelash curler , eye shadow , an eyebrow pencil and mascara . Then I need to get foundation , liquid foundation .
<user0> Whoa whoa whoa ! Are you nuts ? How much is all this going to cost ? I ' m looking at the price at each one of these little things and it ' s outrageous ! This is basically a crayon !
<user1> What about you ? You spend as much or more money on your razors , after shave , cologne and gel ! Not to mention how much you spend on clothes and ...
<user0> Fine ! Get the stupid thirty dollar crayon !
<user1> No !
<user0> Come on ! I'll pay you back on Tuesday .
<user1> Last time I lent you money , you never paid me back .
<user0> I promise if you lend me five dollars today , I will repay you in full next week .
<user1> Ok , but I'm taking your skateboard as collateral .
<user0> Fine ! I can't believe you don't trust me .
<user1> It's nothing personal , just business .
<user1> Yes , please . I'm looking for a cotton polo shirt .
<user0> Any particular colour ?
<user1> Not really .
<user0> How about this one ?
<user1> I like the design , but don't particularly care for the colour . Do you have that in other colours , too ?
<user0> Well , they come in white , pale yellow , aqua , red and green . Will a white one do ?
<user1> Yes . I prefer white - and may I see a pale yellow one , too ?
<user0> Why , of course . Let's see ... White ... Pale yellow . Here you are , sir .
<user1> Yeah . How are you these days ?
<user1> Thank you .
<user0> How do you keep fit ?
<user1> I do yoga twice a weeks
<user0> Yoga ? It sounds interesting .
<user1> It was hard at the beginning , but now feel it's really relaxing . It makes me flexible .
<user0> Anything else ?
<user1> Yes , I often go swimming .
<user0> Are you interested in swimming ?
<user1> Yes , I like it very much .
<user1> No , I'm not .
<user0> What are you going to do ? Are you going to work late ?
<user1> No , I'm not . I'm going to look for an apartment .
<user0> An apartment ? Why ?
<user1> I'm going to try to find a place near the office .
<user0> Where are you living now ?
<user1> Out in the suburbs . It's a long trip to work every day .
<user0> How are you going to find an apartment ?
<user1> I'm going to buy a newspaper and check the classified ads .
<user0> Apartments in the city are expensive .
<user1> I know , but I'm going to enroll in a night school to take a course in business management .
<user1> no , it's definitely my turn to treat you ... you paid last time !
<user0> oh , that was just a quick bite to eat---that doesn't count !
<user1> ok , ok , how about we just go Dutch ? It's settled . Listen , I'm still pretty new around here , would it be alright if you found the restaurant ?
<user0> ok ... sure .
<user1> What ' s wrong with the fax machine ? Is it urgent ?
<user0> Yes , very urgent . And there is no other fax machine around . And the office of our boss is closed , so I can not use his machine either . And his secretary is out . Do you have any suggestion ?
<user1> Either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as e-mail , you print it out .
<user1> Do I have to get up now ?
<user0> You'd better get up , or you'll be late .
<user1> What're you talking about ? My alarm even hasn't gone off yet .
<user0> Yes , it did . It went off thirty minutes ago . You slept right through it . You're like a dead person while you sleep .
<user1> I must have slept right through it .
<user0> Rise and shine ! Sleepyhead !
<user1> Just let me sleep five more minutes .
<user0> The early bird gets the worm .
<user1> I know , I know . But I don't want any worms .
<user0> Ha ! Ha ! If you don't make an effort now , later on it'll be a lot tougher for you .
<user1> How about the cinema ?
<user0> That's a good idea . We haven't seen a film for ages . What would you like to see ?
<user1> Oh I don't know . Titanic ?
<user0> Titanic ? That old film ? but I've seen it before !
<user1> Yes . I have a spare room .
<user0> How much are you asking ?
<user1> 10.00 dollars a night .
<user0> Could I see the room , please ?
<user1> Sure.Come on in .
<user1> I feel cold , and I'm shivering . I have a terrible headache and a sore throat .
<user0> How long have you been like that ?
<user1> About a day .
<user0> Let me have a look at your throat first . Please open your mouth and say " ah " .
<user1> Ah ...
<user0> And show me your tongue ... Thank you . That'll do . You have slight tonsillitis , and your throat is inflamed . How is your appetite ?
<user1> Not so good .
<user0> Now , let me take your temperature . Please put this thermometer under your armpit and let me feel your pulse ?
<user1> Your pulse is weak .
<user0> Do I have a temperature , doctor ?
<user1> Yes , you have a high fever . I'd like to give you a blood test .
<user1> I had to blow my nose .
<user0> Did you have to blow right next to the phone ?
<user1> Did you hear that ?
<user0> Of course I heard that . I thought a plane had crashed into your house .
<user1> It wasn't that loud .
<user0> I will blow my nose sometime for you , and you'll see .
<user1> Okay . I'll take your word for it .
<user0> I thought you had an elephant in your house .
<user1> You're funny .
<user0> What did you say ? I think I've gone deaf .
<user1> I'm going into the bathroom to blow my nose . I'll be right back .
<user1> Right away , sir .
<user0> Is this amount correct ?
<user1> Yes , sir , it is .
<user0> Thank you , the service was good
<user1> Please come again .
<user1> What you said is true . But the film producers there are more flexible ways to get more audience . For example , to make more movie Ccds , so people will spend money buying them .
<user0> But it is true that cinemas are losing the attraction they used to have in the past .
<user1> Yes . Take myself for example . I seldom go to cinemas , but it doesn't mean I no longer see films ; instead , I see films at home-watching Ccds .
<user1> Yes , well Miss Childs did give mean overview of the position over the phone , but there were some details I ' d like to clarify .
<user0> Well feel free to ask me anything , and I ' ll try to fill in the details .
<user1> Could I first ask about the remuneration package ?
<user0> Yes , of course . That ' s quite an important point , isn ' t it ? As a junior sub editor we offer a starting salary of 150,000 HK dollars per annum . This doesn ' t include a generous housing allowance also .
<user1> I understand . And are there other bonuses included ?
<user0> Well , apart from full health insurance we do offer a company staff bonus scheme linked to readership numbers . But we could go through all the details of that at a later date .
<user1> Well , Mr . Parsons , I am flexible when it comes to salary . The opportunity to work in Hong Kong for you is the most important thing for me .
<user0> Excellent . Well , what other questions do you have Rebecca ?
<user1> How long will the system be down for ?
<user0> We'll be taking everything offline in about two hours ' time . It'll be down for a minimum of twelve hours . If everything goes according to plan , it should be up again by 6 pm on Saturday .
<user1> That's fine . We've allowed forty-eight hours to be on the safe side .
<user1> Yes , please . I'm here for an International Settlement . Our company has to effect payment , and it needs to be done today . Here's the advice slip for the payment .
<user0> Thanks . I'm sorry to say that you need to get this stamped . There is no stamp on this slip and it is essential before I can process it for you .
<user1> I see . So , I need to stamp it . And sign it too ?
<user0> Yes , that's right . Down here , at the bottom right hand corner to show that you agree to pay the printed amount .
<user1> I'll go back to the office and get it sorted and pop back later . Thanks , bye for now .
<user1> If I ordered a desk today , how would it be before I got delivery in Scotland ?
<user0> Well , I think perhaps you'd better speak to our Production Manager , Mr . Yao . You'll meet him when we go over to the factory .
<user1> Please Show your ticket and passport .
<user0> Here you are .
<user1> Which flight do you want to change ?
<user0> The next one to my destination . I have to be there as soon as possible .
<user1> Hello , this is the apartment manager speaking .
<user0> I'm calling about the apartment for rent on Main Street .
<user1> Would you be interested in seeing the apartment ?
<user0> I would love to see it .
<user1> Are you free today at around 6 p . m . ?
<user0> Yes , I will be able to make it then .
<user1> Well , I'll see you at 6 p . m . Do you know how to get there ?
<user0> I used to live in that area .
<user1> I'll give you an application form when I see you .
<user0> That sounds good . Do I need to bring anything ?
<user1> No . Just bring yourself .
<user1> Yes , here you are .
<user0> Thank you . W hat's your occupation , Mr . Smith ?
<user1> I'm the general manager of the Far-East Industry Corporation .
<user0> You are here on business , aren't you ?
<user1> Yes , I have been invited by the East Import
<user0> I see . Do you have anything to declare ?
<user1> Yes , I have some foreign currency to declare .
<user0> Would you please fill out this currency declaration form ? It's a record of the foreign currency you have brought in .
<user1> All right .
<user1> It'll be $ 65 for a monthly pass .
<user0> Is there anything cheaper than that ?
<user1> If you're in school , you can get a student pass .
<user0> Well , I am how much will that cost ?
<user1> The pass is free .
<user0> I don't have to pay for anything ?
<user1> You'll only have to pay for the monthly sticker .
<user0> How much is the monthly sticker ?
<user1> It's $ 24 for each month .
<user0> I'll take the student bus pass .
<user1> Okay , I'll get you one .
<user1> Well , it'll take three weeks to demolish the old building and clear away the debris . We should be ready to start the construction work in week 23 .
<user0> How long will the sub contractors be on site ?
<user1> About ten weeks in total if everything goes according to plan .
<user0> I'm sure it will . So , we should be able to start moving the machinery in during week 34 . I'll confirm that date with our suppliers .
<user1> Andrew , this is Linda Chen .
<user0> Hi Linda , what can I do for you ?
<user1> I need to set up an appointment to get my hair fixed .
<user0> For what day ?
<user1> Tuesday morning .
<user1> I'm not getting one .
<user0> Why is that ?
<user1> It's cheaper if I don't buy one .
<user0> Buying a bus pass will save you money .
<user1> How do you figure that ?
<user0> There's no limit to how often you can use your bus pass .
<user1> Really ?
<user0> Plus , you don't have to use change for the bus anymore .
<user1> I like that .
<user0> You want to buy one now ?
<user1> I'm going to .
<user1> Yes , I would like a roast duck and my friend wants steaks .
<user0> How do you like your steaks ?
<user1> I'd like it medium-well .
<user0> OK , sir , wait a minute .
<user1> Usually it's 60 dollars for a manicure , and 80 dollars for a pedicure . But with this special discount , the total for both is only one hundred and 20 dollars , and you can get them painted .
<user0> That's nice . I'd like to give it a try . I think I like passion red . please .
<user1> Alright.Do you want your cuticles cut , too ?
<user0> No .
<user1> Would you like the shapes square or round ?
<user0> Square . But with round at the edges , please .
<user1> All right , it's done . Please follow me to the drying section .
<user0> How long will it take to get them dry ?
<user1> Ten or about five minutes . You'll be all set .
<user0> I see , thank you .
<user1> Oh , hello , Lucy . What's up ?
<user0> I'm afraid I can't come to work today , Mr . Smith .
<user1> Oh , what's wrong with you ?
<user0> I've got a fever and a very sore throat .
<user1> Well , you sound ill over the phone .
<user0> Yes . I have to stay in bed today , but I'll be able to come tomorrow .
<user1> That's all right . Have a good rest until you feel well enough .
<user0> Thank you , Mr . Smith . Goodbye .
<user1> Goodbye , Lucy .
<user1> I am sorry , sir , the fish you ordered will take a longer time because we make it with fresh fish .
<user0> That's fine . Would you please bring me some wine ?
<user1> Sure , is dry white wine OK ?
<user0> Yes . Thank you .
<user1> Why , what's the problem ?
<user0> I have a dentist appointment .
<user1> Okay .
<user1> Wonderful ! We can meet your requirements and the offer is ready for you . Here it is . The unit price is USD 15.00 per kilogram .

<user1> No , not at all .

<user0> I'll go take a look . Thanks for your help .
<user1> You're welcome .
<user1> Good morning . You are speaking to the property manager .
<user0> While it was raining last night , water started leaking in from the ceiling .
<user1> Was it leaking in the bedroom ?
<user0> It was in the living room .
<user1> Can you tell me which floor you are on ?
<user0> We are on the bottom floor .
<user1> I would like to look at the leak . Will you be home this morning ?
<user0> Yes , someone will be here to let you in .
<user1> Just in case you have to leave , we will just use the master key .
<user1> I have earned 10,000 a year including bonuses .
<user0> How much do you want us to pay you ?
<user1> I like to be paid more than that . Hopefully , 150,000 a year . To be honest , I left the company to get more income .
<user1> Of course , that's my job . Oh , dear . What's happened ?
<user0> Well , it's eaten my card ! It won't give it back !
<user1> I see ... calm down , don't worry . May I ask what were you doing when it took your card ?
<user0> Yes . I was only entering my PIN . I'm terrible at remembering it , I'm so forgetful , you see .
<user1> Mmmm ... and exactly how many times did you enter it , please ?
<user0> Maybe three times . As I said , I always forget it .
<user1> Ah ! Don't worry ; it's just a security measure . If someone uses a card and cannot get the right PIN after three attempts , the bank keeps the card in case it's stolen . Just contact the bank and we'll get it back to you .
<user0> Oh , I see . So if I call my branch they can sort everything out for me ?
<user1> Yes , they'll be happy to help . Believe me , it happens to many people .
<user0> I'd better try harder to memorise my PIN in future . Thanks .
<user1> Yes , it is .
<user0> I want to pick up my parcels .
<user1> Please show me your parcel order .
<user0> OK . Here you are .
<user1> Let me check your parcel number . Song Ping's parcel number should be CP 06230221 5 CN . Here is your parcel .
<user0> Thank you .
<user1> Not at all .
<user1> I'm trying to decide what to wear to school the first day .
<user0> Oh , A . Mom didn't tell you ?
<user1> Didn't tell me what ? What ?
<user0> This Bs ' school you're going to is going to make your life easy .
<user1> What are you talking about brother ? Spill it .
<user0> Uniforms , sis , no more worrying about appearances !
<user1> You mean I have to wear the same thing every day ? MOM !
<user1> Steak , please .
<user0> How would you like it ?
<user1> Medium rare , please .
<user0> Anything else , sir ?
<user1> May I have a glass of red wine , please ?
<user0> Of course .
<user1> Yes , we do . We like it very much .
<user0> I've come to make sure that your stay in Beijing is a pleasant one .
<user1> Thank you so much .
<user1> Yes , I'm glad we've had very pleasant cooperation in the previous years . And your achievement for promoting our clothes was great in the three years .
<user0> So , I wish to apply for the sole agency of your product in our local market . If you give us the agency , that will be more substantial for our cooperation .
<user1> To be frank , you are not the only one who applies for an agent for us in your country . I'd like to know some ideas of terms on which you would be willing to operate as our agent .
<user0> As we are a well-established company , we are very familiar with the customers ' needs . Besides , we can make full use of our good connections with the wholesalers and retailers here and develop a good market for your products if appointed as your agent .
<user1> Sounds reasonable . I will tell my boss about you agent application . Another question , what do you think is the minimum annual sales you can guarantee ?
<user0> To be on the safe side , and for garment of all materials , sizes , and styles , I think the amount will be 50,000 pieces a year .
<user1> Well . As our sole agency , you will neither handle the same or similar products of other origins nor re-export our goods to any other area outside your own .
<user0> No , certainly not .
<user1> Yes ?
<user0> I bought this circulator here yesterday but it doesn't work .
<user1> Oh , let's see what's wrong .
<user1> Aisle A is where you'll find all the produce .
<user0> What sales do they have today ?
<user1> I'm sure something is on sale . Please check with the produce person .
<user1> Speaking .
<user0> Excuse my troubling you . You purchased our products last year and now I am following up to find out about their workings . Are they still in good condition now ?
<user1> Yeah , exactly ! I bought them last year . En ... at present , they are still in good state .
<user0> That's it ! All of them have first-class quality and performance . Besides , we adopt advanced technology . Now we have developed new products . They are much better than what you have bought .
<user1> Your company is developing so fast . Maybe later on I will plan to buy more .
<user0> That's great ! Thanks for your support . If any , please remember to call us . I am afraid I have to say goodbye now ! Bye , Mr . James !
<user1> Bye !
<user1> Yes , sir ...

<user1> Let's see ... my ID card , my passport , and my suitcase . I'm pretty sure I've got everything .
<user1> Yes , what can I do for you ?
<user0> I just want to call and say thank you for letting me interview yesterday .
<user1> You are welcome , Mr . Sun .
<user0> And I also want to know what the status is of the position .
<user1> Sorry , we haven't made the decision at all . But we should be making the decision by the end of this week . And we'll get in touch with you once we make it .
<user0> Do you have any questions we didn't cover in the interview ?
<user1> No .
<user0> Thank you , I am looking forward to hearing from you . Bye-bye .
<user1> Thank you for the calling . Bye-bye .
<user1> Any other discomfort ?
<user0> Yes . Sometimes I can notice a constriction in the chest and shortness of breath after a fit of sneezing . And I often suffer from a running nose with a profuse watery discharge .
<user1> Does it occur seasonally or all year round ?
<user0> It has been seasonal during these past three years .
<user1> Are you sensitive to other things ?
<user0> Yes , things like seafood and penicillin-type drugs .
<user1> OK . Let me examine your nose . According to your case history and the examination , I believe that it's allergic rhinitis .
<user0> What useful treatment can you offer ?
<user1> I'll give you a series of specific skin tests . Then we'll know exactly what substances you're allergic to . Then I'll give you some causes of desensitization therapy .
<user1> Sure , why not ?
<user0> This is a new product of company this year . It's oil-free .
<user1> I see . It feels very light on the skin .
<user0> It gives your skin a very natural healthy look .
<user1> I like the cool smell , too .
<user1> First you make a list of what you wanna buy ...
<user0> But I ' Ve gotta have the budge before anything else .
<user1> Well , that ' s a problem , isn ' t it ?
<user1> No , I was way too busy studying all the time . How about you ?
<user0> Yeah , I worked about twenty hours a week in a pizza restaurant .
<user1> What was that like ?
<user0> It was always very busy there .
<user1> What did you do ?
<user0> I stood behind the register and took pizza orders .
<user1> Did you get any perks on the job ?
<user0> Yeah , I got to eat as much pizza as I could for free .
<user1> Yes . What's the buying rate for euro ?
<user0> 1.15 U . S . dollars to the euro .
<user1> Okay . I'd like to change some euro into US dollars , please .
<user0> Sure . How much would you like to change ?
<user1> Six hundred euro .
<user0> Very good . May I see your passport ?
<user1> Here you are .
<user0> How would you like your bills ?
<user1> In fifties please .
<user1> I'm looking for a bookcase , but I don't want to buy a new one .
<user0> Are you having any luck ?
<user1> Not really . There aren't any used bookcases listed . But there are a few rummage sales on Saturday . I think I'll go to them .
<user0> Do you mind if I go with you ?
<user1> Not at all . These private sales are great places to bargain . And sometimes you can find terrific things among all the junk .
<user0> I learned to negotiate from my mother . I thought I was pretty good at bargaining , but I had a problem the other day at Kimble's Department Store .
<user1> What happened ?
<user0> I wanted to buy a beautiful wool sweater for my girlfriend . It was priced at forty dollars , so I started by offering the salesclerk thirty .
<user1> Not really . I like looking on the internet at what ' s available , but I usually prefer to actually see and touch what I ' m buying before I pay for it . Sometimes , I ' ll look at something in a shop , but lat
<user0> No . I ' m a little worried about security . You never know who ' s trying to find out your codes and passwords . Aren ' t you worry about that ?
<user1> Not really . I know that it happens , but if you buy from reputable companies with secure websites , you should be ok . Even though I use online shopping facilities , I don ' t think it ' s the best way to sho
<user0> I ' m surprised to hear you say that . I thought you loved anything technological .
<user1> I do . I ' m a big fan of using new technology , but I don ' t want to sit in front of a computer screen all day . I think people need to get out and interact with other people .
<user0> So , how about coming to the department store with me ? I want to see if there are any new summer clothes on sale yet .
<user1> Sure . I ' d love to join you . Can we stop by the computer store ? I just want to see if they have something .
<user0> Sure . While you ' re in the computer store . I will visit the book store opposite . I like to browse through their books and see if they have anything interesting .
<user1> Ok . I ' Ve finished online . Let ' s go . I ' ll just get some money and my credit card .
<user0> Thanks for reminding me . I had forgotten to get mine .
<user1> It suits my taste . You are really a good cook .
<user0> Would you like to try my special recipe ?
<user1> Wow , let me try . It tastes nice . How did you make it ?
<user0> It ' s as easy as pie . I always follow recipes .
<user1> Yes . In fact , the recommendation letter written by the university is an indirect self-recommendation . In the long period of cooperation , the university has established good relationship with the companies or organizations , they trust each other well . If your university recommends you , you can be approved more easily .
<user0> But I find that most of the recommendation letters written by universities are the same . So I doubt its authority .
<user1> More and more persons have the same discoveries since most universities do that in order to save energy . If your university also does like this , you can look for other methods , because such kinds of recommendations say nothing for you .
<user0> Could you tell me whether or not I send out my resume with it ?
<user1> It depends . If it has something special or useful , I suggest you send it out .
<user1> Just fill out an application .
<user0> Do I have to send an E-mail ?
<user1> You are expected to know the E-mail address of the unit .
<user0> But I still don't know which unit is in need of staff .
<user1> Send out an application through Job-wanted on the website .
<user0> Can any unit see my information ?
<user1> It's a two-way choice . And your application will be read .
<user0> Which websites offer this service ?
<user1> Sina , 21st Century Talent Net , and a few others .
<user0> Thank you .
<user1> I dare you to say that again .
<user1> Yes . I was Propaganda department minister of our university .
<user0> Did you get any honors or awards at your university ?
<user1> No . It ' s a pity about it .
<user0> Were you involved in any club activities at your university ?
<user1> Yes . I was a member of the basketball Society . I like playing basketball .
<user0> What extracurricular activities did you usually take part in at your college ?
<user1> I sometimes played basketball and sometimes played football .
<user1> Yes . That is why I'm here .
<user0> Tell me your argument .
<user1> I was pulled over for allegedly speeding .
<user0> Are you sure you weren't speeding ?
<user1> To be honest , I really wasn't .
<user0> What speed were you going ?
<user1> I was under the speed limit . I was going 35 , when the speed limit was 40 .
<user0> I'm just going to let you go , since the arresting officer isn't here .
<user1> What about my ticket ? Do I still need to pay ?
<user0> Don't worry about it .
<user1> I'm so glad for your help .
<user1> Yes , I like it , because it's convenient .
<user0> Last week , I tried to buy a new cellphone online , but I didn't know how to pay for it .
<user1> First , you should open an account at the online bank . After that , you can buy anything you want online .
<user0> Are there many things online ?
<user1> Sure . You can find everything all over the world . Let's check it out online ! ( They log in a shopping website . )
<user0> That's amazing . Oh , an on line virtual supermarket ?
<user1> Let's click to check it out .
<user0> Oh , I got it . It simulates the real supermarket , which makes it feel so real . Mom will love it . She loves shopping in supermarkets .
<user1> So what is it ?
<user0> You gotta help me out this time , buddy .
<user1> Another tough thing , I guess .
<user1> I don't know what happened !
<user0> You cancelled the song , didn't you , Jack ?
<user1> No , I didn't . Really !
<user0> Then , is the machine broken or ...
<user1> Yes . The reservation under Mr . Watson .
<user0> Ah , yes , a table for four at 8
<user1> Em , no , thanks . I think we'll go straight to the table , By the way . may I check my overcoat here ?
<user0> Certainly , sir . We'll keep it in the cloakroom for you . Here is your number . When you leave , show it to the waiter behind the counter , please .
<user1> Thank you . Could you show us to our table now ?
<user0> Would you please follow me , please ?
<user1> Thank you .
<user0> This is your table . It's Number 10 .
<user1> I ' m looking for a sweater .
<user0> What size are you looking for ?
<user1> Well , I ' m looking for size 10 but you don ' t have it .
<user0> How about this one ? I think it looks terrific on you .
<user1> Yes , I like the color . Can I try it on ?
<user0> Sure . The fitting room is on your right .
<user1> It fits well . I like it a lot . What do you think ?
<user0> You look pretty in red .
<user1> Oh , it ' s my favorite . How much is it ?
<user0> $ 29.99 .
<user1> Okay . I ' ll take it . Thank you very much for your help .
<user0> You ' re welcome .
<user1> We have only one mid-size car left .
<user0> Great , what's the rate per day ?
<user1> It's 40 $ plus tax per day on limited mileage .
<user0> I'm going to need it for three days .
<user1> Can I see your driver's license ?
<user0> Sure , here is my driver's license .
<user1> Please sign here .
<user1> I think that we have a pretty good idea of what we would like to order .
<user0> Let me tell you about the specials of the day , which are chicken in a wine sauce with capers , and grilled garlic shrimp .
<user1> I was wondering if the chef could leave off the sauce .
<user0> The chef would be happy to accommodate your special requests .
<user1> I am a vegetarian . Do you have any vegetarian selections ?
<user0> You could choose the roasted vegetable and garlic pizza or the goat cheese and candied walnut salad .
<user1> I think that we will split the roasted vegetable and garlic pizza .
<user0> That is a good selection , and I can bring your salads now or serve them with your entree .
<user1> You can bring us our salads when you bring us our entree .
<user1> Are you sure you're using the right program ?
<user0> Well , yes it's definitely the same program but I might have the wrong version . Their system is newer than ours .
<user1> That's why you can't open it . You'll have to upgrade before you can read the file .
<user1> Generally speaking , l am an open-minded person .
<user0> What is your strongest trait ?
<user1> Cheerfulness and friendliness .
<user0> How would your friends or colleagues describe you ?
<user1> They say Mr . Sun is a friendly , sensitive , caring and determined person .
<user0> What personality do you admire ?
<user1> I admire a person who is honest , flexible and easy-going .
<user0> How do you get along with others ?
<user1> I get on well with others .
<user1> What seems to be the problem ?
<user0> I have a rash that I need a doctor to look at .
<user1> Do you have a fever with that rash ?
<user0> No , it just itches a lot .
<user1> I have openings on Tuesday or Wednesday . Which would be best for you ?
<user0> I need an appointment on Tuesday .
<user1> Fine , I am putting you down for 9
<user0> I would like to see Dr . Jones .
<user1> I can schedule you with him with no problem . We look forward to seeing you .
<user1> It ' s probably just people trying to get an early start out of the city for the weekend . Nobody sticks around in the summer .
<user0> Really ? Then , I guess I won ' t have a hard time finding a room or getting a cab ?
<user1> Actually , you might because there ' s a big convention in town this weekend .
<user0> I ' m not too worried about it . I always seem to find something .
<user1> I'd like to withdraw some money from my account .
<user0> Please fill out this slip stating how much you wish to withdraw .
<user1> Well , actually , it's quite a substantial amount . Here's my Bank Book . Will that cause a problem ?
<user0> On your account there is no limit to over the counter withdrawals , it won't cause a problem . Here's your money , 10,000 RIB . Please count it before you leave .
<user1> Yes , that seems to be all in order . Thanks very much .
<user1> Do you have many different suppliers ?
<user0> Yes . There are about fifty names on our approved supplier list , but for raw materials we tend to deal with three local companies .
<user1> You'll never be in shape until you eat less and take more exercise .
<user0> Now , tell me what you often eat .
<user1> I often eat fish and eggs .
<user0> Do you eat a lot of vegetables ?
<user1> Oh yes , and fruits . I love fruits very much .
<user0> What do you like to drink ?
<user1> Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea .
<user0> Whatever would you like to drink ?
<user1> I drink a lot of milk . I drink milk almost every day .
<user0> How often do you exercise ?
<user1> Well , I walk every day .
<user0> It's a good diet and a regular exercise .
<user1> Yes , quite right .
<user1> Why do you need to leave early ?
<user0> I don ' t feel so good .
<user1> What doesn ' t feel right ?
<user0> I feel as if I am going to be sick to my stomach .
<user1> Perhaps you should get checked out at the Student Health Center before you go home .
<user0> I have some medicine at home that I could take .
<user1> Are you going to be OK to drive home , or would you like someone to go with you ?
<user0> Thank you , but my friend is in the library , and he can give me a ride home .
<user1> We hope that you are feeling better soon . E-mail me if you have any questions .
<user1> It ' s still up in the air . There is something wrong between us .
<user1> Our price will be not less than $ 5000 .
<user0> Your price is higher than I expected . Could you give us a little discount ?
<user1> This is already our best price .
<user0> But the price is always negotiable and you should consider our quantity of order .
<user1> Well , what would you suggest ?
<user0> Could you make it $ 4500 ?
<user1> I'm afraid that there is no room to negotiate the price . This is the best price we can quote .
<user0> Can we meet each other half way ?
<user1> What do you mean ?
<user0> Let's close the deal at $ 4800 , OK ?
<user1> You drive a hard bargain ! OK , that's a deal .
<user1> Yes , Ma'am . May I have your name and room number ?
<user0> My name is Terry . I stayed last night in your hotel in room 132 .
<user1> What kind of watch is it ?
<user0> It's a brand-new Seiko wrist watch .
<user1> Yes , we have it .
<user0> Oh , I'm glad to hear that . Would you kindly send it to the Hilton Hotel ?
<user1> I think that it ' s absolutely gorgeous .
<user0> There aren ' t any problems with the apartment ?
<user1> I think that the apartment looks very nice , but I do see some problems .
<user0> What problems ?
<user1> I did notice a few stains in the carpet .
<user0> We will have the carpet cleaned before you move in .
<user1> You will ?
<user0> Yes , but other than that , are there any more problems ?
<user1> That was the only thing that I saw that was wrong with the apartment .
<user0> I ' m happy that you find this apartment so appealing .
<user1> It is . I love it .
<user1> Absolutely . Here it is .
<user0> Could I try it on ?
<user1> Please do , the fitting-room is over there .
<user0> It feels a little tight around the waist . Do you have a bigger one ?
<user1> I'm sorry . We don't have this color in your size . We have some green ones in your size . Would you please have a look at this green one ?
<user0> OK . How much does it cost ?
<user1> It's 486 yuan .
<user1> As I said before , your price is so high that we find it difficult to make a bid . We hope you will take the initiative and bridge the gap .
<user0> Just to comply , we're ready to reduce the price by 5 percent . I hope this concession of ours will get the ball rolling .
<user1> So do we . Certainly it's a step forward on your side . But the gap is still too wide .
<user0> The ball is in your court , Mrs.Wang . What price would you suggest ?
<user1> To make your offer workable , I think you should take another step down as big as the one you've just taken .
<user0> That won't do . You see , our profit margin is very narrow . It simply can't stand such a big cut .
<user1> I hate to disappoint you , Mr . Brown , but if that's the case , we have no alternative but to cover our requirements elsewhere . Do think it over , please . We sincerely hope our discussion will come to a successful conclusion .
<user0> Well , I'm not authorized to agree to such a big reduction . Would you mind waiting a day or two , until I get a reply from the home office ?
<user1> Not at all . Shall we meet again , say , on Friday morning ?
<user0> Good . Friday morning at 9 .
<user1> Good morning.This is Mary.Can I speak to Anne please ?
<user0> I ' m sorry She isn ' t in at the momment.She will come back at half past nineCan I take a message for her ?
<user1> Thank you.But I will call her later
<user0> OK.Goodbye .
<user1> Goodbye .
<user1> I ' m all right , thanks . Just a little tired .
<user0> Late night ?
<user1> Yeah , I got home around two .
<user1> I'm afraid we'll be late for the party .
<user0> Have you got the time , Tom ?
<user1> Yes , my watch says a quarter to seven . but there is something wrong with my watch !
<user0> But you bought it only last month .
<user1> Yes , but ever since I bought it , it gains about five minutes a day , so I ' Ve got to have it repaired .
<user0> How long will it take us to get there ?
<user1> I think about ten minutes by bus .
<user0> It's not far away , then . Let's walk , it's beginning to rain .
<user1> Wait ! I think I see a bus coming now . Let's hope it's the No . 22 bus .
<user1> I found it would be a good idea to get a check-up .
<user0> Yes , well , you haven't had one for 5 years . You should have one every year .
<user1> I know . I figure as long as there is nothing wrong , why go see the doctor ?
<user0> Well , the best way to avoid serious illnesses is to find out about them early . So try to come at least once a year for your own good .
<user1> Ok .
<user0> Let me see here . Your eyes and ears look fine . Take a deep breath , please . Do you smoke , Mr . Smith ?
<user1> Yes .
<user0> Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer and heart disease , you know . You really should quit .
<user1> I've tried hundreds of times , but I just can't seem to kick the habit .
<user0> Well , we have classes and some medications that might help . I'll give you more information before you leave .
<user1> Ok , thanks doctor .
<user1> I'm afraid you've got the wrong extension .
<user0> I'm sorry , but could you please transfer this call to Mr . Tylor's office ?
<user1> Sure , please hold on .
<user0> Thank you .
<user1> Now Mr . Tylor's on the line . Go ahead , please .
<user0> You are so kind , you helped me a lot .
<user1> You are welcome . Bye !
<user1> Hello , this is Quinn from IBA .
<user0> Ah , hello Quinn . Oh dear , you are calling to tell me there is a problem , aren't you ?
<user1> I'm afraid so , yes .
<user0> Hmm ... well , it was my first attempt ! Is it a very big mistake , or can we just alter it ?
<user1> Unfortunately it's rather a big mistake .
<user0> What do you recommend we do ?
<user1> I would recommend we scrap this one and you bring in another set as soon as possible .
<user0> I trust your judgement . Thank you , Quinn . I'll be back tomorrow with a new set . Bye for now .
<user1> You should go to the dentist .
<user0> I hate dentists .
<user1> Well , suffer then . If you have a toothache , you have to go to the dentist .
<user0> It always hurts . I hate going .
<user1> Stop being such a baby . If it really hurts that much , just let them knock you out .
<user0> O . K . , O . K . , I ' ll go .
<user1> Good . You'll feel better after you do .
<user1> Certainly sir , this is our train schedule . We have an express train departing every morning and an overnight train that departs at nine pm .
<user0> How long does it take to get there ?
<user1> About twelve hours . We currently have tickets available only for first class on the express train . If you ' d like , you can choose a sleeper on the overnight train which is a bit less expensive .
<user0> Yeah , I think that is the best option . Do you serve food on the train ? Twelve hours is such a long time !
<user1> Yes , of course . There is a dining car towards the front of the train where they serve meals at all times . We do provide complimentary water and coffee for all of our passengers .
<user0> Great ! I ' ll take it .
<user1> Here you are sir . Your train leaves from platform number nine at nine on the dot . Remember to be here at least thirty minutes before your scheduled departure time or else you might miss your train !
<user0> I understand . Thank you very much !
<user1> Have a great trip .
<user1> A trip to the beach would be fun . How is the weather going to be ?
<user0> The forecast says that it will be warm on the weekend .
<user1> So do you think it'll be perfect weather for the beach ?
<user0> It sounds like it will be .
<user1> I really hope it doesn't get cold .
<user0> That would ruin things , I want to go so badly .
<user1> The weather in California is unpredictable , so you never know .
<user0> That is true . The weather is constantly changing .
<user1> It would be nice if the weather would never change .
<user0> That would be great , then we could plan things sooner .
<user1> True . Predictable weather would make life easier .
<user1> If we think positively , office love can be beneficial to company .
<user0> Beneficial ? I don ' t think so . If two employees get married , they will leave at the same time for a honeymoon , or later one of them will stay at home taking care of babies . If they break up , the company will probably have to relocate one of them to make the workplace more comfortable . By any means , the company must spare extra efforts to solve problems brought by an office dating .
<user1> But if two employees are in love , they will be happy . Happy people are more productive . If they develop an intimate relation with each other , they are willing to share knowledge and experience . It can help to improve work efficiency .
<user0> I doubt that .
<user1> Compared with healthy food , unhealthy food just tastes so much better . And anyway , I believe if you live a low stress Life and are active , you can get away with eating whatever you like . It's all in the mind .
<user0> You have the point . I think cancer is caused by more worry than by the things we consume . Some good things you should try are cranberry juice , wild rice and yoghurt .
<user1> What's special about these things ?
<user0> Cranberry juice is very good for destroying harmful bacteria in your guts because it's very acidic . Wild rice is high in fibre so it's good for your guts and it's high in protein and minerals-I think it's also tastier than normal rice . Yoghurt's good because it's also rich in protein , vitamins and is also acidic . People have been making yoghurt for thousands of years and if you have it every day , your guts will be much more settled .
<user1> Thanks . I'm going to follow your advice and pop down to the supermarket right now .
<user1> You need to take a break , maybe a vacation .
<user0> Oh , yes , indeed . I've run out of steam . To be honest , I want to be in a different environment .
<user1> Is that so ?
<user0> Yes , I don't want to be stuck in a rut . I want to move on .
<user1> Have you decided ?
<user0> Yes . I want to get a better job .
<user1> Could you tell me why you want to quit ?
<user0> I quit just because of the dissatisfying salary and the trouble in getting along with my colleagues .
<user1> Oh , that's terrible . Do you want to get a higher salary in our company ?
<user0> I'm afraid not . I've promised my girlfriend . We'll travel southwards to find a job that offers higher pay .
<user1> OK , I'd like to say that I've really enjoyed working with you . However , I think you should work harder for your new job and then you can ask for higher pay .
<user0> Thank you so much for your advice .
<user1> And every best wish for your new job .
<user0> Thank you .
<user1> Let me see . Oh , No . 11 .
<user0> Here we are , Car 11 . Let's get in .
<user1> Seats No . 20 and 21 . It ' s nice that we ' Ve got a window seat .
<user0> Let's put our suitcases on the rack .
<user1> Oh , the baggage rack is full . Put them under the seat for the time being .
<user0> All right .
<user1> Let's take the bus .
<user0> I hate the bus system in London ! The bus drivers are rude , the buses are never on time , and there are few people around who can help you .
<user1> It's not that bad . You probably just had a bad experience once .
<user0> It wasn't just once . Every single time I take the bus , something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus .
<user1> We could take the subway , but we'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice .
<user0> Train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare , too .
<user1> If we don't hurry up , we'll miss the show . Should we take the bus ?
<user0> We're already late , so I think we had better take a taxi .
<user1> I don't think we'll be able to find a taxi very easily during hush hours . Let's just take the bus .
<user0> Fine . Have a look at the timetable to find out when the next one arrives .
<user1> It looks like it should be here in just a few minutes . don't worry . Nothing bad will happen . I'll even buy your ticket for you .
<user0> Thanks , that was nice of you .
<user1> See , now something good has happened to you on a bus trip !
<user1> From Vancouver , we bike along the border all the way to Winnipeg .
<user0> And that is mostly flat , right ?
<user1> Relatively , once we're out of Alberta , anyway . Then it's hills again in Aitoba .
<user0> And from Winnipeg we go around the lakes through Toronto , right ?
<user1> That's right . And up in to Quebec . And that's where we stop .
<user0> It doesn't sound like that much when we go over the plan but that's a long , long ride .
<user1> Are you ready for the cross country of a lifetime ?
<user1> I'm Bill . I'm in Room 908 . Can you change the room for me ? It's too noisy . My wife was woken up several times by the noise the baggage elevator made . She said it was too much for her .
<user0> I'm awfully sorry , sir . I do apologize . Room 908 is at the end of the corridor . It's possible that the noise is heard early in the morning when all is quiet .
<user1> Anyhow , I'd like to change our room .
<user0> No problem , sir . We'll manage it , but we don't have any spare room today . Could you wait till tomorrow ? The American People-to-people Education Delegation will be leaving tomorrow morning . There'll be some rooms for you to choose from .
<user1> All right . I hope we'll be able to enjoy our stay in a quiet suite tomorrow evening and have a sound sleep .
<user0> Be sure . I'll make a note of that . Everything will be taken care of . And if there is anything more you need , please let us know .
<user1> I'm not ready to go to sleep . I'm not tired .
<user0> It's quite late , and you have an early day tomorrow .
<user1> I'm not going to be able to fall asleep .
<user0> Why don't you try counting sheep ?
<user1> I've tried that before . It really doesn't work .
<user0> That's beside the point , you still need to go to bed .
<user1> Why can't I just stay up until I fall asleep ?
<user0> If I let you do that , then you're just going to be up all night .
<user1> I promise I'll go to sleep soon .
<user0> No , you're going to sleep now , so good night .
<user1> See you in the morning .
<user1> How about your psychological resilience ?
<user0> I think I can work well under pressure , if necessary .
<user1> How would you deal with those who are not easy to get along with ?
<user0> I will just be sincere and friendly to others , and I believe they will treat me the same way .
<user1> You seem to be a kind-hearted lady .
<user0> Thank you . I simply believe the goodness of human nature .
<user1> Please tell me your weaknesses if you can .
<user0> I should admit that sometimes I care too much about the details . I am always in pursuit of perfection .
<user1> Certainly . Mr . Graham . When would you like to meet ?
<user0> I was thinking about this afternoon , after the sales meeting .
<user1> Fine . At 3:30 ?
<user1> Yes , at your company , I think . I'm Frank .
<user0> Oh , I remember now.Very nice to meet you again .
<user1> Nice meeting you , too .
<user1> Shame on you !
<user1> Of course . Here is our thickening mascara . We also have mascara designed to lengthen the eyelashes .
<user0> Alright . And I want to consider your eye shadow too . Do you have a color chart can look at ?
<user1> We have a very wide selection of colors . And our eye shadow is specially designed to moisturize the skin . So it is very gentle on your eyelids . Would you like to sample some ?
<user0> Oh , sure I will need to clean off my own eye shadow first .
<user1> I can help you with that .
<user0> Thank you .
<user1> Yes , we are on the same plane .
<user0> But I am a transfer passenger . I have a connecting flight to Miami .
<user1> So you have to bring your baggage to the transfer check-in area .
<user0> Yes.It ' s quite troublesome .
<user1> Why not go and find a porter ?
<user1> But Mom ! Today we ' re playing football ! I love football !
<user0> You ' Ve got a fever and playing football isn ' t a good idea for a boy with a fever . What ' s that on your arm ?
<user1> I don ' t know . It was there when I woke up this morning .
<user0> It ' s rash . I ' d better take you to see the doctor . How did you get that bruise on your leg ?
<user1> I bashed it against the chair in my room .
<user0> Does it hurt ?
<user1> A little , but not much .
<user0> Here . Put this wet towel on your face to keep your temperature down . I ' ll take you to the doctor ' s after breakfast .
<user1> If I ' m better this afternoon , can I go to school ?
<user0> If you are better , but I doubt you will be .
<user1> You're going out of your way for us , I believe .
<user0> You are our honored guests .
<user1> Yes . We need a plumber here .
<user0> I am looking for a job that is more advanced than that , such as sales manager or regional manager .
<user1> I am sorry . They are not available now .
<user1> Thank you , Mary . We have been looking forward to trying out this restaurant .
<user0> Before your main course , would you like to order an appetizer ?
<user1> Sure , that sounds great . Where are your appetizers listed ?
<user0> There is a special appetizer menu right here in the center of the table .
<user1> The chicken and cheese quesadilla looks good . Is that pretty good ?
<user0> You know , that is one of my favorites !
<user1> OK , I'll take one order of that .
<user0> You could choose another appetizer for half price to share .
<user1> Perfect ! Please add on an order of onion rings .
<user1> What's wrong with the fax machine ? Is it urgent ?
<user0> Yes , very urgent . And there is no other fax machine around . And the office of our boss is closed , so I can not use his machine either . And his secretary is out . Do you have any suggestion ?
<user1> Either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as e-mail , you print it out .
<user1> What would you like to speak to me about ?
<user0> I would like to talk to you about this year ' s election .
<user1> Is that right ?
<user0> I am a volunteer for this year ' s campaign .
<user1> That ' s wonderful . I am impressed at someone so young taking a stand .
<user0> I know history is about to be made , and I would like to be a part of it .
<user1> That ' s fantastic .
<user0> Are you planning on voting ?
<user1> I ' m going to vote .
<user0> Go to your polling place early on Election Day .
<user1> I will . Good luck with your volunteering .
<user1> Yes . I promise it will not happen again .
<user0> We look forward to your settlement at an early date .
<user1> We will inform you as soon as possible .
<user1> Actually , I learn many things from it . I find that I am a quick learner in new things .
<user0> Practice makes perfect . By the way , what do you learn from your job ?
<user1> At first I didn't know anything about the machine . Now I know how to operate it . Besides , the work gives me a sense of fulfillment and achievement .
<user0> Yeah , you are a good learner . I must commend you for your good performance .
<user1> Thank you . That's a long way to go for my job .
<user0> I appreciate your effort very much . The coffee break is over ; it's about time we set to work .
<user1> OK , let's go .
<user1> Judging by all the traffic , I'd say we're near the outskirts of the city .
<user0> What did I do wrong ? Did I take a wrong turn ?
<user1> I'm not sure , but I think you turned right when you should have turned left on the flyover bridge .
<user0> Well , now we should turn back a few kilometres .
<user1> It seems that the traffic sign is much more important than the map .
<user1> Yes . This is Bob Robinson . I ' m calling from room number 627 .
<user0> Hi , Bob . What can I do for you ?
<user1> Is it possible to change to another room ?
<user0> Could you please tell me why ?
<user1> My room is facing the swimming pool . It ' s noisy for me . I have a problem sleeping . And I feel uncomfortable when I take an elevator .
<user0> So you need a quiet side room on the lower floor .
<user1> You ' re right .
<user0> Okay . Let me check for a room on the first floor .
<user1> Thank you .
<user0> I ' Ve only two rooms on the first floor . How about room 108 ?
<user1> That ' s fine . Can I move now ?
<user0> Sure . I ' ll send the bellman to help you .
<user1> Oh , thank you kindly .
<user0> You ' re welcome .
<user1> Let's see . You are importing fifty containers of textiles from China . They should be able to place your order before the end of next week . It will take 2 days for shipping to the port city of Ningpo . The freight will take 3 weeks on the open ocean and will arrive in Los Angeles approximately a month from today . Domestic shipping will be your responsibility , you can make arrangements with the pier in Los Angeles .
<user0> Fine , we will handle domestic shipping , but what about customs ? Will we have to pay tariff on our imports ? I hope we don't run into any problems with the border control .
<user1> No , the Chinese company has that all worked out . With the paperwork you receive with the shipment , you should be good to go .
<user1> Do you have any other particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ?
<user0> No , nothing in particular .
<user1> You may ask questions about us , if you have any .
<user0> All right . When can I start ?
<user1> I would like to fight my ticket .
<user0> Is the arresting officer in the courtroom today ?
<user1> Yes , the officer is here today .
<user0> What's your case ?
<user1> I was pulled over for running a red light , but I never did .
<user0> Do you believe that the officer lied ?
<user1> There was a camera on the signal . So , he was obviously lying .
<user0> Your license plate was caught on camera ?
<user1> A picture of my license plate was never taken .
<user0> Since there is no picture of your license plate on record , I'm going to let you go .
<user1> Thank you . I'm glad that you believe me .
<user1> Hi , Rita , I'm just looking for a pair of shoes . I won't be here for long .
<user0> Why not ? When I go shoe shopping , I have so many options for sneakers that I spend awhile looking at all of the choices .
<user1> That's my problem . I don't have a lot of options .
<user0> What do you mean ? This is a big store , isn't it ?
<user1> Yes , but I have unusually big feet . That wouldn't be too much of a problem except that they're also very wide , and only a few brands sell shoes that I can fit into .
<user0> So how do you usually go about buying shoes , then ?
<user1> Well , first of all , I can only go to certain stores that can guarantee me a large selection .
<user0> Well , you're in the right store . If they don't have it , no one will .
<user1> After that I choose something from one of the few brands that I know will fit me . I prefer white , so I ask them to bring me a pair of white sneakers in my size . Since I ' m usually only given one or two pairs of shoes that meet my qualifications , it makes it a very easy choice .
<user1> how about going to the Olympic souvenir store to have a look ? I remember there is one in the gym .
<user0> that's a good idea . I was thinking of buying some gifts for my family .
<user1> me , too . What did you have in mind ?
<user0> I haven't decided yet , but I think the Olympic Mascots are a must .
<user1> I agree . They're very lovely , especially " Huan Huan " .
<user0> is that the red one ? That is my favorite , too . Do you know how much they are ?
<user1> the five dolls are sold together as a set , and they're priced according to the size . The bigger they are the more expensive .
<user0> oh , I see . If I buy more than a set , can I get any discount ?
<user1> I don't think so . All the souvenirs of the Olympic Games are very hot right now .
<user0> any other ideas ?
<user1> there are lots of things , such as postcards , key chains , posters and various arts and crafts .
<user0> it all sounds great . We can go there after the match . I can't wait to see what they have .
<user1> You don ' t have to eat them . I don ' t mind .
<user0> Thanks mom ! Can I have dessert now ? I love chocolate cake !
<user1> No dessert for you unless you eat all your vegetables .
<user0> But I don ' t like them ! It ' s not fair !
<user1> You can have some fruit for dessert . If you eat an apple and a banana , I might let you have a small piece of chocolate cake .
<user0> Ok ... actually , I don ' t mind eating peas and carrots , buy I hate broccoli and cauliflower .
<user1> I ' ll remember that for next time . You ' ll get extra peas and carrots , buy no broccoli or cauliflower . OK ?
<user0> Thanks mom !
<user1> It ' s a pleasure to show our factory to our customers . What ' s your general impression , may I ask ?
<user0> Very impressive , indeed , especially the speed of your NW Model .
<user1> That ' s our latest development . A product with high performance . We put it on the market just two months ago .
<user0> The machine gives you an edge over your competitors , I guess .
<user1> Certainly . No one can match us as far as speed is concerned .
<user0> Could you give me some brochures for that machine ? And the price if possible .
<user1> Right . Here is our sales catalog and literature .
<user0> Thank you . I think we may be able to work together in the future .
<user1> Not completely . Our production process is partially-automated . We use robots on the production line for routine assembly jobs but some of the work is still done manually .
<user0> What about supply of parts to the production line ?
<user1> Well , the parts are automatically selected from the store room using a bar-code system . And there is an automatic feeder which takes them to the conveyor belt at the start of the production line .
<user0> What about the smaller components ?
<user1> They're transported to the workstations on automated vehicles - robot trucks - which run on guide rails around the factory .
<user1> Yeah , you get the TV to yourself while I spend my nights surfing the Net for missing classmates .
<user0> That's not why . This way I can see how you guys do this sort of thing .
<user1> I guess . Don't you have reunions in Taiwan ?
<user0> Definitely . Every year . But just for our forty-person class .
<user1> Ours are for everyone that graduated in the same year .
<user1> I'm the Project Manager so I have to make sure our projects run smoothly . I work with three Project Engineers . They take care of after-sales service and look after the maintenance side of the business .
<user1> Besides Chinese , I can speak English and French .
<user0> You mean you can read and write both of them ?
<user1> No , I can only carry on a simple conversation in French .
<user0> Can you read and write English well ?
<user1> I can speak the language better than read and write .
<user0> Do you speak the language well enough to communicate with people of English-speaking countries ?
<user1> I think so . I used to be an interpreter .
<user0> Do you think your English is good enough to do desk work ?
<user1> The amount of English I know enables me to do general desk work . I believe what I know is sufficient to work in an American firm .
<user1> Let me have a look . Well , how many kinds of steaks do you have ?
<user0> We have sirloin steaks , pepper steak , and filet steak .
<user1> Is there something go with the filet steak ?
<user0> Yes , we have various sauces . What about the gravy ?
<user1> Just a minute . I need to make a list of thinks that we need .
<user0> Good idea . Have you written down potatoes , carrots , and onions ?
<user1> I don ' t have onions on my list . I ' ll add them . We should get some tea . Is green tea ok or should we get the same tea that we usually get ?
<user0> Let ' s get both . We need some coffee too . Is that on your list ?
<user1> Yes , it is . Here ' s my list . Is there anything that I ' Ve forgotten ?
<user0> I think you ' Ve got everything . I want to got some chocolate and some cheese .
<user1> What kind of cheese do you want .
<user0> I ' m not sure . I ' ll decide at the cheese counter , when I can see what they have . Have we got enough money ?
<user1> We don ' t have enough cash , so I ' ll take my credit card and we can pay with that . Where are the car keys ?
<user0> I ' Ve got them there . Shall I drive ?
<user1> If you want to order meals , call 8801.If you need other help , call 8803 and someone will be there .
<user0> Thank you so much . By the way , is there a mail service ?
<user1> Yes , you can take your letters to the counter over there .
<user1> Of course you can . I am sure this one works very well . I just sent dozens of pages . How many pages are you sending ? Are you familiar with my fax machine ?
<user0> Yes , I think you have the same model as I have . Does your fax machine print out immediately a transmission protocol ?
<user1> Yes , it will print immediately .
<user1> Let me see , about five years , we established our business relationship with Hua Mei of China Import & Export Corporation in 2003 .
<user0> Do you have any difficulties in doing business in China ? You know the Chinese economic legislation is still incomplete ?
<user1> I don't think I have any problem with our Chinese partners . They have always followed the contract strictly . We can do business directly with the corporation . As I mentioned before , the Chinese government is trying very hard to perfect its law . Its commercial legislation provides legal protection for foreign companies .
<user0> Well , it's known that the Sino-American relation is in a dilemma . Does it influence your business in China ?
<user1> Actually not at present . But we are afraid it will . You know policies influence business to some extent . I hope our government will not be influenced by some extremists . China is really a large market . We don't want to lose it .
<user0> Thank you .
<user1> You're welcome .
<user1> Here you are . That will be five dollars . Anything else ?
<user0> Yes . I want some post cards and some airmail stamps . I want to send some letters to South America .
<user1> Just a moment , I'll look up the rate for air-mail letters to South America .
<user0> Can you tell me how much it will cost to send a package to Colombia ? Also , I what to know how long it will take .
<user1> Do you have the package with you ? I would have to weigh it to see how much it would cost .
<user0> Do you insure package ?
<user1> Yes . All you have to do declare the value of the package and decide how much you want to insure it for .
<user0> Is there a way that I can be sure that the people in South america receive my package ?
<user1> The post office rarely loses package . You can , however , request a rectum receipt .
<user0> One last question-what are your hours ?
<user1> We open at eight-thirty in the morning and close at five-thirty in the afternoon .
<user0> Thank you , you helped me a lot .
<user1> Hi there , I ' m Bill Gotcha , the owner of Gotcha Enterprises . Did you find your way here OK ?
<user0> Your assistant gave wonderful directions .
<user1> Why are you switching jobs at this point in your career ?
<user0> Our Company is moving overseas and I wish to stay in the United States .
<user1> What are you best at ?
<user0> I am good at organizing systems that have been having problems .
<user1> What is your biggest challenge in terms of skills ?
<user0> I don ' t like to sit around and so like to always find things to do to keep myself busy .
<user1> That is good to hear !
<user1> Good morning . I'd like to speak to Peter . Chen Please .
<user0> Certainly . Who should I say is calling ?
<user1> This is Tim . Hunter from Hunter industries .
<user0> And what is it regarding please ?
<user1> We have an appointment for this afternoon . Mr . Chen will know why I'm calling .
<user0> Of course , Please hold the line Mr . Hunter .
<user1> OK , what does that entail ?
<user0> It's not too much trouble to do it this way and remember , your certificate is due in 2 months . If you can hold on to it , it'll be much better for your finances .
<user1> Yes , it does seem a little silly to cash it now . I'll probably need about 25,000 RIB . Will that be a problem ?
<user0> Not at all , Mr Zu . As the certificate is due in 2 months , you can get the loan on mortgage of that certificate .
<user1> I'm glad you thought of this . I'd have just gone ahead and cashed it ! And I suppose I can use the money from the certificate to pay back this Personal Durable Commodities Loan and I won't lose any interest , right ?
<user0> Exactly right . If you'd like to go ahead , I can process that for you now , Mr Zu .
<user1> Absolutely , Jenny . Thanks very much , I think you've saved me quite a lot of money today .
<user1> I just got it at the special health store . It's for my flabby arms .
<user0> Let me know how it works .
<user1> I have to say , I have had enough of this roller coaster .
<user0> I know what you mean . I'm like a yo-yo .
<user1> Last week I was down to 60 kilos . This week I had one donut more . Now I'm up to 62 kilos .
<user1> Of course .
<user0> Could you tell me how this thing is cooked ?
<user1> Lobster ? It is steamed and served with our special sauce .
<user0> Is it good ?
<user1> Sure . It is a most popular dish .
<user0> I think I will try some lobster , and give me some green salad together .
<user1> Not yet , I must water the garden first .
<user0> Do you have to water it now ?
<user1> I ' m afraid I must . Look at it ! It ' s terribly dry .
<user0> What a nuisance !
<user1> Last summer it was very dry , too . Don ' t you remember ? I had to water it every day .
<user0> Well , I ' ll have tea by myself . That was quick ! Have you finished already ?
<user1> Yes , Look out of the window .
<user0> It ' s raining . That means you needn ' t water the garden .
<user1> That was a pleasant surprise . It means I can have tea , instead .
<user1> Why don't you have any money for another bus ?
<user0> I got hungry and bought some chips .
<user1> That was smart .
<user0> Anyway , do you have any change I can use for the bus ?
<user1> I don't have any .
<user0> I don't know how I'm going to get home .
<user1> Get a transfer from the bus driver .
<user0> How much is a transfer ?
<user1> It doesn't cost anything .
<user0> That's great ! Thanks for your help .
<user1> You know what ? Don't mention it .
<user1> Hello , doctor .
<user0> What's the matter ?
<user1> I've got a backache .
<user0> Do you often suffer from backache ?
<user1> No , I don't . I've never had a bad one before .
<user0> When did it start ?
<user1> About four days ago .
<user0> Well , go home and rest in bed for two days , then you'll feel better .
<user1> Can you give me some medicine ? It's very painful .
<user0> Yes , I'll give you some pills . Take one a time and three times a day , and come back in three days . If you don't feel ...
<user1> Here you are .
<user0> Your seat is three , in the third row , near the window .
<user1> Thank you . Where can I put my suitcase ?
<user0> Either in the overhead compartment or underneath the seat .
<user1> Everyone's attention , please . We are going to take off . Please fasten your belts .
<user1> Quite good . Excuse me , are there any places of interest ?
<user0> Yes , there are so many near our hoteI.Three blocks away from here , there is temple . It's famous for its building and paintings.lt ' s worth visiting .
<user1> Thank you . I think today we will go there .
<user1> Right . I'd like to deposit 2,000 RIB into my Current Account .
<user0> No problem . Could I have the cash and your Bank Book , please ? Oh dear ... there seems to be some problems here ...
<user1> What ? What's wrong ?
<user0> I'm sorry but 5 of these notes seem to be counterfeit . Look at this watermark , do you see it ?
<user1> It does look a little strange , I didn't notice that before .
<user1> Um ... Uh ... I'm just looking , thanks .
<user0> Need a gift for your girlfriend or wife ...
<user1> No , no , no . I'm just browsing . Thanks anyway .
<user0> Well , if you need anything , just ask .
<user1> Um ... well , where's the men's shoe department ?
<user0> It's on the third floor . Turn left when you get off the escalator .
<user1> Thanks .
<user1> I advise you to read Playboy.You can get a lot from it .
<user0> But there's quite a lot of rumors about it .
<user1> That's why it's interesting .
<user1> No , I don't . I left it home .
<user0> Sorry , but we can't do anything without the receipt . Come back with it .
<user1> I didn't know . I'll go to get it . How late will you be open ?
<user0> Till 5:30 .
<user1> I haven't heard anything .
<user0> My boss offered me a promotion , and I took it .
<user1> Are you serious ?
<user0> Yes , I am really excited .
<user1> That's great . Congratulations .
<user0> I appreciate that .
<user1> You have no idea how happy I am for you .
<user0> For real ?
<user1> I believe you were the best choice for that promotion . I really do .
<user1> I like Chinese food , too . I like dumplings best .
<user0> At school , we sometimes have Chinese food for lunch .
<user1> That's good . We eat Chinese food only at the Chinese restaurant .
<user0> My mother can make some Chinese food .
<user1> Really ? That's wonderful !
<user1> Does the class start again , Mam ?
<user0> Yes , but to the heath , this break has last long enough .
<user1> Oh , breaktime flies .
<user0> come on , baby . It ' s time now .
<user1> Mam , another minute , could I ?
<user0> Hurry up , little boy .
<user1> I feel dizzy and weak . And I'm having this pain in my ear . I think I am sick .
<user0> Are you often traveling by plane ?
<user1> No , this is the second time .
<user0> That's right . It's normal if you don't often take the plane . Just relax a little bit .
<user1> Why this happens to me when I am on the plane ? I feel bad .
<user0> Don't worry , sir . It's just because of the lower pressure .
<user1> What should I do about it ?
<user0> You may feel much better if you chew some gum or peanuts .
<user1> OK , thanks . Does it work really ? I'll give a try .
<user0> Are you feeling better now ? Do you need some pills ?
<user1> Much better . Thank you . I just feel tired but I can't fall asleep .
<user0> So , you'd better wear this eyeshade and you will sleep well .
<user1> I am not used to wearing that . Thanks .
<user0> If you try to adapt yourself to your destination's local time , you'll feel more comfortable . So please try to sleep , and have meals according to Los Angeles's time .
<user1> Thank you so much .
<user1> Yes , I ' m the manager here . What can I do for you , Madam ?
<user0> Did you have the room checked before we move in ?
<user1> Which room are you in ?
<user0> 1808 . The toilet doesn ' t work properly ; the water doesn ' t run in the shower .
<user1> I ' m awfully sorry to hear that . I ' ll turn to it right away .
<user1> Sure , but you have to pay $ 3 for it .
<user0> OK . Here you are .
<user1> Well , ou can't hear music until takeoff .
<user0> I see . Thank you .
<user1> What do you think of the pamphlets with beautiful pictures ?
<user0> That's nothing new .
<user1> I'll buy an electric map of the city .
<user1> Do you have any form of ID ?
<user0> I have my Tennis Club card . Is that good enough ?
<user1> I ' m afraid not . It has to be a passport or a valid driver ' s license .
<user0> Oh ... wait a minute ... here ' s my driver ' s license .
<user1> OK , just fill in this application . You can sit over there . This brochure explains our services . We have free checking , and you will be given a debit card and on ATM card . There is no service
<user0> OK , I ' ll fill out the form and come right back .
<user1> Hello . I'm not sure who I need to speak to . I got this 50 yuan note today and it seems a little odd to me .
<user0> The first thing we do is check the feel of the paper ;d oes it feel too thick or too thin ? Then we check the watermark . In my opinion it is counterfeit . I'll just run it through the scanner to double check .
<user1> What happens now ?
<user0> Well , it's our policy to confiscate all counterfeit notes . So , unfortunately you'll lose this 50 RIB . We'll give you a receipt to show the note has been confiscated .
<user1> I'm afraid I can't .
<user0> Why ?
<user1> Well , my car won't start . I don't know what's the matter with it .
<user0> Could it be the battery ?
<user1> No , I don't think it could be . I checked the battery two days ago.It must be other problems .
<user0> Well , I suppose it could be the gas .
<user1> No , there is plenty of gas . I filled it up yesterday .
<user0> Perhaps it's the starter then ?
<user1> Yes , that's possible .
<user1> I'm reading a novel , The mill on the floss , written by the famous novelist gorge alias .
<user0> What's it about ?
<user1> It's meanly about relationship between a brother and a sister , who live in the mill on the river floss . It describe there are childhood and disputes cause them to separate , the book ends with them ha
<user0> Is it difficult to understand ?
<user1> Not really , i would consider it easy .
<user0> Besides novels , any other types literary works that you indulgence .
<user1> I really like short stories .
<user0> Have you read anything else besides literature ?
<user1> Certainly I have . I like to read books on vary subjects , and i can read everything I can get my hands on in my spare time . I don't want to idle away and waste my time .
<user0> I agree . People who don't read are no better often people who can't read . I also agree that books are like food for the mind .
<user1> What kind do you have ?
<user0> We have Italian , French and Thousand Island .
<user1> Make it French please .
<user1> Not yet . But do you have any experience as an assistant ?
<user0> Yes . I have a lot of experience in that . I have worked for the sales company as an assistant since finishing my university .
<user1> OK . It sounds fine .
<user1> I'd like to have a look at your air conditioners . Hum , this one looks pretty good .
<user0> Yes , it ' s this summer ' s best-seller .

<user0> Yes , sometimes it happens , Ma'am . That's why it is always good to carry your confirmation number . I'm sorry about the inconvenience .
<user1> It's okay . It's probably my husband's fault.Is there a pool in this hotel ?
<user0> Yes , of course.The pool is open until 10:00 p . m . So you still have about 45 minutes .
<user1> Good .
<user0> Here is your key . Your room is 379.You can find the elevators just around that corner there , down the hall.Enjoy your stay , Ma'am .
<user1> Thank you .
<user1> Would you like to go by train or by bus ?
<user0> I am not sure , which one is better ?
<user1> The bus is cheaper but also slower . It will take about two-and-a-half hours .
<user0> And how long does the train take ?
<user1> If you take the fast train , it will take about 50 minutes .
<user0> Where do I catch the train ?
<user1> The trains for Cambridge leave from King's Cross Station . They run approximately every half hour . Most trains to Cambridge go from Platform 9 .
<user0> How do I get to King's Cross ?
<user1> The best way is to take an underground tube train directly to King's Cross . The Underground station is just round the corner from here .
<user0> Can you show me on the map ?
<user1> It is very easy . Just turn right when you leave and then turn right again at the first crossroads . The entrance to the Underground station is about 50 meters further on .
<user0> Thank you very much .
<user1> You're welcome .
<user1> From the numbers , it seems like Forest Inc . is our digest competitor ... Le'Ban and Markford are also major contenders in our market .
<user0> Le'Ban is the new kid on the block , it's amazing they've had such tremendous success so soon ... With them on the scene , the competition is outthrough .
<user1> here's information about our competitor's recent market activities ...
<user0> Thanks , this will be a big help in putting together next quarter's marketing strategies . With competition this intense , we'll have to step up production even more . We need a price we can compete with .
<user1> We're in a very competitive environment . It's sink or saimin this market .
<user0> Better start swimming ! we've got to find a way to outsmart the other guys . I want a preliminarily strategic marketing plan on my desk by next Tuesday ... the competition never sleeps and neither should we .
<user1> Hi . I would like to make a reservation on this Friday .
<user0> OK . What kind of room do you want ? We have single rooms , twin rooms , double rooms and suites available on Friday .
<user1> I want a single room with ocean view . Do you have one ?
<user0> Let me check . Yes .
<user1> OK . I will take it .
<user0> When do you check in ? How long are you planning to stay ? Do you have any special requirements ?
<user1> I guess I am going to arrive at 9:00 in the morning and I would like to leave at 200 in the afternoon on Sunday . Please give me a room away from the elevator . I hate noises while I am sleeping .
<user0> OK . No problem .
<user1> OK . Let me send a memo around .
<user0> Schedule it for this afternoon , when Ken gets back .
<user1> I don ' t think he ' s back today .
<user0> Oh , that ' s right . Go ahead anyways . I ' ll fill him in . We can ' t lose this order under any circumstances !
<user1> I know , it ' s a big one .
<user1> No . I don ' t . Please .
<user0> Are you in robust health ?
<user1> I have a little problem , I'm overweight for my height . I think I should go on a diet .
<user1> Is there anything wrong ?
<user0> We bought 1,000 sets of chemical instruments from you , but there are 40 not up to the standard .
<user1> It's hard for us to believe it . Our instruments have been the best quality for years . Have you any reliable evidence ?
<user0> Here is the survey report from a well-known public surveyor in London . You may inspect the defective instruments personally
<user1> Well . According to the contract , we are responsible for repairing or replacing those defective instruments . We ' ll send our technicians to repair them .
<user0> Forty faulty instruments means that 4 % are not up to the standard . You should compensate us for 4 % of the total account on the contract , as well as for the inspection fee .
<user1> I am sorry about the quality problem , but I propose we compensate you for 3 % of the total value apart from the inspection fee .
<user0> All right . In that case we are still willing to do business with you .
<user1> Oh where was that ?
<user0> I was running around the track at my college and there she was walking around the same track .
<user1> Grannie always tries to stay fit and healthy . She is always making us kids eat the proper foods .
<user0> Well , it pays off for her . How old is she anyway ?
<user1> She will be 86 next month .
<user0> That is truly amazing !
<user1> Yes . By the way , you are having a great make-up today . I like the color of your lipstick . So adorable !
<user0> Really ? It took me really a while to find the color . I am happy you like it .
<user1> Well , girls like us are happy to spend our time on those kinds of things . Actually , do we still have a meeting this afternoon ?
<user0> Sure , when those never ending meetings .
<user1> No , I haven't had the pleasure .
<user0> Come and meet her now .
<user1> All right .
<user1> Did you have hotel card or something ?
<user0> Let me see . Yes , I have the address and hotel telephone number here .
<user1> Oh , you stay at the down town Hilton . When you go down two blocks this way and turn left , you will find it on your right .
<user0> I don't understand very well . Could you give me a map ?
<user1> I did it myself . I went online and found a lot of website devoted to home improvement . Then I went to DIY shop and bought everything I needed . I ' m sure I saved a lot of money by doing it myself and it was fun too . I learnt a lot by doing it myself .
<user0> So , let ' s see . You have put new tiles on the floor and replaced a few tiles on the walls . You ' Ve also added a small cupboard for toiletries . The bath , shower , and washbasin are the same as before , aren ' t they ?
<user1> Yes , they are . I gave them a good clean . They are in good condition and don ' t need to be replaced .
<user0> How long did it take you to do the tiling .
<user1> As I hadn ' t done it before , I had to keep referring to income 3ation I got from the internet . Doing the floor tiles took a whole day-from early morning to right through to the evening . Then I spent a few hours replacing the cracked wall tiles . Putting the cupboard up took about an hour , so it took me two days altogether .
<user0> I think you ' Ve done a very good job . As least as good as a professional would do . Perhaps I can convince you to redo my bathroom ?
<user1> You ' ll be lucky ! However , I ' ll print out the income 3ation I got from the internet and you can do it yourself .
<user1> You mean this one ?
<user0> No , the other one in the brown case .
<user1> Oh , this one ... Here .
<user0> May I try it ?
<user1> Sure .
<user0> It's very smooth . I'll take it .
<user1> Cash or charge ?
<user0> Charge , please .
<user1> We have the offer ready for you . Let me see ... here it is . 100 cases Houston Bristles , 57 mm , at 10 pounds sterling per kilogram , C . I . F European Main Ports , for shipment in June 2001 . The offer is valid for five days .
<user0> Why , your price has soared . It ' s almost 25 % higher than last year ' s . It would be impossible for us to push any sales at such a price .
<user1> I ' m a little surprised to hear you say that . You know very well that markets for bristles have gone up a great deal in recent months . The price we offer compares favorably with quotations you can get elsewhere .
<user0> I ' m afraid I can ' t agree with you there . I must point out your price is higher than some of the quotations we ' Ve received from other sources .
<user1> But you must take the quality into consideration . Everyone in the trade knows that US ' s bristles are of superior quality to those from other countries .
<user0> I agree that yours are of better quality . But there ' s competition from synthetic products , too . You can ' t very well ignore that . Prices for synthetic bristles haven ' t changed much over the years .
<user1> There ' s practically no substitute for bristles for certain uses . That ' s why demand for natural bristles keeps rising in spite of cheaper synthetic ones . To be frank with you , if it were not for the long - standing relationship between us , we would hardly be willing to make you a firm offer at this price .
<user0> Well , we ' ll have a lot of difficulties in persuading our clients to buy at this price . But I ' ll have to try , I suppose .
<user1> Glad to meet you.Would you mind if I ask you some questions ?
<user0> Of course not .
<user1> Why do you want to go to the US ?
<user0> I'd like to have further education.Now I am studying for my doctorate .
<user1> Will you get any kind of scholarship ?
<user0> Yes . The school has provided me with full scholarship and that will be enough to support myself .
<user1> Yes . I graduated from shanghai University and later obtained a master's degree from Oxford .
<user0> What was your graduation thesis on ?
<user1> My graduation thesis is on International Trade .
<user1> Which account would you like to open ?
<user0> I'd like to open a savings account . What's the interest rate now ?
<user1> It is 3.2 % . You may earn a little interest on money .
<user0> Is there any minimum deposit for the first time ?
<user1> Yes , the opening minimum deposit is 1,000 Yuan .
<user0> What about the later deposits ?
<user1> For the later deposits , you can deposit any you want . Even one Yuan is OK .
<user0> OK , that's good .
<user1> Your ID , please .
<user0> Here you are , a thousand Yuan and my ID .
<user1> Wait a moment , please ... Here is your bankbook . Keep it well please .
<user0> Thanks . I will .
<user1> Yes , I went to Cambridge . After graduation , I started right away into the advertising industry . Later , I made a bit of a switch to focus on marketing research .
<user0> So , what experience do you have ?
<user1> I have ten years marketing experience . This includes both entry level and management positions . In my last position , I worked my way up to being director of the marking department .
<user0> I can see that from your resume.Your last position was marketing director for a pharmaceutical company , is that right ? Later , why did you decide to leave your former post ?
<user1> I felt after five years in one place , I was ready for something new . I would like to have a job that is challenging , something that I can see and do new things every day . I loved many things about my former job , and I left with amiable feelings on both sides . I was just ready for something new .
<user0> I see . Do you want to work full-time or part-time ?
<user1> I would rather work full-time .
<user0> I'll make note of that . Now , what are your salary expectations ?
<user1> I am willing to negotiate , but I expect at least $ 40,000 a year .
<user1> I feel sorry for you . It's a jungle out there .
<user0> Do you know any places ?
<user1> Well . I guess I can ask around to see if anyone's got a room or apartment available .
<user0> Thank you . I think I should also have a look at the Internet to see if anyone's got a sublet .
<user1> How much do are you looking to spend ?
<user0> I can only afford about 1,000 yuan a month .
<user1> Looks like you'll have to get a place in the suburbs .
<user0> It doesn't matter , but it needs to be close to the subway or on a convenient bus route .
<user1> Anything you need to have in the place ?
<user0> I want a bedroom with full bath , and it'll be better if the bedroom is on the sunny side .
<user1> You can also check out university bulletin boards .
<user0> Why ? Will those be students who are leaving ?
<user1> Not really , but landlords put up notices to attract students and they often have low rent .
<user0> Thank you . I'll be sure to take a look .
<user1> Good luck .
<user1> Certainly , sir . How much do you draw ?
<user0> RIB 8,000 , please . Would you please tell me my balance ?
<user1> Yes , sir . Your balance is RIB 34,000 .
<user1> Yes , I am , Your Honor .
<user0> What is your argument ?
<user1> Your Honor , the police officer pulled me over for speeding .
<user0> You must've been speeding .
<user1> No , Your Honor , I was not .
<user0> Tell me how many miles per hour you were going .
<user1> I was going 35 in a 40 mph zone .
<user0> That's fine , so I'll let you go with a warning .
<user1> So , I don't have to pay the ticket ?
<user0> You won't have to pay the fine .
<user1> Thank you very much , Your Honor .
<user1> How did you finally do it ?
<user0> A friend suggested that I stop nibbling between meals .
<user1> Like snacking ?
<user0> You know , a little piece of chocolate here , some chips on the side , candy now and then ...
<user1> I get what you mean .
<user0> Instead , I sit down and have a good snack like a piece of fruit between meals .
<user1> I'm impressed . Good for you !
<user1> OK ! We'll see it .
<user0> What kind of guarantee are you going to provide for us ?
<user1> We can provide you with standby letter of credit established by Bank of China .
<user0> Should we pay earnest money ?
<user1> Yes , you are supposed to pay it on time . If you don't furnish a tender bond on time , your tender will not be considered . Besides , you also should provide derailed engineering of the good .
<user0> Where do we submit the tender ?
<user1> To our office which is on the third floor .
<user0> Oh , I see . By the way , is tender-opening done publicly ?
<user1> Yes . All the bidders will be invited to join us to supervise the tender-opening .
<user0> And are the prices stated in the US dollar ?
<user1> Yes , so far as we know , in the field , your company has lots of experience and we hope you will consider the tender seriously .
<user0> OK ! We will . Bye !
<user1> Bye !
<user1> Tsingtao beer ?
<user0> Yes , sir . It's one of the best beers in China .
<user1> Really ?
<user0> Yes . The beer is brewed by using carefully selected malts , rice , hops and natural water from the Lao Mountain .
<user1> How about its taste ?
<user0> Fine , sir .
<user1> That sounds great . Two Tsingtao beers , please .
<user0> Tin or bottle ?
<user1> Tin , please .
<user0> Would you like it on the rocks , sir ?
<user1> No , thank you .
<user0> You're welcome .
<user1> Do you know various funds and accounts ?
<user0> Yes , I enjoy working with that .
<user1> Great . We have a very pleasant working condition and I think we have a fine staff to work with .
<user1> All right . Let me have a check . Can you tell me how can you inspect your exported goods ?
<user0> Our quality control department is in charge of the inspection , which is directly under general manager . It is essential to attach the importance to the quality of goods . It is the basement for the future cooperation .
<user1> That is good . And here I give you a piece of advice . You should have used stronger cardboard boxes for such a heavy item . Besides , it's better to secure the cartons with metal straps . What's more , the order number wasn't anywhere on some of the boxes .
<user0> I realize that now . I will do that after a while .
<user1> Thank you . Can I open the packages to check the color and style ?
<user0> Of course , let me help you .
<user1> The color and style are consistent with the sample . Great !
<user0> You know , we are superior to other clothes companies .
<user1> Yes , that's for sure . There is nothing wrong with the quality . I think you'd better pack them first in plastic bags , than in cartons .
<user0> OK . We will manage it later .
<user1> Honey , I have a lot of work to do .
<user0> So you can't go with us , right ?
<user1> No .
<user0> Daddy , you always arrange your schedule so tight on weekdays . You should have a rest on weekends .
<user1> What park do you want to go to ?
<user0> Daniel wants to go to the aquarium . While Mom wants to visit the Summer Palace .
<user1> Haven't we been these places already ?
<user0> Yeah . I don't agree with them , but I don't have a better choice .
<user1> What about the Olympic park ?
<user0> Right , ah . It is so close to our home . How come we've never thought of that ?
<user1> The Olympic Park has a small forest . It is fit for picnic .
<user0> Very well , Go ahead .
<user1> You are late . The last piece has sold out .
<user0> Really ? Is there ' Wall Street Journal ' , please ?
<user1> There are several , take a piece . The crash appears in the headline . It is famous for offering catastrophe stories .
<user0> I have a long flight for ten hours . I need to choose a magazine .
<user1> There are various magazines in the rack .
<user0> Give me the latest issue of ' National Geographic ' .
<user1> That's the top magazine in America and is popular with young people . OK . It is totally 30 dollars .
<user0> Here you are .
<user1> Have a nice trip .
<user1> I've been told about something called Southern Fund . How can I buy it ?
<user0> First of all , you should open a Fund Account with us , just fill in this form . We'll need to see some ID and your Cash Card .
<user1> That sounds simple enough . Do you charge any admin fees for that ?
<user0> You'll have to pay 20 RIB , and then you will have your Southern Fund Management company card .
<user1> Do you need any other documentation from me ?
<user0> Yes , we'll need to fill in this form , for fund trading and this one , for subscribing for and / or applying for purchasing fund units . The minimum is 500 RIB .
<user1> What ?
<user0> Don't take that tone with me ! I saw you hit your brother .
<user1> No ! He hit me first .
<user0> I don't care . You know better than to hit him . Go sit on your bed for 10 minutes .
<user1> No , I haven't .
<user0> She's really pretty .
<user1> Describe her to me .
<user0> She's not too tall .
<user1> Well , how tall is she ?
<user0> She's about 5 feet even .
<user1> What does she look like , though ?
<user0> She has pretty light brown eyes .
<user1> I may know which girl you're talking about .
<user0> So you have seen her around ?
<user1> Yes , I have .
<user1> I'm sorry ; he's out at the moment .
<user0> When do you expect him back ?
<user1> I think he'll be back in about an hour at least .
<user0> Well , may I leave a message ?
<user1> Yes , of course .
<user0> Would you please ask him to call Chris when he gets back ?
<user1> Ok . Does he know your number ?
<user0> I'm afraid he doesn't . My mobile is 139- 2477 - 4026 .
<user1> 13924774026 . All right . Thanks for calling . Oh , hang on , someone's at the door that may be him , please hold on .
<user1> Well , I think you'll like the mangoes .
<user0> I've never had a mango .
<user1> It's a fruit . It has a big stone in it .
<user0> Can you eat the stone ?
<user1> No . You would break all your teeth on it .
<user0> How much are these mangoes ?
<user1> The sale price today is $ 1 each .
<user0> Can you describe their taste ?
<user1> They usually taste sweet , but they remind me of an orange .
<user0> How can I tell if they're ripe ?
<user1> Don't cut into them until you can feel that they're soft on the outside .
<user0> What country produces them ?
<user1> They come from tropical countries .
<user1> Thank you .
<user0> From reading over your resume , I assume your English is quite good . Have you had any experience in the writing field ?
<user1> No , I haven ' t had any professional experience , but I have always been interested in creative writing .
<user0> Have you ever had a foreign instructor in English composition ?
<user1> Yes , my college teacher was an Australian . She was also our adviser on our English language newspaper . I was the editor for two years .
<user0> That ' s very interesting . Tell me what you did exactly .
<user1> Well , I planned the layout of the newspaper and then I assigned various articles and columns to other students to write . I wrote the editorial each time .
<user0> What is your aim in going into the field of journalism ?
<user1> To be frank with you , I would like nothing better than to be an overseas reporter some day .
<user0> That can be a rough job , you know .
<user1> Yes , I know that . But I like adventure and excitement in my writing .
<user0> Well , working in an editorial office may not be exciting enough for you . What do you think ?
<user1> I would be glad to do routine work sometimes , if I could be assured of making advancements in the future .
<user0> I think this type of position would be a very good start for you . I am quite sure we can work something out for you , but I cannot give you a definite answer today . We will let you know within just a few days .
<user1> Fine . Thank you very much .
<user1> Yes , of course.When ?
<user0> Will you be free this afternoon , say from 3 to 4 ?
<user1> Now let me check my schedule ... OK , you could to my office then .
<user1> Linda , this is David Wang .
<user0> Hi , Mr . Wang , what can I help you with ?
<user1> I need to talk with Marry .
<user0> Certainly , hold on .
<user1> Thanks .
<user1> Those are beautiful . They smell lovely . Thank you .

<user1> I'll do everything for you , love . You know that , maybe you didn't realize , but you made everyday a enjoys moment and happy occasion .
<user0> I am so glad we met one another .
<user1> I have a question .
<user0> Hush ... OK . What is it ?
<user1> Why do people like all this fancy , expensive underwear ?
<user0> What kind of question is that ?
<user1> I'm just curious . I think women are beautiful without this stuff .

<user1> I'm sorry about that , sir . I'll get you another one .
<user0> The thing is I've replaced once already . I think it's just a faulty batch .
<user1> I see . Maybe I can offer you a credit note .
<user0> Well . To be honest , that's not much use to me . I'll leave the country tomorrow . I'd really prefer a refund .
<user1> OK , sir . I'll see what I can do .
<user1> No , thanks . I've decided to give up smoking .
<user0> Really ? Why ?
<user1> Well , it's just that I think if you don't enjoy doing something any more , you should stop doing it .
<user0> I see.You mean you don't enjoy smoking any more ?
<user1> That's right . You should give it up , too.It ' s bad for your health .
<user0> Stop talking like my mother . That's what she keeps saying .
<user1> But it's true . It's a nasty habit . I can't think why I ever started.Anyway , it's obviously got you in its grip !
<user0> What do you mean ? What are you talking about ?
<user1> I mean you couldn't give it up !
<user1> Ok , what do you want me to do ?
<user0> First of all , I need you to do the drying up . I ' m almost finished the washing up . I ' m going to clean the cooker when I finish .
<user1> Ok . I ' ll put the plates and cutlery away as I dry them . Where is the tea towel ? Oh , here it is .
<user0> We ' ll have this finished in no time with two if us working on it .
<user1> While you ' re cleaning the cooker , I ' ll wipe the worktop . That was a great meat , by the way .
<user0> Actually , it was just some leftovers from yesterday . I made far too much food to eat alone . I am glad you could come over to help me finish it .
<user1> My pleasure ! This tea towel ' s a little ragged . Do you have another one ?
<user0> Yes . Look in that drawer . I should throw the old one out .
<user1> Keep it and use it as rag . You can clean your bicycle with it .
<user1> Sure , I ' d be glad to . What time frame did he have in mind ?
<user0> He ' d like to do it as soon as possible , sir . How about tomorrow at 2:45 ?
<user1> Mm , yeah , that ' ll be great . Tell him I ' ll see him then .
<user1> Well , depends . You see , there are eight famous Chinese food cuisines , for instance , sichuan cuisine and HUNAN cuisine .
<user0> There're all spicy or hot of heard .
<user1> That ' s right . If you have hot dishes , you can try some .
<user0> It might be too hot for me .
<user1> And there are Cantonese cuisine and Kiangsu cuisine .. Most people like them .
<user0> What about any special Beijing dishes ?
<user1> There ' re Beijing roast duck .
<user0> OH , yes . I heard of a lot of about it . I like very much to try it . Where can I find it ?
<user1> You can find it in most restaurant . The best place certainly is Quanjude restaurant .

<user1> Not too near but not too far either . A taxi will take you there in fifteen minutes . the traffic is not too bad , I mean .
<user0> Well , thank you for your information . What ' s the name of that restaurant again ?
<user1> Let me write it down on a piece of paper for you . You can show to the taxi driver .
<user0> That ' s very kind of you . Thanks a lot .
<user1> I ' d rather you didn ' t , Miss Yang . I ' m very busy now .
<user0> Can I try later then ?
<user1> Yes , of course .
<user0> Is it all right for me to come in now , Mr Sun ?
<user1> Well , uh ... I ' m still pretty busy , but ... all right . Come in . What can I do for you ?
<user0> Do you mind if I sit down ?
<user1> Not at all . Take a seat . Now what can I do for you ?
<user0> I want to leave the department . Do you think I could put info a transfer ?
<user1> Yes . But why should you want to do that ?
<user0> Do you mind if I speak frankly ?
<user1> Not at all . Go ahead .
<user0> Well . You see , I don ' t like the office . I don ' t like the staff . And I ' m afraid of you . And I don ' t want to go one . So may I put info a transfer ?
<user1> Yes . I ' d be delighted if you did .
<user1> Yes , could I make a reservation to New York on July 21st , next Friday ?
<user0> Sorry , there is no flight available on July 21st .

<user0> It departs at 12:10 and arrives at 15:10 next day .

<user1> Yes , many thanks . Goodbye .
<user0> Bye .
<user1> Sure , Richard . What ' s on your mind ?
<user0> Well , to be honest , I just don ' t think we ' re going to have enough funds to give the kind of bonuses you have in mind .
<user1> Well , why don ' t we sit down and work out the numbers ? We can always scale down the bonuses if we have to .
<user1> So you have to open all the envelopes .
<user0> Yes , except the personal mail . And I also need to prepare the materials for posting and check the e-mail box regularly .
<user1> Do you need to file copies of the letters before sending them ?
<user0> Yes , and I check all the e-mails for Mr . Thomas .
<user1> I take care of the letters . I may read , sort out and organize incoming mails .
<user0> So you have to open all the envelopes .
<user1> Yes , except the personal mail . And I also need to prepare the materials for posting and check the e-mail box regularly .

<user1> Red roses are always a popular gift for birthdays .
<user0> What are the roses going for ?
<user1> They're only $ 20 a dozen .
<user0> That sounds nice and cheap .

<user0> Yes , I am a volunteer for the campaign .
<user1> I am very impressed .
<user0> I feel that history is about to be made , and I want to be a part of it .
<user1> That is very nice of you .
<user0> Will you be voting ?
<user1> Yes , I am going to vote .
<user0> Make sure you make it to your polling place early on Election Day .
<user1> Thank you and good luck .
<user1> If the weather is good , I'll go to climb mountains .
<user0> Are you going with your friends ?
<user1> No , I'm going alone .
<user0> Oh , aren't you afraid ?
<user1> Of course not . For me , mountaineering is both relaxation and a hobby .
<user0> I think mountaineering is an exciting sport , but a little dangerous .
<user1> Yeah , you are right , but it's really interesting .
<user1> What does it do ?
<user0> It's got a built-in video camera so you can see the person you're talking to.It also takes stills and I can use the E-mail mode to send digital pictures straight to my friend's phone !
<user1> Wow ! What else does it do ?
<user0> I can plug it into a folding keyboard to type in message mode . l can even surf the net .

<user1> American .
<user0> What's your relationship with the victim ?
<user1> I don't know him .
<user0> Why did you attack the victim ?
<user1> Because he beat me first when I tried to stop him from grabbing my bag and running away .
<user0> How many times did you stab the victim ?
<user1> I stabbed his belly three times .
<user0> Did you know hat your actions might cause serous injuries or death ?
<user1> I knew , but I couldn't control myself .
<user0> Was it your intention to kill the victim ?
<user1> No . I didn't kill him on purpose , madam . It's him who caused the incident . I need to see my attorney .
<user0> OK . Give me his number and we'll contact him .
<user1> Today I'm here to find out about paying in foreign currency . You do that here , I suppose ?
<user0> Yes , of course . What would you like to know ?
<user1> My nephew has told me about something called a ' timing deposit ' or something like that ?
<user0> A T-I-M-E , Time Deposit . You can chose from 5 different grades
<user1> Put me down for 2 years . Here's the money I'd like to pay in ...
<user1> No . you ' re going the wrong way . You wanna 103 from the Beijing zoo .
<user0> how can I get it , please ?
<user1> You get off at the next stop , cross the street and you will find the stop not far on the right hand side .
<user0> could I have a transfer , please ?
<user1> Here you are .
<user0> Thank you .
<user1> Can't I play more ?
<user0> No ! Stop playing computer games !

<user1> About 12 hours .
<user0> I always have trouble with jet lag .
<user1> Most people do when they travel long distances .
<user0> By the way , what's the time now ?
<user1> 8: 00 Beijing time .
<user1> This is a special adhesive for easing the pain . Apply it to the painful area and change it in every 2 days .
<user0> How do I use the lotion ?
<user1> Apply some of the ointment , and rub it into the skin .
<user0> Well , thanks very much .
<user1> Not at all .
<user1> Oh , Brian . That ' s really sweet of you guys . I would love to get together with all of you . How about Friday ?
<user0> Great ! What time ?
<user1> I ' m free all afternoon . Why don ' t we meet at 1 o ' clock in the lobby ?
<user1> I ' ll be glad to . But my schedule is super tight this week . I think the only time I have free is at lunch on Wednesday .
<user0> That ' s fine . I can make that .
<user1> All right , then . I ' ll see you at noon on Wednesday .
<user1> How long have you been feeling this way ?
<user0> It all started the day before yesterday .
<user1> You seem to have picked up some kind of infection .
<user0> What should I do ?
<user1> Take a few days off from work and don't wear yourself out .
<user1> I'm not sure , what about you ?
<user0> Do you think Kentucky fried chicken is good ?
<user1> Sure sounds good to me .
<user1> No , not yet .
<user0> Well , when were you planning on doing that ?
<user1> I'm going to clean it up later .
<user0> Didn't I ask you to clean it up earlier ?
<user1> I'm going to clean it .
<user0> I want you to vacuum in your room , and don't forget to dust everything .
<user1> I know . I'll do it .
<user0> Make sure you clean it up before you do anything else .
<user1> I'm not going anywhere until later , so I'll clean it then .
<user1> I'm from Lexington Software and I'm here to collect an export L / C .
<user0> I have it right here .
<user1> Great . Can I take it with me now ? Or do you need me to fill in some forms or something ?
<user0> No , you can take it away now . I just need you to sign here .
<user1> Here you are .
<user0> Just one thing before you go , could you please prepare your documents in accordance with the L / C within the validity period ?
<user1> No problem , I'll get on that right away . Thanks , bye .
<user1> What do you need ?
<user0> I need to talk to you about that new driver you ' Ve hired . I think I am going to have some problems working with him .
<user1> He seems to be quite qualified . If it is a personal problem I preferred if you would work out between yourselves .
<user1> Oh , my dear lady . Take it easy . You should forgive a green hand like him .
<user0> He does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy .
<user1> I suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems .
<user0> I have told him how to do it several times , but he's never listened to me .
<user1> Maybe you should communicate with him just like a friend and not a boss .
<user0> Oh , I always have difficulty in getting along with the staff .
<user1> Just take them for your good friends and have a talk with them as we do , make sure you don't lose your temper .
<user0> I think that's a bad idea . I'd hate anyone here to think of me as a friend . How would they ever respect me as they can do whatever they want ?
<user1> I disagree . All you have to do is respect the staff and their opinions .
<user1> yeah , you know what ? I've been going to the club regularly . The training really pays off . Now I am in a good shape and I know more about how to keep fit .
<user0> really ? tell me about it . I haven't gone to the club for a long time . I am too busy with work .
<user1> it's important to do proper exercises .
<user0> you're right . Too much or too little won't do any good .
<user1> the trainer tells me , besides regular sports activities , I should also have a healthy and balanced diet .
<user0> sounds reasonable .
<user1> we should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic .
<user0> and fruits !
<user1> surely it is . Getting enough sleep is also crucial for fitness .
<user0> I've heard that . Does your trainer tell you anything about keeping fit ?
<user1> yeah , he advises me to stay in a good mood . That can help one to keep sound physical health .
<user0> I think if you follow your trainer's advice , you'll be on the right track .
<user1> you bet it !
<user1> I stayed with my friends .
<user0> You should at least give me a call .
<user1> I'm sorry , Mum .
<user1> Just Mr . White .
<user0> What did he want ?
<user1> He wouldn't say over the phone .
<user1> I want to do some management job since I have three-year's work history .
<user0> What are your plans if you were hired ?
<user1> I would apply my specialty and experience to my job and gradually move up to the management level in this company .
<user1> Sorry . I didn't mean to .
<user1> while I think it's great that they're trying to get people to quit smoking , but I don't really care for the advertisement .
<user0> why not ?
<user1> the fish hook that they use is quite disturbing !
<user0> it's a pun . They use the fish hook to make you think about how you can get hooked on smoking .
<user1> I know , but I think it's not really appropriate for young children .
<user0> I think they're trying to scare the young people so that they don't ever start smoking .
<user1> all advertisers like to catch young people because they know the meaning of loyalty .
<user0> perhaps you're right , , though . Maybe the advertisement would be more effective with adults anyhow .
<user1> I have nothing against them putting the advertisements in magazines and newspapers that are read by adults , but I don't think they should have their ad on billboards where children can see them .
<user0> that's a good point . I think I was so delighted to see that a billboard was being used to promote health that I didn't think about how children might understand the ad .
<user1> you have to give them credit , though . It's about time people started becoming more aware of the dangers of smoking .
<user1> This is he . Who ' s calling , please ?
<user0> This is Chris Emerson speaking .
<user1> Hello , Chris . How can I help you ?
<user1> Certainly . A letter must be sent out of the company and must be mailed or posted . A memorandum is a communication within an organization .
<user0> Should we use the layout we use for a letter when we write a memorandum ?
<user1> No , not necessary . Usually we have a set form which is printed . We just fill in the printed forms and send it to the person or the offices concerned in the company .
<user0> Of course , let me find one for you .
<user1> Sorry , it ' s all sold out .
<user0> Well , do you have any for tomorrow ?
<user1> We have tickets for the matinee . It starts at 3p . m .
<user0> Ok . I ' ll take it .
<user1> Where would you like to sit ?
<user0> Do you have anything in the middle section ? I want a good view , but sitting too close hurts my eyes .
<user1> Certainly .
<user1> Cancelled ? That's just can't happen !
<user0> Sorry to say , but nothing can be done . The equipment broke down and can't be fixed till Friday .
<user1> Oh , I hope it be fixed on Friday .
<user1> Yes . I would like to place a collect call .
<user0> Can you tell me the name and number of the person you want ?
<user1> Terry and his number is 4562325 8 .
<user0> Please wait a moment . It Will take a few seconds to get through .
<user1> I would be happy to help . What would you like me to help with , food or entertainment ?
<user0> I would like to help you with both .
<user1> That will work out fine . To make sure everything goes together , do you think this party should be casual or dressy ?
<user0> A dressy party would be fun !
<user1> That will work out fine . Do you think that Chinese or Continental food would be best ?
<user0> We should probably have both .
<user1> Yes , that will work out fine . Should we hire a band or bring in a DJ ?
<user0> Maybe we could do both !
<user1> Everything sounds great then ! I'll meet you back here on Friday to discuss the details .
<user1> It's right here . $ 100 .
<user0> But I heard other stores were having great mark-downs on this item .
<user1> Ours are of really good quality .
<user0> I see , please wrap it .
<user1> Well , I swim and run every day .
<user0> Now , tell me , what do you eat ?
<user1> Well , I don't eat any meat , but I do eat fish and eggs .
<user0> Do you eat a lot of vegetables ?
<user1> Oh yes , and fruit , I love fruit .
<user0> What do you drink ?
<user1> Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . They are very bad for you .
<user0> What do you drink ?
<user1> There's a taxi rank over there , right outside the gate .
<user1> The fundraiser events went really well . We were able to partner with a few of our competitors , all in fun of course , to sponsor a marathon for the American Cancer Society . All of the people who participated it had a great time , and we were able to raise a lot of money to contribute to cancer research .
<user0> So how does it work ? How were you able to make money with the marathon ?
<user1> Each of the runners that participated the marathon race paid a ten dollar entrance fee . Also , they went door to door to get sponsors who pledged a dollar per mile that participants ran . All in all we were able to raise several thousand dollars .
<user0> Sounds like a great deal for the American Cancer Society .
<user1> In all honesty , it's also a great deal for our company . The exposure that we gained from sponsoring an invent like this was great for our image in the community . We accomplished as much as last year's advertising campaign , plus we were able to do a little fundraising for a good cause .
<user1> I need to open a second account .
<user0> What kind of account would you like to open ?
<user1> I need another savings account .
<user0> Do you have another account with us ?
<user1> I sure do .
<user0> Would you like to transfer money from that account into your new one ?
<user1> That ' s fine .
<user0> How much would you like to transfer ?
<user1> Transfer $ 100 .
<user0> Give me a moment while I complete your transaction .
<user1> That ' s fine . Thank you .
<user1> I have been doing quite well . As reach 90 % and Bs reach 100 % . And I ' Ve received Scholarship two times .
<user0> Besides your major , do you know some in other fields ?
<user1> Yes . To develop my knowledge , I studied Economics , Business Administration and Accountingthrough self-study . Nowadays , I have passed three courses on CPA .
<user0> Have you ever been a student cadre ?
<user1> Yes . I used to be the monitor of my class .
<user0> Did it affect you much ?
<user1> It ' s a very important experience for me . First , it improved my organizing ability , and let me understand how to resolve a problem in the overall perspective instead of my own perspective . Second , it let me know how to cooperate in harmony with people who I like or dislike .
<user0> In your spare time , do you have any part time jobs ?
<user1> Yes , I used to work as an assistant lawyer for Tienda Law Office .
<user1> An old one .
<user0> I know it's old , but what make is it ?
<user1> It's a Chevrolet . Why do you ask ? You going into the car business ?
<user0> Nothing like that . My cousin is going to take a job overseas and he can't take his car with him , so he's going to sell it - cheap . It's practically new .
<user1> well I have been thinking about getting a newer car . I can't afford a brand new one .
<user0> Would you like to look at my cousin's car ?
<user1> Is it a four-door or a two-door ?
<user0> It's a coupe with a vinyl roof .
<user1> Does it have automatic transmission ? .
<user0> Yes , and it also has power steering , power brakes , and air conditioning .
<user1> I guess I might take a look at it .
<user1> Your main job is serving the clients and giving them what they want .
<user0> What other things do I need to know ?
<user1> You'd spend 30 % of your time on the computer . You may be bored with a job like that .
<user0> No problem . I am used to it .
<user1> Yes , I ' m here to see Joanna Stevens . I have an appointment at four .
<user0> Certainly , may I take your name ? I ' ll let her know you ' Ve arrived .
<user1> Sure , it ' s Josh O ' Neil .
<user0> Ms . Stevens will be with you momentarily . Can I offer you something to drink ?
<user1> Yes , a coffee would be nice , thank you .
<user0> Here you are . Ms . Stevens is ready for you now . I ' ll show you to her office , right this way .
<user1> They turned me down .
<user0> Why ? You are so excellent .
<user1> I think the only reason is that I was too nervous during the interview and I couldn't express myself the way I wanted to .
<user0> What a shame ! You should have showed yourself to them !
<user1> It doesn't matter . I'll try other companies .
<user0> I suggest you hunt for a job on the Internet .
<user1> On the Internet ? I've never heard of it .
<user0> It's very convenient and it has become popular recently .
<user1> Is that safe ?
<user0> Of course , if you log on some standard websites .
<user1> Thank you for your advice . I'll have a try .
<user1> OK . How much is the fare ?
<user0> The total is 45 yuan .
<user1> 45 yuan ? It is too much , Are you sure ?
<user0> It is 45 yuan on the meter .
<user1> Is there something wrong with your meter ?
<user0> No . I am sure about that .
<user1> OK . Could you give me a receipt ?
<user0> Yes . This is your receipt .
<user1> Not at all .
<user0> Oh , thank you . That ' s very kind of you .
<user1> You ' re welcome . I prefer a window seat .
<user0> Oh , you do ? Good . Looking out of the window sometimes scares me . So I prefer to be the man in the middle .
<user1> Yes , I have been always learning the Economics on my own . My dream is to get a master's degree in Economics .
<user0> If you make every effort to the company , you will have a great chance to attend the on-the-job postgraduate . The tuition fee will be financed by our company .
<user1> Really ? It is amazing . I will apply for a position in your company .
<user1> What's it look like , lady ? This is the ticket line I'm standing in , isn't it ?
<user0> Well , yes , it is , but ...
<user1> So , what's your beef anyway , lady ?
<user0> You just cut into line , in front of me and everyone else , that's what ! Go take your place back at the end of the line , like every - one else !
<user1> Oh sure , lady , and fat chance I'd get a ticket before they're sold out . I'm staying right here , understand ? So be a nice lady and butt out !
<user0> Just what gives you the right ... ?
<user1> Because I'm no sucker ; only suckers go to the end of the line . It's as simple as that , lady .
<user0> Well , you're no gentleman , either .
<user1> Okay , lady , just to show what a gentleman I really am , I'll let you go in front of me . Now , just buy your ticket and shut your trap , will you , lady ?
<user0> Whew ! I got the last one . This must be my lucky day !
<user1> What was that you just said ? Last one ... ? Hey , they've closed the ticket window !
<user0> Yes , I'm afraid I bought the last ticket , and to think , if you hadn't been such a gentleman . . .
<user1> Lady ! This is unfair ! I've been cheated ! I was in line before you.That should have been my ticket ! Come on , hand it over , lady !
<user0> Gentleman ! Hah ! Fat chance ! Hah ! Eat your heart out , sucker ! Hah !
<user1> Yes . Fill it up , please .
<user0> Premium or regular ?
<user1> Regular , please .
<user0> Anything else , sir ? Should I check the water and the oil ?
<user1> Yes , please .
<user1> Take care ! I will miss you so much .
<user1> I haver run out of gas .
<user0> What kind of oil do you want ?
<user1> Premium , please . By the way , please don't fill it up . Two gallons will be fine .
<user0> No problem .
<user1> Can we go somewhere nearby ? I don't feel like walking too far .
<user0> Sure . What kind of food do you like ?
<user1> I mean the food for something spicy .
<user0> How about some Korean food ? There's a place right there on the corner .
<user1> That sounds great . I love Korean food .
<user1> Yes . I ' m trying to find a pair of earrings to match my necklace . Can you recommend some to me ?
<user0> Yes . Your gold necklace has a diamond pendant , and your eardrops should be
<user1> These look wonderful . Do these come with a guarantee of quality ?
<user0> Of course . If there is anything wrong with them , you can come back and show me the guarantee of quality , and then you will surely get free service .
<user1> I ' ll take them .
<user1> Oh , dear . What was in it ?
<user0> All my money .
<user1> Well . Go to the police station and see if it ' s there .
<user1> Yes . I urgently need a room for tomorrow night , and do you have any vacancies ?
<user0> Yes , we have . What kind of room would you like ?
<user1> I'd like a suite with an ocean view , please .
<user0> No problem , sir .
<user1> Good morning ! I am Anna Lu . I've come for an interview which was arranged .
<user0> Oh , I see . I am Jack White , Personnel Manager . Take a seat , please .
<user1> Glad to meet you , Mr . White .
<user0> Miss Lu , have you got any experience in restaurant service ?
<user1> Yes . Since I entered college , I have been working at a fast food restaurant as a part-time waitress .
<user0> For how long ?
<user1> 3 years .
<user0> Our restaurant receives a lot of foreign customers . Can you serve them in English ?
<user1> That's why I applied for this job . Now I am studying Hotel English in my college , and I am quite familiar with the western courtesy and restaurant etiquette . I am sure my public relation skills will leave a strong impression on your customers .
<user0> You must know our working hours are very long and overtime work is frequent .
<user1> I don't mind that .
<user0> I think I will give you a 3 months ' trial . The salary for this period is 800 yuan a month with no bonus . After that period if we both feel satisfied , a formal contract would be signed .
<user1> When am I supposed to start working ?
<user0> Next monday . Bring your resume and diploma with you .
<user1> Yes , I will . Thank you , Mr . White . Goodbye !
<user0> Goodbye !
<user1> I'm afraid so .
<user1> Sure . Why don ' t you try it on ? The fitting room is over there .
<user0> It ' s just the right size-a perfect fit ! Have you seen anything you like ?
<user1> I ' m thinking about buying this sweater . I know it ' s June now , but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
<user0> It looks too big for you , but I like the color and the material is good quality . Is it on sale ?
<user1> Yes , it ' s half price . It ' s supposed to be too large--that ' s the fashion .
<user0> I might get one too , but in a different color . I prefer light blue to white 。
<user1> There.It looks great , don ' t you think ? I ' m going to get these jeans as well . I need a new pair . I ‘ m also going to buy this scarf ready for winter .
<user0> I ' m getting this beret ? Doesn ' t it look cool ? I ' d like to get some jeans too , but I don ' t have enough cash on me .
<user1> Don ' t worry . I ' Ve got my credit card . You can pay me back later .
<user0> Thanks ! Now I don ' t need to come back to the shop a second time .
<user1> This is Mr Brown speaking . I'd like to speak to Mr . Thomas , please .
<user0> I'm sorry , but Mr.Thomas left the office a few minutes ago .
<user1> That's bad ! I've been trying to call him for the last ten minutes , but your line has been busy . Will he be back soon ?
<user0> I'm afraid not . He's gone for the rest of the day .
<user1> Is there anywhere I can reach him ?
<user0> I don't believe so . He's going out of town on business . May I take a message ?
<user1> I have a business appointment with him for tomorrow morning at ten o'clock , but I'm afraid I can't make it .
<user0> Would you care to make another appointment ?
<user1> Unfortunately , I'm leaving town rather unexpectedly , and I may be gone for several days .
<user0> I see . I can tell Mr.Thomas that you phoned .
<user1> Thank you .
<user0> Bye-bye .
<user1> There ' s an interesting interview with a top fashion designer about the latest fashions . I enjoyed reading her thought . The “ which ? ” section is very interesting this month . They tested facial cleaners . The article recommends “ all clear ” for effectiveness and price .
<user0> I like to take the tests that they print in this magazine .
<user1> Which tests do you mean ?
<user0> You know . Tests like ” how jealous are you ? ” and “ are you a fashion victim ? ”
<user1> Oh , I see . I like to do those tests , too , but I don ' t take them seriously .
<user0> Of course not , but sometimes the results make you think about yourself and what you do . According to the jealousy test , I ' m quite a jealous type of person . Perhaps I need to control my jealousy .
<user1> Hi Marry , this is Tom .
<user0> How can I help you ?
<user1> I need to see if we can get together today .
<user1> Do we need to put on the jackets too ?
<user0> You ' d better , to protect your clothes . Now please watch your step .
<user1> Thank you . Is the production line fully automated ?
<user0> Well , not fully automated .
<user1> I see . How do you control the quality ?
<user0> All products have to go through five checks in the whole manufacturing process .
<user1> What ' s the monthly output ?
<user0> One thousand units per month now . But we ' ll be making 1,200 units beginning with October .
<user1> What ' s your usual percentage of rejects ?
<user0> About 2 % in normal operations .
<user1> That ' s wonderful . Is that where the finished products come off ?
<user0> Yes . Shall we take a break now ?
<user1> With pleasure .
<user0> Thanks you . Shall we stand a bit further ? I would like to take the tower in .
<user1> No problem .
<user0> That's OK . If you want the photo I will mail it to you .
<user1> No need , sir .
<user1> Can you give me the number for Jessica Hanson on locks Ave ?
<user0> I ' m sorry . There is no listing under that name . Are you sure of the name ?
<user1> Yes , I ' m pretty sure .
<user0> Do you have her address ?
<user1> Yes , I do . It ' s 109 Locks Ave , L8V 4N9 .
<user0> That ' s an unlisted number . I ' m sorry , but I can ' t give it to you .
<user1> I see . Thanks anyway .
<user0> No problem .
<user1> Ok , you have to fill out the form . And I let me see three identification cards or documents .
<user0> I have the driver ' s license , a membership card and my passport . Would we do ?
<user1> Let me see them . Yes . There ' re ok .
<user0> What ‘ s the minimum amount I can deposit in an account ?
<user1> You can deposit and ensure amount of ten dollars .
<user0> Thank you .
<user1> You will receive the tender notice next month and you'll find the information .
<user0> OK ! Our company is very interested in the tender . I am sure that we will do our best to win the bidding in building the factory .
<user1> I believe your corporation will try your best and I understand fully your feeling , if your tender conditions proved be suitable for our general conditions of tender , we will accept your submission of tender .
<user0> Maybe I have asking too many questions today .
<user1> That's all right . You can contact me later if you have other questions after you read the tender notice .
<user0> Fine , thanks a lot . Bye !
<user1> Bye !
<user1> Yes , we had a meting about it yesterday afternoon .
<user0> What's the answer ?
<user1> We decided that we could agree to your price , but we are a bit worried about the slow delivery .
<user0> Let me see . I quoted your delivery in three months , didn't I ?
<user1> Yes , but we hope that the wool could reach us as soon as possible .
<user0> I thought you would be worried about it . So I rang Auckland last night . As you are our biggest customer , they agreed to ship the order on the first vessel available that will leave Auckland next month .
<user1> Good , if you agree we'll draft the agreement right away and sign it then .
<user0> By all means .
<user1> What happened ?
<user0> I spilled my drink .
<user1> Speaking .
<user0> Ah , hello , Mr Was . I'm just calling about your new credit card . It has arrived with us , so you can either come to collect it , or we can send it on to you .
<user1> Sending it won't be necessary . I'm actually coming in for a meeting with my Personal Banker this afternoon .
<user0> What perfect timing !
<user1> Indeed . Is there anything I need to do before I collect it ?
<user0> Not really . But we do recommend you to read through our terms and conditions again before you sign the card , just in case there is something you aren't happy with .
<user1> I'm sure it'll be fine . How about my PIN number ?
<user0> That will be sent on to you within 2 working days . Then , you can start using your new card .
<user1> Great . I'll be in later today . Thanks for calling . Bye .
<user1> I have no idea . What about you ?
<user0> I kind of want pizza .
<user1> I ate pizza the other day .
<user0> So , what do you feel like eating then ?
<user1> How about some burgers ?
<user0> I already had a burger yesterday .
<user1> What are we going to do ?
<user0> We can just each get what we want to get .
<user1> That sounds like a plan .
<user0> Do you know a place that sells pizza and burgers ?
<user1> I think they sell both at the cafeteria .
<user1> Yes , here is my Certificate of Nurse .
<user0> How about your nursing education ?
<user1> I learnt nursing through theory and practice for 3 years at Hunan Nursing School .
<user0> Can you manage English conversation ?
<user1> Yes , pretty well . I have started learning English since primary school .
<user1> My husband and I have thought about it , but we've decided not to have any . They're just too expensive . Besides , with all the news about global warming on the news lately , who knows what kind of Worl
<user0> Well , I've always wanted to have lots of children . Growing up with only one brother , I always felt a bit lonely . What do you think about families with only one child ?
<user1> For me , growing up in a big family always made me yearn for attention . I always wanted to be an only child so that I could always do what I wanted and so that I wouldn't ever have to share .
<user0> Don't you think you would miss having other people around ?
<user1> No way ! I spent 20 years of my life with relatives around me 24-7 . You know , I don't think I've ever actually spent any time by myself in my parents ' home . What do you think fo the one-child policy
<user0> If China didn't have such a policy , can you imagine how many people there would be in China now ?
<user1> That's true . But as a woman , I'm glad that even though I don't want any children , I at least have a choice in how many children I have . On the other hand , I can't imagine what China would be like
<user0> Do you think most families with many children envy or feel sorry for other families with only one child ?
<user1> I don't know what other people think , but I , for one , envy only children !
<user1> I know , I know . OK , so I have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine .
<user0> Right . You have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing . For example for delicates , you should set a shorter washing cycle . Also , be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing .
<user1> So complicated ! Ok , what about this red wine stain ? How do I get it out ?
<user0> Since this is a white t-shirt , you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .
<user1> Cool . Then I can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it ' s all set right ?
<user0> No ! Since you are washing delicates and cotton , you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
<user1> You know what ? I ' ll just have everything dry cleaned .
<user1> No , he is at work now .
<user0> May I have his office phone number please ?
<user1> Sure . It's 289,1234 .
<user1> Driving ? No way , it's too far .
<user0> I just thought it would be an interesting way to see lots of places . How long will it take ?
<user1> Too long , and you do not have much time .
<user0> What a pity .
<user1> Thank you .
<user0> Could you tell me which bags are yours ?
<user1> They're over there next to the door . Those three with green tags on them .
<user0> Could you wait a moment ? I have to get a trolley . May I see your room key , please ?
<user1> Sure , here it is .
<user0> Thank you . Room 402 . You're on the 4th floor . This way , please .
<user1> Yes . I bought the can two days ago , but today I found that is beyond the guarantee period .
<user0> Let me see . I am sorry , sir . We will change another one for you . Please wait a moment .
<user1> The railway station ? Just go down this street and turn left at the second corner . The station is at the end of that street .
<user0> How long will it take me to get there ?
<user1> It's about a ten-minute walk .
<user0> That's very clear . I think I can find my way now . Thank you .
<user1> Not at all .
<user1> No , You're got on the wrong bus . You can take a No . 22 bus at the University station and then transfer to a No . 83 bus at the railway station .
<user0> OK ! Thank you very much !
<user1> Good , if you ' ll excuse me , I ' ll go over the sheet right now .
<user0> Take your time .
<user1> I can tell you at a glance that your prices are much too high .
<user0> I ' m surprised to hear you say so . You know that the cost of pro - duction has been skyrocketing in recent years .
<user1> We only ask that your prices be comparable to others . That ' s reasonable , isn ' t it ?
<user0> Well , to get the business done , we can consider making some concessions in our price . But first , you ' ll have to give me an idea of the quantity you wish to order from us , so that we may adjust our prices accordingly .
<user1> The size of our order depends greatly on the prices . Let ' s settle that matter first .
<user0> Well , as I ' Ve said , if your order is large enough , we ' re ready to reduce our prices by 2 percent .
<user1> When I say your prices are much too high , I don ' t mean they are higher merely by 2 or 3 percent .
<user0> How much do you mean then ? Can you give me a rough idea ?
<user1> To have this business concluded , I should say a reduction of least 10 percent would help .
<user0> Impossible . How can you expect us to make a reduction to that extent ?
<user1> I think you are as well - informed as I am about the market for chemical fertilizers . It ' s unnecessary for me to point out that sup - ply exceeds demand at present and that this situation is apt to continue for a long time yet . May I suggest that you call your home office and see what they have to say ?
<user0> Very well , I will .
<user1> Oh , Thank you . I'm looking for the train station .
<user0> Right . Let me see . You go straight down here and turn right .
<user1> Right ? OK , got it .
<user0> Then take the next left then the next right . Are you with me ?
<user1> Next left then right ? OK .
<user1> I said , ' Do you want me to help you ? '
<user0> I'm trying to find a post office .
<user1> Go three blocks and turn right . It's right there .
<user0> Should I take the bus ?
<user1> No . It'll only take about five minutes to walk .
<user0> Thank you very much .
<user1> Anytime .
<user1> Right . Then you may think that I am not fit for this job according to my educational background .
<user0> Yes .
<user1> But I want to be a tour guide very much because I like traveling and meeting various kinds of people . So I took an evening course at the Tourism School of Beijing after graduation and I have gotten a qualification certificate .
<user0> So you must be an extravert ?
<user1> Yes , I always enjoy being with a group of people and chatting with them .
<user0> What do you think are the responsibilities of a tourist guide ?
<user1> A tourist guide must be responsible for arranging and coordinating tour activities , and offering service of transportation , accommodation , sightseeing , shopping and entertainment .
<user0> Don't you consider it a hard work ?
<user1> Hard but interesting , I think .
<user0> Have you any experience as a tourist guide ?
<user1> Yes , I usually guided foreign tourists around Beijing when I was in University .
<user0> Have you ever learned any other foreign languages other than English ?
<user1> Yes , I have learned a little French and Japanese as well .
<user1> Sorry , I don ' t know the rule about punching .
<user0> That ' s ok . I should have told you earlier . This is a company rule .
<user1> Do we also need to punch out after work ?
<user0> According to the company rule , we should punch in before 8 o ' clock and punch out after 5 o ' clock every work day .
<user1> How about the lunch break , Lucy ?
<user0> From 11 thirty to 1 o ' clock .
<user1> May I ask whether we need to work overtime ?
<user0> Sometimes , but not quite often .
<user1> Let me see . We ' ll try , but I ' m not sure that we can remove it .
<user0> Ok , then . We ' ll I ' d also like to have this pressed .
<user1> Any starch ?
<user0> No starch .
<user1> I have a laceration on my left forearm .
<user0> Let me have a look . How did this happen ?
<user1> I got hit by a car in an accident .
<user0> Was there much bleeding afterward ?
<user1> No , not much .
<user0> Well , this doesn't look too serious . Nurse , could you please get me a suture set ?
<user1> Will I need stitches ?
<user0> Yes . Three , I think . It wont ' be too painful . Alright , we're done . That wasn't so bad , was it ?
<user1> No , not really .
<user0> You're lucky there was no lasting damage . I'll set up an appointment for you to come back in five days . We'll take those stitches out then . So long .
<user1> Thank you , doctor . Bye .
<user1> Ten to nine .
<user0> Your watch is ten minutes slow . So it's should be nine sharp . I'm gonna be late again . What will be my excuse this time ? It should be set the alarm for seven thirty .
<user1> Don't cry over spilled milk , Fred ? Could you stay with me a few minutes ?
<user0> What ? Why ? What's wrong with you ?
<user1> I just hate being alone at home with nothing to do about listen to the clock ticking.It ' s so lonely and boring . My sickness makes it worse . When will I recover ?
<user0> You will be fine in the couple of month , just be patient . I've got to woke now , I'll be late .
<user1> You only care about your work .
<user0> Sorry , baby , you are everything to me . all I do just for our family .
<user1> Stay just a few minutes longer , OK ?
<user0> OK , I'll leave at 9:15 , Is that all right ?
<user1> Yes .
<user0> I'll spent more time with you in the future , Dina .
<user1> Thank you .
<user1> I'd like to reserve a double room . I will be arriving next Monday , the 12th . My name is Wilson .
<user0> A double room for the 12th ? The name is Wilson ?
<user1> Yes , that's right .
<user0> How long will you be staying ?
<user1> Three or four days , perhaps longer .
<user0> Very good , sir . We will be expecting you next Monday , the 12th .
<user1> When it comes to that , I have a lot to say .
<user0> Then say it .
<user1> When I went back to my doctor to hear the results of my lab tests , I tried to keep a poker face even though I was scared to death . Then you guess what he said .
<user0> That ' s just what I want to know .
<user1> He told me the tests were negative and there was nothing wrong with me .
<user1> OK . There are five people in my family , Father , mother , elder brother , younger sister and I .
<user0> Are your brother and sister still in school ?
<user1> My brother has found his job and my sister is still in college .
<user0> What does your father do ?
<user1> My father is a middle school teacher .
<user0> What about your mother ?
<user1> My mother is a housewife .
<user0> Are you married ?
<user1> I am not married yet and I live alone now .
<user0> Do you need to support your family ?
<user1> No , my father and brother are doing that .
<user0> Have you finished school ?
<user1> Yes , I have already graduated .
<user1> I love them , too . Let's move into the kitchen . Wait until you see the refrigerator .
<user0> This is too good to be true .
<user1> And the stove is brand new . You know how to use a gas stove , right ?
<user0> Yes . We've lived in Taiwan for a while . I had a gas stove in the States , too .
<user1> It's better for cooking Chinese food . Well , what do you think ?
<user0> We love it . But we'd like to know about the neighbors .
<user1> Perfect ! Couldn't be better .
<user0> You made a good choice , then ?
<user1> It's just what I want .
<user0> No regrets ?
<user1> I am really pleased with it .
<user0> I am glad you are happy .
<user1> It's super .
<user1> Yes , that's exactly what I need . How about terms for these ?
<user0> Well , we offer 60 - day or 90 - day loans . The balance of the loan is to be repaid in full by the end of the specified period .
<user1> Is there any flexibility on that ?
<user0> Unfortunately , not .
<user1> OK . In my position , I think the best way to go would be for the 90 - day loan . That would give us a little more time to sort out the repayment plan .
<user0> Not a problem , Sir . If you'd just fill out these forms , and of course with necessary clearance , we can get you the money right away .
<user1> All right . Please read it to me .
<user0> On Friday morning , Mr . Wang , the director of Shanghai Research Institute , will visit you at the hotel . In the afternoon , you will discuss some problems with Mr . Yang , vice manager of computer corporation .
<user1> Very good .
<user0> On Saturday , you'll leave the hotel for sightseeing . Miss Lu will be your guide .
<user1> Oh , that's great .
<user1> Sure , do you have the receipt ?
<user0> Yeah here you go . Actually I also want to return this keyboard .
<user1> Ok . may I ask what is the reason for returning these products ?
<user0> The TV flickers a lot when I am watching a movie and at times the image is not very clear .
<user1> I see , and what about the keyboard ?
<user0> I spilled some coffee on it and now it won't work .
<user1> I am sorry mam , but we can only exchange or refund defective products , we cannot take responsibility for misuse or damages .
<user0> Fine ! I don't know why they make these things so delicate anyways .
<user1> Luckily we got the last two .
<user0> Look , Danny . The Four Great Inventions !
<user1> Gunpowder , compass , the paper making , and the printing .
<user0> I really admire those who made such great inventions !
<user1> May , I don't see why they are great . They are just simple things .
<user0> They look simple today . But they were milestones in their times .
<user1> Milestones ? May , you must be kidding .
<user0> Just think Bill Gates , those inventions are as important as the windows system .
<user1> Well , I suppose the ancient inventors made a lot of money out of them .
<user0> No , quite the contrary .
<user1> Why ? Didn't you say that they were milestones ?
<user0> Yes , but they went to the public without any patent protection .
<user1> Well , their inventors were not as clever as Bill Gates .
<user1> I need some medicine .
<user0> For whom ?
<user1> My wife . She suffers from a bad cold .
<user0> What symptoms does she have ?
<user1> Fever and a bad cough .
<user0> I see . Don't worry , just a common cold .
<user1> What kind of medicine does she need ?
<user0> Patulin will be enough .
<user1> How many pills for each time ?
<user0> Nine pills per day , and three pills after each meal .
<user1> Thank you very much .
<user0> It's my pleasure .
<user1> Not at all . I ' m an agnostic . do you ?
<user0> I ' m not sure . Why don ' t you believe there is a god ?
<user1> I think everything has a scientific explanation rather than a theological one .
<user0> I basically believe in science over theology . I mean , I believe in evolution for example . However , there are many things that science hasn ' t explained yet .
<user1> I ' m sure that science will explain everything eventually . I think that the strangest thing about religion is that so many religions people act in ways that their religion claims are wrong .
<user0> For example ?
<user1> Religions preach tolerance , but many wars are caused by intolerant religious fanatics .
<user0> Yes . Such people don ' t appear to be acting in accordance with their religious beliefs .
<user1> They're going skiing in Colorado .
<user0> What a coincidence ! These pajamas would be perfect to take along on the honeymoon !
<user1> You're probably right . Oh , what the heck ! I'll take it all ... in maroon , like you said .
<user1> I'm sick of it , too .
<user0> The door bell doesn't work , there's no hot water , and the building is falling apart .
<user1> It's no use complaining . If we had got enough money , we couldn't put up with it , and would have moved out .
<user0> Sure .
<user1> Is that Sue ?
<user0> Speaking .
<user1> A.This is George .
<user0> Hello , George.What ' s up ?
<user1> Yes , I once booked there . They give the immediate confirm information and flight information to both your mobile phone and e-mail . You can conveniently pay by credit card , so the whole transaction only takes a couple of minutes . They also provide e-tickets , meaning you don ' t need to go to any office to pick an air ticket . You go to the airport directly and check in with your ID card .
<user0> So it has attracted more and more customers these days .
<user1> Yes , therefore they are expanding the scope of their service . For example , hotels can be booked through the same site as well .
<user1> Hello sir , may I help you ?
<user0> Yes . Can I see that T-shirt on the top shelf please ?
<user1> Sure . Here it is .
<user0> How much does it cost ?
<user1> 50 dollars .
<user0> 50 dollars . That's too much .
<user1> How about this one ? It's on sale for only 35 dollars .
<user0> I don't like that one .
<user1> How about the one next to the black gloves ? It's very similar to the one you like .
<user0> That's nice . How much is it ?
<user1> 30 dollars .
<user0> That'll be fine .
<user1> Is this color OK , or would you like a different color ?
<user0> That blue one's fine .
<user1> Do you need any more of these shirts ?
<user0> Yes .
<user1> How many do you want ?
<user0> I'll take two more , a red one and a white one .
<user1> Hi , I am Liu Ming . I am calling to tell you that I have got the job .
<user0> Oh , that is wonderful . Congratulations !
<user1> I really feel grateful to you for your reference . They have mentioned this in the job interview .
<user0> Don't mention it . I think that is because you have right qualifications and nice personality .
<user1> Thanks again . I will start on next Monday . I am sure I will have good performance .
<user0> I agree .
<user1> It's a big bedroom with a drawing room , facing a beautiful wood .
<user0> Is there a bathroom ?
<user1> No , but there is one downstairs , which my daughter used some years ago .
<user0> It sounds good . Could I go and see it myself ?
<user1> Certainly , you're welcome anytime .
<user0> See you later !
<user1> ( after a while ) Good afternoon , Mrs . Smith . I called you just now .
<user0> Welcome ! Come in , please !
<user1> Yes .
<user0> This way please . Your room is upstairs ... Here it is .
<user1> Wonderful ! A modest , comfortable room . Ah , a beautiful window , through which I can see a beautiful scene , and hear the birds singing . How nice !
<user0> Yes , if you want to wash something , there is a separate lavatory room outside .
<user1> Excellent ! I like it ! When can I move in ?
<user0> Anytime you like .
<user1> OK .
<user1> This is Mrs Smith . Can I help you ?
<user0> I am calling to say thank you for the interview yesterday .
<user1> You are welcome . I am very impressed by your capability .
<user0> Is there anything I should do ?
<user1> No , nothing . It's thoughtful of you to call me again .
<user0> Thank you . Please call me at any time if you have any questions .
<user1> Ok , I will . Do you have any question ?
<user0> No , thank you . Goodbye .
<user1> Goodbye .
<user1> Hi . I was wondering what kind of fixed asset loans you have ? Do you have Fixed Asset Loans ?
<user0> Yes , we do . You'll go through the acceptance application , then a first review , then an evaluation and examination and finally get approval . Why don't you read through this brochure ? It outlines all of the important aspects of the loan , the terms and conditions , etc .
<user1> That's a good idea , to familiarise myself with it . Then , I'll be back if we decide to go ahead .
<user1> That's what I am going to do .
<user0> If you have any problem , please come to me .
<user1> I surely will . How much is this wood carving ?
<user0> You are an expert on it . That wood carving is very rare . But I'm so sorry . that is not for sell .
<user1> That's OK . Is anything else recommended ?
<user0> Do you have any special request ?
<user1> I'd like to see some traditional arts .
<user0> So that means you are shopping for presents ?
<user1> Yes , I'm just here to pick out some special presents for my foreign friends .
<user0> Actually , I think the paper-cuts is OK , because it is easy to carry and foreign friends are also interested in it . They think that is a miracle .
<user1> Sounds good . I'll take paper-cut .
<user0> I have collected different kinds of paper-cuts all over the country , you can pick the one you like best .
<user1> You collect them yourself ? I think that you are just doing the wholesale .
<user0> As a matter of fact , I open the shop because I'm interested in the arts . I spent lots of time doing research on the folk art of our country .
<user1> Wow , you are the expert on it .
<user1> I'd like to make a person-to-person call to Beijing , China . The number is 2135367 8 , and I want to speak to Mr . Zhang .
<user0> To Mr . Zhang in at 2135-3678 ?
<user1> Yes , that's right .
<user0> May I have your name and telephone number ?
<user1> My name is Luo Gang , and the phone number is 513-3284 .
<user0> Mr . Luo , will you hold the line , please - - - Mr . Luo , there is no Zhang at that number . Will you check the number again , please ?
<user1> What the number I gave you , operator ?
<user0> It's 2135-3678 .
<user1> Oh , I'm sorry . should have been 2135-3668 , not 3678 . I've given you a wrong number .
<user0> Are you sure this time ?
<user1> Yes .
<user0> OK . Let me try again .
<user1> Thank you .
<user1> Yes , there're some samples in our office and you can take some to study it . Besides , you see , in recent years , we've visited a diversity of factory buildings all over the world and we hope that our building is the perfect match of advanced technology and attractiveness .
<user0> That's a good idea . We can improve our technology to meet your special need .
<user1> And please let white color dominate .
<user0> OK ! I've noted it down . And any others ?
<user1> Oh ! I've almost forgot the location was transferred to the A county in the east of the city .
<user0> I'll tell them .
<user1> Well , the most important thing is that our company demand the quality be exactly the same as the sample which you'll take from the office on the third floor .
<user0> Please feel assured that we'll abide by our promise . And we'll do everything we can to ensure delivery .
<user1> Thanks a lot . And I believe I'll have a good time working with you .
<user0> I think so . Bye !
<user1> Bye !
<user1> That's no problem . Let me see ... You still have ten days annual leave left , is that right ?
<user0> Yes . I was wondering if I could take another two weeks off .
<user1> That's long leave . How's your project coming along ?
<user0> The project I'm in charged of now will be done by the end of this week . I'd like to take my leave from next Monday on .
<user1> Well , all right . But you make sure to tie up loose ends before you leave .
<user0> Thank you , Mr.Black . There are no immediate projects coming up at the moment . Mr.Smith will be in charge during my absence . He is taking part in several projects as my assistant and knows how to maintain relationships with our clients .
<user1> Great ! I hope you have a good relaxation and come back refreshed .
<user0> I will . Many thanks , Mr.Black .
<user1> Only a few .
<user0> What's a few ?
<user1> I've gotten six , I think .
<user0> Did you pay your fines ?
<user1> Of course I have .
<user0> How much are the parking tickets ?
<user1> I think they're $ 130 .
<user0> That's expensive .
<user1> I just got a parking ticket .
<user0> You should probably pay the fine soon .
<user1> I'm going to pay it today .
<user1> I am typing a report for the moment , Mr . Robbins . Anything I need to do ?
<user0> Will you please cut it for a while and come in here to take a letter ?
<user1> Is it urgent ?
<user0> Yes , this letter can't go into the mail any later than 5 . It's about a contract .
<user1> Ok , I am coming .
<user0> Please take a seat , Diana . Have you got your spare pens and pencils ?
<user1> Yes , I have this time . But If I don't understand a word or a phrase when you are dictating , can I ask you halfway ?
<user0> No , I ' d prefer not . I don't want any interruptions every other minute , but you can ask me at the end of the letter .
<user1> All right . I understand now . Do you think I should leave a margin on every page wide enough for notes and amendments .
<user0> Of course , Diana . You'd better pay attention to the spelling when you type it .
<user1> Certainly I will , Mr . Robbins . By the way , may I use a window envelope ?
<user0> Yes , that's fine . Now when you finish these , I want you to put these cards in alphabetical order , using the last names , and then make a list .
<user1> You want the cards in alphabetical order using the last names ?
<user0> Right . And the last thing , we are going to clean the files out tomorrow . Now let's begin .
<user1> I got stuck in traffic again . There was a terrible traffic jam near the Carrefour intersection .
<user0> It's always rather congested down there during rush hour . Maybe you should try to find a different route to get home .
<user1> I don't think it can be avoided , to be honest .
<user0> perhaps it would be better if you started taking public transport system to work .
<user1> I think it's something that I'll have to consider . The public transport system is pretty good .
<user0> It would be better for the environment , too .
<user1> I know . I feel bad about how much my car is adding to the pollution problem in this city .
<user0> Taking the subway would be a lot less stressful than driving as well .
<user1> The only problem is that I'm going to really miss having the freedom that you have with a car .
<user0> Well , when it's nicer outside , you can start biking to work . That will give you just as much freedom as your car usually provides .
<user1> That's true . I could certainly use the exercise !
<user0> So , are you going to quit driving to work then ?
<user1> Yes , it's not good for me or for the environment .
<user1> I can take two thousand off . That'll make the rent twenty-eight thousand .
<user0> That's great . Every little bit counts . And we don't need the parking space . I guess we could rent it out .
<user1> Sure , for at least three thousand per month .
<user0> That'll bring the price down to twenty-five . That's the price we were shooting for .
<user1> I'm glad . Now , there's a deposit fee of two month's rent .
<user1> They'll be ready by this afternoon .
<user0> Oh , no ! I'm leaving for Japan at 11 this morning .
<user1> Is that right ? We're very sorry .
<user0> I thought it was " the same day " service.Anyway , please do hurry .
<user1> I'm afraid we can't return it by 11 o'clock .
<user0> Well , then , would you send it to Japan , please ?
<user1> Yes , we'll do so .
<user1> I want to effect payment under an L / C today .
<user0> No problem . OK ... just checking for you . Ah , I'm afraid there aren't enough funds in your account to cover this transaction . What you can do is buy some US dollars , using local currency and we can credit your account with that amount .
<user1> That seems alright . What's the exchange rate like today ? Good or bad ?
<user0> It's not too bad today , actually . 828.23 .
<user1> I am here to have a discussion on your company's investment issue .
<user0> Sorry , could you tell me your name ?
<user1> I am James Pond from FAM Company and I am here to discuss it with Nova .
<user0> Do you have an appointment ?
<user1> Yes , I did it yesterday . Our meeting should be 2 pm .
<user0> I guess she forgot your meeting . She is attending an important meeting in the company . Will you have a seat ? May I leave a memo for her ?
<user1> Thank you .
<user0> She will be back soon .
<user1> Sure . May I take your measurements ?
<user0> Please don't make it too tight . This is for autumn wear , so make sure you allow for a cardigan underneath .
<user1> I see , sir . Can you come back for a fitting on the 10th , that's in a week's time ?
<user0> The 10th ? I'm sorry , but you see I'm going to attend an international conference on the 11th . Could you have the suit ready by the 8th , or at the latest , the 9th ?
<user1> Well , a business suit usually takes ten days ' time . But in your case , we'll try to have it ready sooner . How about coming for your fitting on the 8th ? Then your suit will be ready for you on the 10th ?
<user0> That's fine , thank you .
<user1> We're here today to present to you the results of our marketing research regarding the consumer behavior .
<user0> I would like to begin by introducing our foreign guests to our stuff on your left ( right ) , we have Mr . Brown , who is Vice President of Sales . Next to him is Ms . Arts , Director of Marketing for the Atlas Company . In the back row is Dr . Barolo , who is visiting from Italy . Thank you all for coming .
<user1> I am glad to see everyone is here and on time . Let's get started ! Susan , toss out some of your ideas .
<user1> Break it up ! I will not permit fighting in this campus .
<user1> exhaust fumes from vehicles cause a great deal of damage to the environment .
<user0> on top of that , there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs , which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city .
<user1> as much as I love this city , I think I'm going to have to find a greener city to live in . Living in a polluted city like this just can't be good for my health .
<user0> I know what you mean . However , there are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming . If it's not the pollution , then it's the natural disasters , deforestation , or the greenhouse
<user1> what is the greenhouse effect exactly ?
<user0> it's the gradual rise in the earth's temperature .
<user1> I see , so it's similar to global warming ?
<user0> they're related to one another , yes .
<user1> I heard that some people in England are pleased with the fact that the climate is becoming warmer because it's making their towns a more pleasant place to live .
<user0> people joke about the benefits of the increase in temperature , but it's not all good news . They've been experiencing a lot of deadly storms there as well .
<user1> people always seem to make jokes as a way to deal with unfortunate situations .
<user0> I think if everyone pitches in , the world will be a better place .
<user1> Thank you . Yes , I would .
<user0> These are chocolate , and those are almond-flavored .
<user1> I guess I'll try a chocolate one first.Mmmm ... this is delicious.Are they hard to make ?
<user0> No , they're really quite easy . Wait a minute , I've got the recipe right here.See ... these are the ingredients , and then you just follow the directions .
<user1> That does look easy . I think I'll make some tonight .
<user1> I'd like to buy a ticket to Casablanca on flight US125 tomorrow .
<user0> Hold on , plese.It will take off at 14:00 tomorrow.The price is $ 110 .
<user1> Well , I want to stay under $ 100 .
<user0> I am sorry Sir . We won't give any discount in busy seasons.The price is the same .
<user1> It ' s easy grandpa . Insert you card into the machine here . Then wait a moment . Ok . Now you enter your PIN . It should have four numbers .
<user0> Oh yes . I ' Ve got it written down here . Just a minute .
<user1> You really shouldn ' t write it down . You should memorise it . You can change it to a more convenient number if you like .
<user0> Ok , I ' Ve entered my PIN . There are several options on the screen . I guess I just choose which service I want , don ' t I ?
<user1> Yes . Choose the service you need to use . If you choose to withdraw money , the machine will ask you how much you want .
<user0> I can just enter the amount using the key , right ?
<user1> That ' s right . Give the machine a moment to process you request . Then take your money .
<user0> These machines aren ' t very difficult to use . In fact , I quite like them . They are much faster than dealing with a band clerk .
<user1> I am sorry , you have the wrong number .
<user0> Oh , I am really sorry .
<user1> Sure . Should I wash or dry ?
<user0> I wash and you'll dry .
<user1> OK . Let's do it .
<user1> Yes , this week's issue just came in . Here it is .
<user0> How about Music Madness ?
<user1> Let me check ... yes , we got the October issue a few days ago . It's on that shelf over there .
<user0> Okay , I'll take these two magazines and a copy of Today's Post .
<user1> Could you tell me my account balance ? My account number is ...
<user0> Just a moment , please . Your name ?
<user1> Emily Smith .
<user0> Here is your balance .
<user1> Thank you . I want to make a withdrawal of 150 dollars .
<user0> Here you go , Miss .
<user1> Thank you .
<user1> How long will you stay there ?
<user0> About one week .
<user1> Where will you live during the vacation .
<user0> In the hotel .
<user1> Have you made a reservation ?
<user0> Yes , we have .
<user1> That's OK .
<user1> Well , I go jogging every morning , eat a healthful diet and work out in a gymnasium twice a week .
<user0> Wow , it sounds like a lot of work . I guess I'm too lazy to do all that .
<user1> Yes , I need to talk to him .
<user0> I'll put the call through then .
<user1> Thank you .
<user1> Yes , madam , how much would you like to remit ?
<user0> 2,000 AD $ .
<user1> Which would you like to remit , by mail or by cable ?
<user0> What is the difference between them ?
<user1> The cable will take less time for your account , in the meantime , the regular service charge is also higher than that of the mail one .
<user0> Well , I think the cable is better .
<user1> OK , please fill in the application form giving the name and address of beneficiary , your name and telephone .
<user0> All right . Here you are .
<user1> Everything is OK . The commission is 50 yuan .
<user0> Here you are . Thanks a lot .
<user1> Why ?
<user0> This channel has so many advertisements , and it doesn't have any good TV programs .
<user1> OK . You can change it .
<user0> What about this one ? Do you like this program ?
<user1> No , I think it is very boring . Can you change it to Channel Twelve , please ?
<user0> Yes . Oh , it's a talk show .
<user1> Yeah , it's very funny . Have you ever watched it before ?
<user0> No , I haven't . This is my first time to watch it .
<user1> I'm sure you will like it .
<user1> As far as I know , the nearest one is next to the Willdon .
<user0> It doesn't matter . I just want to have a relax and I don't care how far it is . Can you tell me how to get there ?
<user1> Yes , take the greyhound bus . It will lead you directly there .
<user0> Thanks a billion .
<user1> How can we relate tiger to this spot , Miss Zhang ?
<user0> Its name originates from a legend that two tigers run here and made a hole , and then a spring gushed out from it .
<user1> How ignorant I am !
<user0> The Longing Tea and the Tiger-running Spring water are always considered as the “ Two Wonders in West Lake . ”
<user1> I know that tea . It smells fragrant .
<user0> That's right . All my guests , attention please . We will have half an hour to visit the spring and take photos . And next spot will be the Moon Reflected in Three Pools .
<user1> Janice , David , come here . We take some photos here . I can't imagine how beautiful it is !
<user1> Thanks .
<user1> No problem . Wait a moment .
<user1> I ' m afraid he's not in .
<user0> Will you ask him to call me collect when he ' s back ?
<user1> Certainly . May I ask who ' s calling , please ?
<user0> Yes , this is Cindy Wang of A & B Trading Company in New York .
<user1> I'm not sure I can't agree , dan
<user0> Why not ?
<user1> Surely , there are other ways to save money .
<user0> What are you talking about , we tried everything !
<user1> Did you get the position you wanted ?
<user0> Yes , I'll be promoted to department manager .
<user1> I'm glad to hear that . Congratulations !
<user0> Thank you . Actually , I could not believe it at first . You know , there're so many outstanding people in our company . Many of them are qualified to fill that position .
<user1> Sure , but you really did great and outperformed the others . You deserved it !
<user0> Thank you very much .
<user1> It was nice to have you with us .
<user0> Thank you for the picnic too . It was supper .
<user1> Not at all . It was a pleasure . Perhaps you will come out with us again while you are here .
<user0> Yes , I'd love to . Thanks again . Goodbye .
<user1> Goodbye .
<user1> Good morning . I bought this vacuum here a few months ago . It doesn ' t work now . Can I return it or get it fixed ?
<user0> Do you have your receipt with you ?
<user1> Yes , I do .
<user0> When did you buy it from our store ?
<user1> Four months ago .
<user0> I ' m sorry . You can ' t return it because too much time has passed since you purchased it . In order to receive a refund , you must return merchandise to the store within 90 days of purchase .
<user1> But the direction book says I will get one-year warranty .
<user0> Yes , I know . After 90 days , you need to call the company that manufactured the vacuum to fix it because it ' s still under their warranty . Their phone number should be in the direction book that came with your vacuum .
<user1> Okay . I understand . I ' ll call the Customer Service Office of the manufacturer . Thank you .
<user0> You ' re welcome .
<user1> Let's see . If we have it , it should be over there under M . ( He looks through the Cds . ) Hmm , it looks like we've sold out of that one , but we should be getting some more copies in soon . If you want , we can order it for you .
<user0> That's okay , I'll just check back later . Do you have the new Sting album ?
<user1> Yes , it's right over here .
<user0> Great . One last question . Where is your jazz section ?
<user1> Back there against that wall .
<user0> Oh , I see it . Thanks for your help .
<user1> No problem .
<user1> Of course , sir . Did you have anything from the minibar ?
<user0> No .
<user1> Ok , the total would be $ 367 and 65 cents.How would you pay ?
<user0> By American express , if that's ok .
<user1> Of course , sir . Will you need taxi ?
<user0> That's ok . I'm expecting a lift from my friend .
<user1> I am a graduate of a technical university and have been employed as a technician with Company or approximately 10 years .
<user0> Please explain why you are interested in leaving your current position and please elaborate on your technical skills .
<user1> I am looking for a growth opportunity , which I feel is not available at my current employer . In terms of skills , I am Microsoft certified in Windows XP and several other operating system
<user0> Where do you see yourself five years from now ?
<user1> I see myself in a management position .
<user1> Yes , do you have sweaters ?
<user0> This way , please . How do you like this one ? It's made of cotton .
<user1> You have quite a range , haven't you ? I would like to see some other styles .
<user1> Again ?
<user0> That's right , even though I did set the alarm last night .
<user1> Your clock never works . Perhaps you should buy a new one .
<user0> Well , if it breaks down again tomorrow , I'll definitely buy a new one .
<user1> Thanks , Denise . Actually , I was really surprised . I mean , there were a lot of qualified people out there .
<user0> Sure . But the work you did was really exceptional ! You definitely deserved it !
<user1> Thanks a lot . I expect to see your name nominated pretty soon , too . You ' Ve been doing some great work !
<user1> They ' re in the cabinet next to the sink .
<user0> Where do you keep the dishes , Baker ?
<user1> They ' re in the cabinet above the dishwasher .
<user0> And the forks and spoons ?
<user1> They ' re in that drawer .
<user0> OK , I know . Would you please help me clean the kitchen ?
<user1> No problem .
<user1> Yes , Todd , how nice to hear your voice !
<user0> Linda , I just wanted to say that I had a wonderful evening with you last Friday .
<user1> I really enjoyed our evening together , Todd .
<user0> I had fun also and was wondering if you would like to go hiking with me in the mountains on Saturday .
<user1> Hiking would be perfect ! May I bring along a picnic lunch for us to share ?
<user0> A picnic lunch would be a nice thing to have along .
<user1> I'll work on the lunch , and you can work out the details of where we will go . What time will you be at my house ?
<user0> Nine would be good , don't you think ?
<user1> Nine is good . See you on Saturday !
<user1> I need some stamps for this letter .
<user0> What kind of stamps do you want ?
<user1> How much do I need for this letter ?
<user0> I must weigh it first . Err ... It's five grams over weigh , Do you want to send it as an ordinary or registered letter ?
<user1> I want it registered . How much is it then ?
<user0> Registration plus overnight ... err ... seven dollars in all .
<user1> Here's a 10 - dollar bill .
<user0> Now , your receipt , and the change .
<user1> Thanks . Good-bye .
<user1> OK . What ?
<user0> It isn't gratitude . It's fear . Vince is afraid I'll jump to a competitor .
<user1> You wouldn't do that . Would you ?
<user0> I might . Vince knows he needs to keep me happy .
<user1> What about your accounts ?
<user1> Yes , I am wondering if I can join the sightseeing tour in your hotel .
<user0> Of course . How many people are there in your party ?
<user1> 4 persons altogether .
<user0> OK , I will arrange it for you .
<user1> Thank you . Put the charge on my bills , please .
<user1> Yes , madam . May I help you ?
<user0> Yes . I ' m calling from Westwood and Westwood Attorneys . I need to make a reservation for Mr . Alex Brent .
<user1> Fine , madam . When will Mr . Brent be arriving , and how many nights will he be staying ?
<user1> it's beautiful . Enjoy it while it lasts . It's supposed to get cold tomorrow .
<user0> what's the weather forecast for tomorrow ?
<user1> it's supposed to snow early tomorrow morning and then tomorrow afternoon there's a chance of freezing rain .
<user0> that doesn't sound pretty .
<user1> do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
<user0> well , I was going to drive to Birmingham to see some friends .
<user1> you might want to change your plans . With the cold and wet weather that we're supposed to have tomorrow , the roads are going to be rather slippery .
<user0> I suppose I should . I don't like driving in dangerous weather conditions . Do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
<user1> I just have to go to class tomorrow afternoon .
<user0> if you're lucky , it'll get cancelled and you can have a snow day !
<user1> if that happens , then I'll invite you over and we can drink hot cocoa and watch movies .
<user0> that sounds like fun .
<user1> hey , look outside ! It's started to drizzle !
<user0> English weather is even more predictable than I had previously thought .
<user1> Certainly . The product has a two-year guarantee . If it breaks down during that period we offer a replacement unit completely free of charge . Our products are very reliable but we recommend you take out an extended warranty . This covers you for a further two years .
<user0> I see . What does that include ?
<user1> It covers all parts and labour , except for normal wear and tear of course .
<user0> What sort of response time do you guarantee ?
<user1> Our engineers are on call 24 hours a day . We guarantee someone will be with you within four hours , but in practice it's often much sooner .
<user0> Are there any exclusions ?
<user1> Not really . It's a very comprehensive warranty . I ' ll put a copy in the post to you and you can read through the small print .
<user1> No , nothing in particular .
<user0> All right . If we decide to hire you , we'd pay you two thousand and five hundred yuan a month at the start . You can have Saturdays and Sundays off . Besides , you may have a paid month holiday every year . How do you think about it ?
<user1> As regards salary , I leave it to you to decide after experience of capacity .
<user0> Well , we'll give you our decision in a couple of days . It's a pleasure to talk to you , Mr . Liu .
<user1> Thank you , Mr . White . I really appreciate your assistance .
<user1> Yes , several times .
<user0> How do you like them ?
<user1> Not bad .
<user0> I always have the temptation to eat something there .
<user1> Then , why didn't you do that ?
<user0> I don't know how much we can trust them . Do you have any ideas ?
<user1> Some of them , I think , are not good .
<user0> It doesn't taste good ?
<user1> No , I mean some of them are not clean enough .
<user0> That's my greatest concern . But how can you tell which one is clean ?
<user1> I judge by appearances .
<user0> I got it . I think it's worth trying .
<user1> It certainly is .
<user0> I'd like to try some kebab , roasted squid , and many different appealing things .
<user1> Don't try everything at one time , please .
<user0> I see . Thank you .
<user1> Everything is gone , sir ?
<user0> There's not a drop left of anything .
<user1> Is there anything in particular you want ?
<user0> Yes , the Perrier and the Jim Beam hit the spot . Let me have three more of each .
<user1> Got it . Anything else ?
<user0> I really liked the apples . Bring me a couple of apples , please .
<user1> Not a problem . Anything else ?
<user0> Oh , yes , one more thing
<user1> Someone will be up shortly with your order , sir .
<user1> I don't think you can . In China , our currency is not freely convertible yet .
<user0> Do you mean there is no way to get any foreign money ?
<user1> No . You can go to the Bank of China to exchange some US dollars at the current exchange rate of the day you exchange them . The maximum amount you can exchange is $ 2,000 .
<user0> Only $ 2,000 ? Are there any other ways to get the money exchanged ?
<user1> The only official way is to go to Bank of China .
<user0> I'd better take more dollars with me . It seems that I need to borrow some from my friends .
<user1> That ' s a big order , Jane . I am really swamped .
<user0> I know what you ' re saying , but I have to go over the books with you before I go see our tax guy .
<user1> Right . Okay , let me see what I can do . How about 1:30 right after my lunch meeting ? It won ' t take more than a half hour , will it ?
<user1> It ' s because of my son . Dick keeps getting on my nerves
<user0> Dick ? How come ? He used to be as meek as a lamb .
<user1> Yes , he used to be . But now he ' s drifting off track .
<user0> He must have been in bad company , or he wouldn ' t be off the beans .
<user1> Would you like butter or jam on your toast or do you just want it plain ?
<user0> Spread some jam , please .
<user1> Anything to drink ?
<user0> Black coffee is fine .
<user1> Ten more minutes , mom .

<user1> I brought Strawberry Sticks . See ?
<user0> Those are the ones that are pre-dipped in sweet coating !
<user1> Yep . And there's real strawberry chunks in the coating .
<user1> Is that right ? This is a brand new outfit .

<user1> I went to Macy's and picked it out .

<user1> I think that those are some really nice shoes . What kind are they ?
<user0> These are Chucks .
<user1> Your shoes look really nice . How much did you get them for ?
<user0> They only cost me about forty dollars .
<user1> I'm going to go get a pair for myself .
<user1> I'd like to be waken up tomorrow morning .
<user0> OK sir . At what time ?
<user1> Well , how long is it from here to the train station ?
<user0> If you take a taxi , it will be 20 minutes .
<user1> Then please wake me up at 7 : OO.Thank you .
<user1> All right , Bill.Here ' s your daily exercise schedule . You are to jog before breakfast .

<user1> Use the stairs , never the elevator .
<user0> Oh , dear .
<user1> And three times a week , you can either swim , play racketball , or hand ball .
<user0> Oh no .
<user1> OK , you can stop now.It ' s time for the dance class .
<user0> Dance class ! I don't know how .
<user1> You will .

<user0> Yes , I do . Do you accept American Express ?
<user1> Sorry , sir , just VISA or MasterCard .
<user0> Okay . Here's my VISA card .
<user1> Okay . You're in room 507 . It's a single queen-size bed , spacious , and nonsmoking . Is that suitable ?
<user0> Yes , it sounds like everything I expected .
<user1> Here's your key , sir . If you need anything , just dial 0 on your room phone .
<user1> Sure , what do you want me to tell them ?
<user0> Well , I need to confirm the time of their classes .
<user1> Ok , where can I find their telephone number ?
<user0> They are all listed here on this sheet of paper .
<user1> Is it their home , office or cell phone numbers ?
<user0> Unless it ' s marked differently , it ' s their home numbers .
<user1> Alright . What if I can ' t get a hold of them by phone ?
<user0> Then , you should e-mail them with the information .
<user1> Where can I find their e-mail addresses ?
<user0> They should have then listed on their resumes .
<user1> And if there aren ' t any e-mail addresses ?
<user0> Then send them a SMS on their cell phone .
<user1> Ok . That sounds easy enough . Have you called any of them yet ?
<user0> Yes . I called the first three people on the list , but they didn ' t pick up .
<user1> Did you leave a voice message ?
<user0> I left a voice message on one---just for the first person on the list .
<user1> I see . What did you tell her ?
<user0> I told her that she should call me back at my office number .
<user1> Ok , so , maybe I should call her again .
<user0> Yes , that sounds like a good idea . She might not get the other message in time .
<user1> One more question . It looks like some of these numbers are long-distance . Do you have a calling card that I can use to get through to them ?
<user0> Sure . You can use this one . The pin number is written on the back of the card .
<user1> Alright . Thanks a lot . Don ' t worry . I ' ll take care of it .
<user0> Great work . I ' m off for the weekend ! See you on Monday .
<user1> See you .
<user1> It is 15 minutes ' drive .
<user0> What companies do we have in our neighborhood ?
<user1> Mitsubishi , HP , IBM and many other famous corporations .
<user0> Does the 7th floor belong to our company too ?
<user1> Yes , our company has two floors , the 6th and 7th floor in this building .
<user0> It ' s such a large firm . Do we have our own staff restaurant ?
<user1> Yes , at the end of the hall .
<user1> I know . Sorry , I shouldn't have rushed you , but I just couldn't stay at home and wait .
<user0> Never mind . What about taking a look around the theater ?
<user1> Why not ? I'd love to do that .
<user0> Here we go . There is a museum of the Beijing Opera art .
<user1> Wow . Look at this . So delicate and beautiful . Did ancient Chinese people really wear them ?
<user0> Not really . They are just opera costumes . Do you like the embroidery ?
<user1> I surely do . They must have had advanced machine in ancient China to do that .
<user0> No , no , no . They are all handmade , girl . You know , the ancient Chinese women were supposed to be good at needlework .
<user1> Unbelievable ! I could never do that .
<user1> Well . Have you got his permission ?
<user0> Yes . We have an appointment at eight o ' clock .
<user1> What ' s your name , please ?
<user0> Robert . Philips Robert .
<user1> Yes . This gap can be filled by export market research before exporting .
<user0> But the importance of the export research is often neglected by the managers .
<user1> That's right . They do not appreciate its value and consider it to be a luxury .
<user0> Therefore , when enterprises are spending a lot of money in trying to penetrate a new market , they should research whether their products can be sold at high enough a price and in a satisfactory amount .
<user1> Exactly !
<user1> I was wondering if you like team projects , or projects that you work on alone .
<user0> I like to work on group projects that value and need each individual ' s contributions .
<user1> Are you most interested in a good steady job with benefits or one that will allow you to quickly advance ?
<user0> I have children so a steady job is important but I would like a chance to advance .
<user1> How would you feel about relocating to another state ?
<user0> I could not relocate in the next year , but might be open to it in the future .
<user1> Do you know how much this job offers per year ?
<user0> A minimum of 75,000 per year .
<user1> OK , well , that ' s all I need to know for now . If something comes up , we ' ll be contacting you .
<user1> I'm sorry , he's out at the moment .
<user0> When do you expect him back ?
<user1> I think he'll be back in about an hour at least .
<user0> Well , may I leave a message ?
<user1> Yes , of course .
<user0> Would you please ask him to call Chris when he gets back ?
<user1> Ok . Does he know your number ?
<user0> I'm afraid he doesn't . My mobile is 139- 2477 - 4026 .
<user1> 13924774026 . All right . Thanks for calling . Oh , hang on , someone's at the door that may be him , please hold on .
<user1> That ' s all right . Everyone feels under the weather sometimes . Just finish the rest when you feel well .
<user1> Yes , can I help you ?
<user0> Where shall I pay the bill ?
<user1> You can pay here .
<user0> OK . How much is it all together ?
<user1> It is one hundred and fifty . This is your bill .
<user0> Is the service charge included ?
<user1> Yes .
<user0> OK , here you are .
<user1> Thank you .
<user1> Yes , I spent so much time sightseeing here . It is already so late now . I am afraid I can't catch the last bus back to downtown .
<user0> Don't worry . I will try to get a taxi for you . You can take it to the bus station .
<user1> I am very grateful to your help .
<user0> Don't mention it . It is my duty .
<user1> Thanks again .
<user1> Just about .
<user1> Here's some water . Take these multi-vitamins and Tylenol .
<user0> Uh ! I can't swallow them , Mom !
<user1> Your throat must be swollen .
<user0> Do I have to take them ?
<user1> Here , I'll break them up , so they're smaller . And here's some cough syrup .
<user0> Yuck !
<user1> I know , it tastes horrible . But it'll make you feel better . Try holding your nose . It won't taste as bad .
<user1> Oh , hello , Tom ! Beautiful day , isn ' t it ?
<user0> Yes , it is !
<user1> Yes . Is there anything I can do for you ?
<user0> Could you tell me something about the terms and interest rates for personal automobile consumer loan ?
<user1> The deadline is normally no more than 5 years with the interest adopted according to the corresponding lending rates announced by the PBC .
<user0> I plan to take the loan for 3 years .
<user1> Well , the yearly interest rate is 5.49 % for 3 years . I'm sure you are qualified to apply for this loan .
<user0> What about the loan repayment ?
<user1> You may choose a repayment pattern by consulting with our bank , for example , payment of equal amount of principal or of principal and interest on monthly installments .
<user0> Does that mean I should deposit sufficient money to my account prior to the monthly payment date so that you can directly deduct the repayment of the principal and interest ?
<user1> Exactly . You are permitted to effect and early payment in part or in full with the consent of our bank .
<user0> That's very thoughtful of you . Thank you so much .
<user1> You're welcome .
<user1> That apartment never had any problems before . Are you sure the problem isn ' t you ?
<user0> We spoke with you the first week we moved in about things that you promised to fix .
<user1> Where do you think you have problems ?
<user0> There is no hot water , the bedroom has a broken window , and there are rats in the kitchen .
<user1> You know , no one else who has been in that apartment has had a problem before .
<user0> You are obligated to maintain your building and my apartment .
<user1> I will fix these problems when I get around to it .
<user0> I will be withholding my rent check this Friday unless these problems are addressed immediately .
<user1> You can ' t do that ! It ' s illegal !
<user1> I know and they are really nice , too .
<user0> I ' ll have to get a couple in different colors .
<user1> Me , too .
<user0> Buy them now though , or they might not still be here tomorrow .
<user1> Good idea , especially at this price .
<user1> Yes , sir . Where to ?
<user0> Wangfujing , please !
<user1> All right .
<user0> Oh , I like the music on your radio . It's nice .
<user1> Thank you ! I always tune to this program when driving . So what's your favorite program ?
<user0> I like Winner's English very mush . You know the Beijing Olympic Games is right around the corner . We should learn English Well . It's on FM 96.6 , China Business Radio . You can get it on your radio too .
<user1> But I don't speak English at all .
<user0> That's OK . The program is especially for the beginners like us .
<user1> Really ? When is it on ?
<user0> It begins at 6:40 every morning , and it goes for 20 minutes .
<user1> Thank you so much . I'll try and catch that .
<user0> The radio has brought us lots of convenience .
<user1> Yes , I can also learn about the traffic condition through it .
<user0> With the development of the society and technology , radio is nearly everywhere .
<user1> So we should take the advantage of it .
<user1> Certainly ! The first thing is to be honest about how much time for you can devote to your pet . Dogs are very demanding . You need to take them for walks and they love to play . Cats , on the other hand , are more independent .
<user0> I ' m fairly busy , so I really need an animal that I don ' t need to care of very much . Actually , I ' d like a pet that ' s a little unusual . I don't ' really want a typical pet , like a cat , dog , or hamster . Do you have any suggestions ?
<user1> Unusual pet are often more expensive to keep . Is that a problem ?
<user0> Not really . By the way , I don ' t want a pet that could be dangerous , like a tarantula or rattlesnake .
<user1> We have those , but I only sell them to people I know well , for obvious reasons . How about a lizard ? I have some that are very brightly coloured , are not aggressive , and are easy to feed and look after .
<user0> That sounds ideal . Could you show me some ?
<user1> Sure . Come over here . As you can see , I have a wide selection of species . They can live together , if you want lizards of different kinds . Do you have a favourite colour ?
<user0> I like the red one . What do they eat ?
<user1> You can feed them on various things . They will eat small pieces of meat , but I ' d recommend insects . You can get them from your garden , but remember that lizards eat a lot insects . I sell them here .
<user0> Thanks a lot . What I ' ll do si find out more online and drop by next week .
<user1> That ' s fine . You shouldn ' t make a hasty decision when choosing a pet .
<user1> May I have your flight number , please ?
<user0> World Airlines , Flight 201 .
<user1> And your name , please ?
<user0> John Anderson .
<user1> Yes , sir . You're booked on Flight 201 , leaving in one hour .
<user0> Thank you .
<user1> Sure . Doing your homework and preparing for an interview really pays off .
<user0> I ' Ve researched the company and think I ' m perfect for the job but I ' m not sure how to get it across to them .
<user1> Well first you have to have more confidence.Employers look for people who are interested , enthusiastic and sure of themselves .
<user0> I know I have what it takes but Im worried that my work experience won ' t sufficient . Should I inflate my experience ?
<user1> No , you should always be upfront and honest about your weaknesses . However by focusing on your strong points and maintaining a positive attitude about your abilities , you can take the attention
<user1> You will receive a Notice of Unemployment Insurance Award letter .
<user0> What will that tell me ?
<user1> The Award Letter will tell you how much you will receive weekly .
<user0> Are there any other forms that I need to fill out ?
<user1> You will need to fill out a Continued Claim Form every two weeks .
<user0> What information will I need to provide on that form ?
<user1> They will need to know where you worked and how much money you made .
<user0> Are there any other questions on the form ?
<user1> Basically , they want to know that you were available for work and not sick .
<user1> I am the apartment manager . How can I help you ?

<user1> I will be at the apartment today at 6
<user0> Yes , I can be there at 6 .
<user1> Great . I'll see you at 6 . Do you know where it is ?
<user0> Yes , I have a friend who lives in that neighborhood .
<user1> I'll be bringing an application form .

<user0> On the left of the elevator of the 3rd floor .
<user1> I ' d like to buy a woolen vest for my grandpa .
<user0> I ' m sure you can find your favorite there .
<user1> Thank you very much .
<user0> It ' s my honor .
<user1> Well , I haven't made such arrangements with the factory yet . So I'd like to make sure if it is acceptable to the factory before making a commitment to you .
<user0> All right , but I'm busy . How long will it be before you can finish the talk ?
<user1> I won't be too long , I suppose . Just let me ring them , will you ?
<user0> Go ahead .
<user1> Thank you .

<user1> Yes , you can have it delivered or filled at any location in our HMO .
<user0> When should I take this medication ?
<user1> You need to take it at bedtime .
<user0> Should I take this medicine on an empty stomach ?
<user1> Don ' t mix alcohol with this medication , but you can take it with or without food .
<user0> What are the side effects of this medication ?
<user1> You might feel a little dizzy at first , but it should pass .

<user0> Do you get paid onetime ?
<user1> No , I don ' t . I get a bonus each month , depending on the value of the contracts I sign with clients .
<user0> Do you have any breaks ?
<user1> We have an hour-long lunch break form 12 to 1 . we can take coffee breaks during the day . My boss doesn ' t mind , as long as we get out work done on time .

<user0> Would you able to pick him out of a line-up ?
<user1> That shouldn't be a problem .
<user1> Sure , Johnny , how much do you need ? five bucks ?
<user0> Come on , Dad , I need thirty thousand . I wanna get into the market . You know , I ' m tired of hearing all this news about the economic downturn , the inevitable recession , people stuffing their money in their mattresses . I look at this as an opportunity . This is a chance for me to get a jump start on building my nest egg .
<user1> I don ' t know about that.with all the uncertainty in the markets right now , it would be a very unwise decision to invest . I don ' t know if you ' re aware son , but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently . There have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months , and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the economy . There ' s just too much instability . I wouldn ' t feel comfortable investing in this climate .
<user0> But look at it this way , every challenge is an opportunity.And anyway , I ' m not talking about investing in the domestic market . There are emerging markets that promise great returns . Look at China , for example.they have 1.4 billion people , half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class . Here alone , the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity .
<user1> Come on , son , you ' re looking at this too naively , the Chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability , and their currency has been devalued by almost a whole percentage point .
<user0> Fine , then ! If that ' s the way you feel , so be it . But you ' re losing out on a great opportunity here . I ' m going to go hit up Mum for the cash .
<user1> Well in total we have around 150 employees based in Hong Kong with another 400 in our head office in Beijing . The news desk staff in Hong Kong comprises around 80 staff .
<user0> I see . And how about the working hours ?
<user1> Well , as you know Rebecca , in journalism work hours are not exactly nine to five . You could be on call at any time . We do have to work very unsociable hours at times .
<user0> Well I am used to that , Mr . Parsons , so that ' s not really a shock for me .
<user1> Good , as long as you understand that .
<user0> And when do you need to fill the vacancy , Mr . Parsons ?
<user1> Yesterday ! But no , we are hoping to start from the beginning of next month .
<user0> That sounds ideal .
<user1> Well , since we are getting up so late , I decided to make a big breakfast !
<user0> Nice ! Brunch !
<user1> Kind of , so I made scrambled and soft boiled eggs , some french toast and buttermilk pancakes !
<user0> Wow ! You really went all out ! Did you make any coffee ?
<user1> Yeah , just the way you like it ! I also put out some cereal and muesli if you feel like having something more light .
<user0> Looks good ! I ' ll squeeze us some fresh orange juice .
<user1> Get the jam and butter while you are in there ! Oh ! And don ' t forget the syrup !
<user1> Em , it's delicious !
<user0> Thank you ! My wife likes cooking very much .
<user1> You're lucky .
<user1> I have learned English for 10 years , and I have passed College English Test Band 4 and 6.My spoken English is fairly good enough to express myself fluently .
<user0> What other foreign language do you speak ?
<user1> I did self-study of Japanese in college , and I can carry on some simple conversations in Japanese .
<user1> I learned from your ad.That you will provide on-the-job training for new employees.This is just what I need , because I'm a recent college graduate . I have the necessary knowledge and skills but I lack experience .
<user0> What do you hope to become ?
<user1> I want to prove my true value in the electronic industry , and hopefully in the near future I would be promoted to a higher position .
<user0> Well , thank you for coming.We ' ll let you know as soon as possible .
<user1> No , don't try to tempt me . I'm becoming chubby , and I have to slim down .
<user0> You are not really chubby . You are actually thin enough .
<user1> I don't think so . I know I've put on weight this winter .
<user0> So you are watching your weight , aren't you ?
<user1> Yes , to tell you the truth . I am on a diet .
<user1> I had been doing quite well . In all subjects , I got excellent scores .
<user0> Well . In that case , you must have got good records in English , too .
<user1> Yes , I was the top student among my classmates .
<user0> How about your oral English ?
<user1> Quite well . I took the National English Speaking Contest in CCTV 2008 and I got first place .
<user1> Certainly , sir . What would you like done to them ?
<user0> They're a little bit too long , so I'd like about half an inch taken off them .
<user1> All right , sir . They should be ready for you by tomorrow afternoon .
<user0> Thank you very much .
<user1> It's our pleasure .
<user1> So I am .
<user0> When did you get your passport ?
<user1> I got it last week .
<user0> How long is it valid ?
<user1> It's valid for 5 years . I am planning to do a doctor ' s degree during my stay there .
<user0> Good . Good luck to you !
<user1> Thank you very much .
<user1> It's nice to meet you . Thanks for coming .
<user0> It's my pleasure .
<user1> I wanted to meet with you to discuss your daughter .
<user0> Is she acting up in class ?
<user1> Not at all . She's a joy to have in my class .
<user0> Is she really ?
<user1> She is absolutely wonderful .
<user0> So she isn't causing you any problems ?
<user1> No . She is actually very intelligent and well behaved .
<user0> I'm glad to know that you like her .
<user1> You have nothing to worry about with her .
<user1> Can we have two adjoining double rooms , sir ?
<user0> Have you made a reservation , ladies ?
<user1> I'm afraid not .
<user0> One moment , please . I have to check if there are rooms available . I'm sorry , ladies . We have only two double rooms available but they are on different floors . Would you mind that ?
<user1> We prefer on the same floor because we will probably chat late at night .
<user0> Then may I suggest a family suite ? We have just had a cancellation .
<user1> What is it like ?
<user0> It's a big room with a king-size double bed and two single beds . We could also add rollaways .
<user1> That's great ! How much is it ?
<user0> Two thousand hongkong dollars per night plus ten percent service charge and five percent government government tax .
<user1> That's fine .
<user0> But ladies , the room is not yet ready . There will be a delay of about half an hour . Perhaps you could fill in the registration form first , and then rest in our lobby for a while . We will let you know when the room is ready .
<user1> Alright , hanks .
<user0> Ladies , hotel policy requires one night's room charge as deposit .
<user1> Do you take traveler's checks ?
<user0> Yes , we do , madam . Thank you , madam . Here's our welcome brochure with all the information of our facilities . My name is Johnny . If you need any help at all , do let me know . I'm at your service .
<user1> Yes , please .
<user0> How are you doing , Madam ? My name is During . I am coming to your company for an interview as requested .
<user1> Fine , thank you for coming . Mr . Wu , Please take a seat . I am Anne Smith , the assistant manager .
<user0> Nice to see you , Mrs . Smith .
<user1> Nice to meet you , too .
<user1> Well , right now , we can't afford internet use in the rooms . But you can go to the web bar in our hotel . It's on the 12 floor .
<user0> Thank you . I think I will go there .
<user1> This is he speaking .
<user0> Oh , how do you do , Mr.Zhang ? This is Mary speaking , I have a present for you from Wu of Beijing .
<user1> Oh , thank you .
<user0> Mr.Wu had told me that you were coming to Changchun . May I call on you at your hotel tomorrow ?
<user1> Yes , it's all right . Shall we say two in the afternoon ?
<user0> Great . Then I'll be at your hotel at two .
<user1> All Right .
<user0> How could I get there ?
<user1> The hotel is near to People's Square . Its name is Bai Ju Hotel .
<user0> what's your room number ?
<user1> It's Room 302 on the third floor . But I'll be waiting for you in the lobby , If you can't find me , please page me .
<user0> I'll do that , Mr.Zhang , See you tomorrow .
<user1> See you !
<user1> I come from Greece .
<user0> What's the climate like in your country ?
<user1> It's very pleasant .
<user0> What's the weather like in spring ?
<user1> It's often windy in March . It's always warm in April and May , but it rains sometimes .
<user0> What's it like in summer ?
<user1> It's always hot in June , July and August . The sun shines every day .
<user0> Is it cold or warm in autumn ?
<user1> It's always warm in September and October . It's often cold in November and it rains sometimes .
<user0> Is it very cold in winter ?
<user1> It's often cold in December , January and February . It snows sometimes .
<user1> I went first last time .
<user0> No , Mary went first last time .
<user1> Oh , Okay .
<user1> Turn left at the second light . You can't miss it .
<user0> Will it take me long to get there ?
<user1> No . It's not far at all .
<user0> Thank you very much .
<user1> That's all right . Have a good day .
<user1> Before we discuss the price , may I ask you what kind of exhibits you are interested in ?
<user0> Your summer clothes for white-collar and men's jackets .
<user1> Can you give us a rough idea of the quantity you require ? It is generally known that the price varies according to the quantity .
<user0> That is to say , 10000 sets for the one of white-collar and 5000 for men's jackets .
<user1> In that case , our offer for the white-collar series is US $ 200 , and the other is US $ 300 per set .
<user0> Do you quote CIF or FOB ?
<user1> We usually quote on a CIF basis and a commission of five percent for you . You will find our price is most competitive .
<user0> What are your terms of payment ?
<user1> Letter of credit at sight .
<user0> Another question . Could you tell me the earliest possible time of shipment ?
<user1> Within a month after your letter of credit reaches us .
<user0> Well , I got all the point . All the decision will be made since I get the approval from my supervisor .
<user1> OK ! I expect you to accept our general terms and conditions of trade . We believe that through our cooperation , large transactions will be brought to speedy conclusion .
<user1> Do you have any postcards ?
<user0> Yes , here are what we have exclusively for our guests .
<user1> Can I have one each ?
<user0> Sure . Take as much as you want . They are free gifts from this shop .
<user1> Is there anywhere I can buy some more cards with beautiful scenery ?
<user0> Please try the shop there . They might have them .
<user1> Are their cards free , too ?
<user0> No , their cards are for sale .
<user1> I think it ' s great ! I really like the color , and it goes really well with your eyes . I ' Ve actually been eyeing that dress at Maxine ' s for a while now , but I wasn ' t sure I could afford ninety-five dollars for a dress at the moment .
<user0> Um , ninety-five dollars ?
<user1> Yes , that ' s the price they were advertising it at . I was hoping it might go on sale soon . Why , how much did you pay for it ?
<user0> I bought it for one hundred and forty-five dollars at Helen ' s Boutique . I didn ' t know I could get it cheaper somewhere else .
<user1> Of course ! Everything at Helen ' s is overpriced , and they sell things that you can find at almost every other clothing store ! Why didn ' t you shop around ?
<user0> I don ' t know , I just saw the dress and thought about how pretty it looks and how much I wanted it . I guess I was too impulsive .
<user1> Yes , a very long time .
<user0> What brings you here ?
<user1> I'm here on vacation .
<user1> Yes , I ' m enquiring about your advertisement for a sales manager in today ' s newspaper . Is this position still open ?
<user0> Yes , but do you have any experiences as a sales manager ?
<user1> Yes , I have a lot of previous experiences in sales . I worked in sales departments for two companies since I finished my university .
<user0> That sounds fine . Please give me your name and phone numbers . I ' ll set up an appointment for an interview for you . It will most likely be in a couple of days . Is it all right for you ?
<user1> Yes , my name is Brian and my phone number is 5294870 .
<user0> Thank you .
<user1> Where are you going to find one ?
<user0> I have no idea .
<user1> Do you want to know where I bought mine ?
<user0> Where'd you get it from ?
<user1> I got it from IKEA .
<user0> How much did it cost you ?
<user1> It cost me a couple thousand for the whole set .
<user0> Is the furniture sturdy ?
<user1> The furniture is built extremely well .
<user0> I don't mind paying a lot as long as the quality is good .
<user1> Well , trust me . The quality is fantastic .
<user1> The one with a very big nose .
<user0> I'd like to meet him.Will you introduce him to me ?
<user1> OK .
<user1> You are expected to write the educational experience about your high school and college , even the time span .
<user0> What do you mean by ' job intentions ' ?
<user1> Job intentions refer to the kind of job you are eager to get , for example , accounting , marketing .
<user1> Do you have any seats for September 16th ?
<user0> Let's see ... I'm afraid the 16th is fully booked . But I have seats for the 17th .
<user1> The 17th will be fine .
<user0> And what date will you be returning ?
<user1> Hmm , I guess on the 28th .
<user0> Okay , you ' re booked on American Airlines flight 710 , departing JFK at 6:40 p . m . on September 17th . Your return flight is flight 711 , departing London ' s Heathrow Airport at 11:15 a . m . on September 28th .
<user1> Sounds good . Thanks a lot .
<user1> We would like to book a table for 6 at 7:00 in the evening .
<user0> OK , sir . We will arrange one for you .
<user1> Can we bring drinks by ourselves ?
<user0> Sorry , sir . It's not allowed in our hotel .
<user1> All right . Thank you .
<user1> Yes . I ' d like to make an appointment with Dr . Galas . Could you arrange it for me ?
<user0> Sure . Let me check his schedule . How about tomorrow afternoon at 2:30 ?
<user1> I ' m not available tomorrow afternoon . How about tomorrow morning ?
<user0> I ' m sorry . Dr . Galas is fully engaged tomorrow morning . How about the day after tomorrow at 9:30 in the morning ?
<user1> That ' s fine . Thanks .
<user0> You ' re welcome . Could I have your name and phone number , please ?
<user1> Certainly . My name is Janet Smith , and my phone number is 610-555-1234 .
<user0> Very good , Ms . Smith . I have scheduled an appointment for you on Wednesday at 9:30 am .
<user1> Thank you very much .
<user0> You ' re welcome .
<user1> Very interesting . Thank you for bringing it to us .
<user0> Are you interested in making this investment ?
<user1> We haven't decided yet , we will let you know if we do .
<user1> I was nervous at that time . What about you ?
<user0> Just fine . I tried to answer every question raised by HR carefully . I found some answering skills are useful . These questions are different from exams .
<user1> We can have a rest now after this tough interview .
<user0> Don't be rush . It is suggested to write a letter for the Personnel Department of Future Clothes Company .
<user1> Sounds like a good idea . And I think this can leave deep impression to HR . How can we write a suitable letter ?
<user0> Just to show your gratitude to the chance and tell them your impression on the company . And you can mention some details in your own interview to remind them of you .
<user1> I am getting to know your meaning .
<user1> When you made your appointment , what day did you choose ?
<user0> My appointment was on Wednesday .
<user1> At what time was that appointment ?
<user0> It was for 4
<user1> I can see the appointment that you had . What day do you need to change to ?
<user0> I want to change to next Tuesday .
<user1> What time would you prefer ?
<user0> I would prefer three o ' clock in the afternoon .
<user1> I will put you down for that time . Thank you for calling to reschedule .
<user1> En , I am looking for a porter , do you know where I can find one ?
<user0> There are so many here.The men with red hats are the porters .
<user1> What's the charge ?
<user0> Well , it depends how many pieces of luggages you have .
<user1> Thank you .
<user1> Yes , not bad . Like turn your cell phone ringer off and find a private place to make calls which it ' s showing your respect to your co-workers .
<user0> Well , but for this one , don ' t bring your cell phone to meetings , I think it is not reasonable . What if there are some important calls ?
<user1> Well , this one is not compulsory . It is just suggestion .
<user0> I didn ' t pay attention to that .
<user1> It's a difficult choice.The train is a little faster , but much more expensive .
<user0> We could face delays if we travel by bus , thanks to traffic jams .
<user1> Buses are more cramps and you can't walk around .
<user0> That's true.But I feel that I see more when I travel by bus .
<user1> Really ? I think you see more traveling by train .
<user0> So which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
<user1> I prefer going by train , even though it costs more .
<user0> Ok , then we'll go by train . I'm sure we'll have a good journey.Shall we go to the station and buy the tickets ?
<user1> The trains aren't usually full.We can get them on the day we travel.We should buy return tickets , because they are much cheaper than getting 2 singles .
<user0> We should take a packed lunch on the journey.The food they sell on the trains is always expensive .
<user1> No , what ?
<user0> She and Vic broke up and now she ' s asked for a transfer .
<user1> Get out of here ! I didn ' t even know they were dating !
<user0> No one really did . They were very discreet and professional at the office .
<user1> Well , I'm not too happy about it .
<user0> What's wrong with it ?
<user1> Well , I'm afraid it's not at all what I wanted . You haven't really followed my instructions.It ' ll have to be done again .
<user0> Oh , dear !
<user1> oh , yes . I want to check whether you still have any vacancies . I need three single rooms for next Monday .
<user0> ok . There're vacancies . Since the peak season is coming , it's advisable to book soon . Would you like to make a reservation now ?
<user1> yes , please . Do you take credit cards ?
<user0> yes , we accept all major credit cards .
<user1> and how about Internet access ?
<user0> there's free Internet access in the lobby .
<user1> is it available in the rooms ?
<user0> Unfortunately not .
<user1> that's OK . Is breakfast included ?
<user0> yes , breakfast is included and parking is available .
<user1> fantastic . Thank you very much .
<user0> you're welcome . And we have 24 hour reception . Please don't hesitate to call anytime if you have any further questions .
<user1> You should ask for a holiday and relax yourself for a little bit . You worked so hard .
<user0> You are right . For the past few weeks , I had no appetite and couldn ' t sleep well . What ' s worse my back started aching this Monday . It is time for me to take a vacation .
<user1> Call me John . This is a great area of the city for shopping . There ' s a grocery store just around the corner .
<user0> What about things other than food ?
<user1> Well , the Riverside Mall has 200 stores in it , including four major department stores .
<user0> Are there small shops near here as well ?
<user1> Yes , on 4th street , near the movie theater there are many specialty shops , including clothing boutiques .
<user0> Well , that sounds just wonderful .
<user1> Yes , it ' s a really nice neighborhood .
<user1> Oh , no , Nathan , I ... I really think we've bought this flat at the right time , you know.Market prices are going to go up , and I think you'll find in a year or two it will be worth a lot more .
<user0> But we're going to spend so much money in furnishing and decorating . I think we could get a much cheaper place that's already furnished .
<user1> But don't you like this place ? I remember when we came to see it we thought it would be lovely .
<user0> Well , only you liked it really , darling .
<user1> Oh , why didn't you say so then ? But I still think we've made a good buy .
<user1> More or less . There's just one thing bothering me .
<user0> Oh ? What's that ?
<user1> Well , you know I have some students studying for their master's degree . One of them tried to give me a gift that kinda made me uneasy .
<user0> What gift ?
<user1> It's an Egyptian carpet . The student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude . Seeing what gift was , I was really uncomfortable . I mean it's too expensive a gift for a student to give a professor . I don't think I've done anything to deserve that gift , so I refused it .
<user0> You refused the gift ? That's terrible .
<user1> I know , but I really can't accept such an expensive gift . I explained to him why , but he seemed really upset about it . I think he might have taken it the wrong way .
<user0> Perhaps . He probably thinks you considered the gift a bribe for a higher grade .
<user1> That's what I am worried about . I do understand the respect attached with the gift and I am honored . But I really don't think it's proper for a student to spend a fortune on a gift for a professor . I think we need to have a talk to make sure we are on the same page .
<user1> We have no pool , sir , but we do have swim stations in our gym .
<user0> Swim stations ? Could you be a little more explicit ?
<user1> You know how you run on a treadmill but don't go anywhere ? Well , it's the same thing .
<user0> Gee , that's a great idea . Now , how much do I have to pay ?
<user1> The stations are absolutely free to guests , sir .
<user0> Great ! Now , when can I go down there and use the stations ?
<user1> The swim stations are open daily from 7 a . m . to 10 p . m .
<user0> Boy , oh boy ! I can't wait to change into my swim trunks .
<user1> Be warned , sir . At certain hours the swim stations are very crowded .
<user1> OK . Here is my application form and all the documents .
<user0> Can you tell me why do you want a visa to America ?
<user1> Because I want to have a view of the exotic landscapes to extend my views and understanding of the world .
<user0> OK . Do you plan to go to America all by yourself or with your family ?
<user1> Myself .
<user0> Have you finished all you preparation ?
<user1> Yes . Everything is ready .
<user1> Dear friends . Here , I wish to say a word of thanks for holding this send-off party for me . Actually I didn't expect at all for this . I owe a lot to all of you here . It's been 5 days since I came to visit here . Time really flies . I feel grateful for your welcome and help in the five days . I will miss you while I am leaving . Let's keep in touch in any way . What's more , to the success of our face-to-face meeting , to the upcoming cooperation of our two companies , bottom up !
<user0> Cheers ! And we are honored to have such an honored guest today . Mr . James , I hope we will meet somewhere in the near future .
<user1> Madam , we also welcome you to visit our company . I hope you can also bring your family there to have a look of our company . In this way , we will know each other better .
<user0> Definitely ! Thank you !
<user1> I have time to speak with you . Where would you like to purchase your house ?
<user0> I am most interested in Pasadena or Arcadia , but would be open to other suggestions .
<user1> How many bedrooms and bathrooms do you need ?
<user0> We have several generations of family living in our household and so need a very large home .
<user1> Do you need to be located in a particular school district ?
<user0> It doesn ' t matter , as we do not have any children .
<user1> Is a view important to you , or would you rather be located on a lakeshore lot ?
<user0> In a perfect world , we would like a home with a view of the lake .
<user1> Thank you for all of the information . I will help you find the perfect house for you .
<user1> Would you like anything else ?
<user0> No , thanks . Please bring us the bill .
<user1> All right . And do you want to separate bills or just one single bill ?
<user0> Separate bills , please .
<user1> Here is your bill . It comes to 80 yuan . And yours is 60 yuan .
<user0> Here you are . Thank you
<user1> Sorry , We don't take returns on sale items .
<user1> It's famous for beautiful countryside with clean air .
<user0> Oh , that's what I am looking for . Do you have a reduction for 6 persons ?
<user1> Yes , sir . We offer a 10 % discount for groups more than 5 .
<user1> Have you chosen the material ?
<user0> Yes , I want it to made of tweed .
<user1> Fine . And the charge is $ 100 .
<user0> When will it be available ?
<user1> Next Wednesday .
<user1> I'm ready now . I'd like the roast chicken and a side order of corn .
<user0> And would you like an appetizer before your meal ? The soup of the day is our delicious tomato soup .
<user1> I'll pass on the soup , but I'd like a garden salad .
<user0> Can I get you anything to drink ?
<user1> Yes , I'd like a glass of iced tea .
<user0> Okay . I'll be back in a minute with your drink and salad .
<user1> Thank you .
<user1> My present pay is 100,000 Yuan per year .
<user0> What are your salary expectations now ?
<user1> I like to be paid more than that . Hopefully , 120,000 Yuan per year .
<user0> That's a little more than we had planned .
<user1> I think you'll find I'm worth that .
<user0> I can only offer you 110,000 Yuan a year . Raises will be given after a three-month probation according to your performance . Is that satisfactory ?
<user1> Yes , it is quite reasonable .
<user1> Yes , sir.Just a minute , please , I'll check with the kitchen .
<user0> Thank you for waiting.It takes another ten to fifteen minutes , I'm afraid .
<user1> We have an appointment in half an hour .
<user0> I see .
<user1> Do you have anything else I can have instead ?
<user0> Well , yes.How about beef stew ? We can serve you at once .
<user1> I'll take beef stew , then .
<user1> Congratulations , Bob ! That ' s great news , what ' s her name ?
<user0> We ' Ve named her Alice after my wife ' s grandmother .
<user1> That ' s a pretty name . Give your wife my best !
<user1> You can find one at the end of the street .
<user0> Are there any signs there ?
<user1> No.but there are quite many cars .
<user0> Thank you .
<user1> I'm sorry , but she won't have any openings until 11:00 , unless there's a cancellation .
<user0> Would 1 : OO p . m . be convenient ?
<user1> Yes , she's free then .
<user1> You should go to the dentist .
<user0> I hate dentists .
<user1> Well , suffer then . If you have a toothache , you have to go to the dentist .
<user0> It always hurts . I hate going .
<user1> Stop being such a baby . If it really hurts that much , just let them knock you out .
<user0> O . K . , O . K . , I ' ll go .
<user1> Good . You feel better after you do .
<user1> Amalgamated Trading Company . It's Swiss . Don't you think working at a foreign company would be glamorous ?
<user0> Yeah , I guess so . I've never actually heard of this one , but ...
<user1> Well , it's small , but it's a young , dynamic , rapidly-growing company with a progressive , humanistic philosophy .
<user0> You didn't read their brochure or anything , did you ?
<user1> Four times . I'm totally prepared . Oh , no ! I forgot to take off my nail polish ! And I have to be there in 15 minutes ! That's it . I blew it .
<user0> Well , they are progressive and humanistic-maybe they don't care about nail polish ... uh ... even blue nail polish . Just keep your confidence up and you'll do great .
<user1> But the competition is fierce this year ... and it seems like I'm the only one left who hasn't found a job .
<user0> Not quite the only one . I really wanted that job at the magazine , but I still haven't heard from them .
<user1> I'm sorry , hold on a moment . I'll check it out . But we have already shipped it to you last month . Would you like us to contact the express company to know what's going on ?
<user0> Please find out the reason as soon as possible . We are in bad need of it .
<user1> Ok , I am terribly sorry for the trouble you are getting into.We will contact you first thing , once we know the reason .
<user1> What are you going to cook ?
<user0> I haven't the slightest clue what I'm going to make .
<user1> A teriyaki bowl sounds nice .
<user0> I don't know how to make that .
<user1> All you need to make it is white rice and some teriyaki beef .
<user0> That sounds fairly simple , but how do I cook it ?
<user1> The first and simplest thing you have to do is make some white rice .
<user0> What's next ?
<user1> Then you should shred your beef and pour some teriyaki marinade over it .
<user0> What's the next thing I need to do ?
<user1> Then all you need to do is cook it and enjoy .
<user1> You need all your receipts for reimbursement .
<user0> You mean I have to attach the receipts with the expense report ?
<user1> Yes , here is the form for an expense report . Fill it out and give it to me . I ' ll get it signed for you .
<user1> Can I speak to Miss Cooper please ?
<user0> Would you hold on a second , please ? Miss Cooper's extension is engaged .
<user1> Engaged . Oh , dear ! Could you tell her it's a long-distance call ?
<user0> I'm sorry , sir . I can't interrupt her . I'm sure she won't be very long .
<user1> How long do you think she'll be ?
<user0> I really can't say how long she'll be .
<user1> Can I leave a message , please ?
<user0> Yes , certainly .
<user1> Can you tell her I'm waiting to speak to her ?
<user0> Yes , sir . I'll ring her on an inside line if you like .
<user1> Thank you very much .
<user1> Wait a moment . Here you are .
<user0> By the way , we would like to order some dishes for my friend .
<user1> Sure .
<user1> Sure . What's it , Yvonne ?
<user0> I want to put my desk over there , but it's too heavy for me to move .
<user1> Okay , you take one end and I'll take the other .
<user1> Hello . I hope you can help me ; I'm a little worried about my new card .
<user0> What seems to be the problem ?
<user1> I received my new card this morning , but I'm unable to use it .
<user0> Oh ? You mean , the ATM machine has eaten it ?
<user1> No , it's right here , see ? The ATM will not accept it !
<user0> You said you received your card this morning , am I right ?
<user1> Yes . I was told it would be activated and ready to use right away . So , what's gone wrong ?
<user0> Did you receive your PIN number yet , Madam ? You see , unless you have your new PIN number , to match your new card , you cannot use it . We usually send that separately , around one day after the card , for security reasons .
<user1> Well , that explains it . I've been using my old PIN number ! Thanks for explaining everything to me .
<user1> Why not ? See .
<user0> Good mastery . How do you like our Chinese food ?
<user1> Oh , great ! It's delicious . You see , I am already putting on weight . There is one thing I don't like however , MSG .
<user0> What's wrong with MSG ? It helps to bring out the taste of the food .
<user1> According to some studies it may cause cancer .
<user0> Oh , don't let that worry you . If that were true , China wouldn't have such a large population .
<user1> I just happen to have a question for you guys . Why do the Chinese cook the vegetables ? You see what I mean is that most vitamin are destroyed when heated .
<user0> I don't know exactly . It's a tradition . Maybe it's for sanitary reasons .
<user1> It was a nightmare .
<user0> What ' s up ?
<user1> Actually , the business trip itself was very successful . We arrived on time , we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year .
<user0> Sounds quite fruitful , why do you call it still a nightmare then ?
<user1> Well , the air line lost my luggage on the return flight and then I lost my carry on bag when I was tackling with the officers in charge . I left the airport three hours later than I expected and then I was caught in a traffic jam . When I finally got home , I was totally exhausted . But I found the elevator was out of service due to a blackout .
<user0> This is really a sad story . Did they trace back your luggage ?
<user1> I am still waiting for their call .
<user0> Take it easy , all sufferings have their reward .
<user1> Yes , could you put me in the no-smoking section ?
<user0> Yes . Would you like a window seat ?
<user1> If one's available , please . But not over the wing .
<user1> Good morning . This is Paul Alexander calling from the Isis Advertising Firm . We need a car to the airport for Mr . Phillips .
<user0> Certainly , Mr . Alexander . When would Mr . Phillips like to leave ?
<user1> Let me check ... His flight ' s at 2:30 p . m . , so he should leave no later than 12 noon .
<user1> Can you tell me which credit card it was for ?
<user0> It was for my Master Card .
<user1> You should've gotten that bill two weeks ago .
<user0> I haven't got it in the mail yet .
<user1> The computer is showing that all bills have been mailed .
<user0> What am I supposed to do about my bill then ?
<user1> Maybe you should call your post office .
<user0> But if it's their mistake , can I get an extension on my bill payment ?
<user1> Yes , but you will need to send us proof of their mistake .
<user0> Okay , thank you very much for your help .
<user1> Not a problem . Enjoy the rest of your day .
<user1> Yes . It's a feast of eyes to walking in the museum .
<user0> Let's take our time and enjoy the art and sprite of the famous museum .
<user1> What a shame that we can't take pictures .
<user1> I really would rather just listen . Isn't there anyone else who wants to sing ?
<user0> Come on ! In the two hours we've been here you haven't sung even one song !
<user1> I know , but ... Hey , Stanley's here ! I've been wanting to hear him sing all night .
<user0> Well , you asked for it . Why don't you put on an Elvis song for him . He loves " The King . "
<user1> I'll put the song at the front of the list .
<user1> Oh , you are so efficient . I thought you might give it to me tomorrow . Thanks .
<user0> You ' re welcome . You know , these days I have been reflecting on my biggest weakness procrastination . The more I think about it , the more I hate myself for being so disorganized . I decided to change the situation as soon as possible . Otherwise I will be more regretful later .
<user1> This is encouraging news , good for you ! What is your solution , then ?
<user0> The most useful method is to make plans and set priorities . It helps me to manage time well and get the most important things done at the first place .
<user1> Sounds not bad ! Better performance isn ' t just about doing a lot more . It is about focusing on the right things to do .
<user1> Fine , just fine.How about you ?
<user0> Not too bad .
<user1> Thank you , Mr . Cooper . I hope we get the contract .
<user1> Pork chops .
<user1> I think I caught a cold .
<user0> Do you have any symptoms ?
<user1> Runny nose and coughing .
<user0> Do you have a fever ?
<user1> I have just taken the temperature , I don't think so .
<user0> It's not serious .
<user1> Are you sure ?
<user0> Yes .
<user1> What should I do ?
<user0> You should drink more hot water , and do some exercise .
<user1> It should be close to the university . Neither of us are good at getting up in the mornings and closer it is , the later we can get up .
<user0> Absolutely . That's the most important thing to take into consideration . I'm not too worried about the size of the flat .
<user1> Neither am I . so a small place is ok , but we'll get a bigger one if it's not expensive . Do you mind if it's in a noisy area .
<user0> I don't mind . I'm not a light sleeper , but quieter is better for when we have to study at home .
<user1> Good point . Ok , let's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us .
<user0> Yes , if we're lucky we'll find something in the next few days . I think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early .
<user1> How much do you think the rent will be ?
<user0> I asked a few people who are already living in places near the university and they said it would cost about one hundred pounds a month .
<user1> Well , is it possible for you to effect shipment by the middle of June ?
<user0> The earliest we can do is by the end of June .
<user1> Yes , I did some part-time jobs such as English tutor , salesman , and model .
<user0> What did you learn from your part-time jobs ?
<user1> I learned to be patient , professional and gained a ll of experience of direct sales .
<user1> Well , since we are getting up so late , I decided to make a big breakfast !
<user0> Nice ! Brunch !
<user1> Kind of , so I made scrambled and soft boiled eggs , some french toast and buttermilk pancakes !
<user0> Wow ! You really went all out ! Did you make any coffee ?
<user1> Yeah , just the way you like it ! I also put out some cereal and muesli if you feel like having something more light .
<user0> Looks good ! I ' ll squeeze us some fresh orange juice .
<user1> Get the jam and butter while you are in there ! Oh ! And don ' t forget the syrup !
<user1> Yes . Flight DB117 departs at 5:38 pm and arrives in New York at 6:00 am with a layover in Chicago . It also makes a refueling stop at Colombia .
<user0> So many stops ! Don't you have any direct flights ?
<user1> Sorry sir , it is the only flight wa have right now .
<user1> Would you turn off the tap ?
<user0> I did it .
<user1> Then will you put all the towels under the bathroom door ?
<user0> OK . I will .
<user1> I'll have our housekeeper come right away .
<user0> I'm sorry I was too tired to fall asleep .
<user1> When you woke up , the water was coming out of the tub .
<user0> Right.Can I compensate for the damage with the travel accident insurance ?
<user1> No thanks . I'm full . We need to find our waitress and get our bill .
<user0> The waitress is bringing the bill right now .
<user1> This waitress has really been on top of things , hasn't she ?
<user0> Yes , this waitress did a great job .
<user1> OK , let's see what the damage is . The total for our meal is $ 36.00 .
<user0> What do you think would be the right amount to leave for a tip ?
<user1> Fifteen percent is a normal tip , but she really did a great job . What do you think about 20 % this time ?
<user0> Yes , 20 % would be perfect .
<user1> Her tip will end up being $ 7.20 plus the bill of $ 36.00 . The total will be $ 43.20 .
<user0> Yes , that was one fantastic meal !
<user1> I agree . Maybe we can come back again next week .
<user1> Would you like me to go with you ?
<user0> I ' d rather you stayed in the office and did these things .
<user1> Do you want to type that letter ?
<user0> I ' d rather you typed it .
<user1> Do you want to tell her ?
<user0> I ' d rather you told her .
<user1> What crime did I commit ?
<user0> You are suspected of hiding illegal drugs , so we are taking you into custody . We ' Ve found some heroin in your house . You have the following rights while you are being interviewed . You have the right to remain silent . You don't have to make any statement against your will . You have the right to defense counsel . You have the right to request an investigation of evidence favorable to your case . Do you understand your rights ?
<user1> I am innocent .
<user1> Well , let's see . Why don't we go dancing for a change ? We haven't done that for a long time .
<user0> Well , to tell the truth , I don't really feel like it tonight . I had a pretty hard day and I'm sort of tired .
<user1> Hmm . Well , in that case , we could go to the movies .
<user0> Oh , we always go to the movies . Can't we do something different ?
<user1> Well , do you have any suggestions ?
<user0> Let's see . How do you feel about playing bridge ?
<user1> It's OK with me , but we don't have any beer and things .
<user0> Well , shall I call Janet and ask her and Tom to come over , and I'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
<user1> OK .
<user0> Hello , Janet . It's me ... Oh , fine . Just fine . Say , Janet , I was wondering if you and Tom were doing anything tonight ... No ? Well . would you like to come by our place and play a few hands of bridge ?
<user1> Good night , mum .
<user0> Good night .
<user1> Yes . How do I get an outside line , please ?
<user0> Just dial 0 , wait for the dial tone , and then dial the phone number you want to call . Or we can place a call for you , if you want .
<user1> No , thanks a lot . I'll try it myself .
<user1> This go-around we're focusing on new moms , families with median income and one or more children under the age of two .
<user0> Do you think that's much different from the succor moms we tailored the last campaign for ?
<user1> Well , there are some similarities that come up . Because both groups are made up of mothers ... so as before , we can play up on maternal instincts , hygiene , safety , along those lines . But that being said , there are some specific differences that come into play because we are dealing with mothers of infants here .
<user0> Right , that makes sense . What's the average age ?
<user1> Demographics say an average age of 28.7 , educational background of university or post-grad , annual household income of 40-50 K a year .
<user1> Yes , sir , I'll be there in just a moment .
<user0> John , I have been watching you . I've been paying attention to you over the last quarter and I'm impressed . You've done a tremendous job in tackling some difficult accounts . I just want to let you to know , after this month's performance reviews , I'm recommending you for promotion .
<user1> Gosh sir , thank you , sir ! I had no idea there were any positions opening up in our department .
<user0> Well , it's not going to be in our department . I've recommended you for an interdepartmental transfer . There's supervisory spot opening up in financial . I'm turning your name in for it .
<user1> Management ? Wow , I had no idea I could move so quickly from entry level to managerial staff .
<user0> You've earned it .
<user1> I am returning something that I bought yesterday .
<user0> What would you like to return ?
<user1> I'm returning a cellphone .
<user0> Was there something wrong with it ?
<user1> It's defective .
<user0> What isn't working on it ?
<user1> It keeps turning off on it's own .
<user0> Alright , do you have the receipt ?
<user1> I have it right here .
<user0> I'm going to take care of this and refund your money .
<user1> Thanks for your help .
<user1> Dear , let ' s drop the subject .
<user1> Good morning . I'd like to cash this check .
<user0> Yes , sir . Can you show you identity ?
<user1> What about the driving license ?
<user0> Don't you have any other identification ?
<user1> I am sorry . I only have my driving license with me .
<user0> Ok . Would you please sign your name on the back of the check ?
<user1> Thank you . Here you are .
<user0> How do you want your money ?
<user1> Would you give me some in twenties and tens ?
<user0> All right . Please wait for a moment .
<user1> All right .
<user0> Have you got any identification ?
<user1> Yes , here's my ID card .
<user1> What ? What did you buy ?
<user0> It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it !
<user1> What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ?
<user0> There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick .
<user1> And ?
<user0> So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks .
<user1> And it's a brick ?
<user0> Yes .
<user1> I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ?
<user0> I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new .
<user1> So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic .
<user0> Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new .
<user1> But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ?
<user0> He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen .
<user1> Aha ! Now I understand.You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk.So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated !
<user0> C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it.We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box .
<user1> That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there.Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks .
<user0> You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ?
<user1> Hey doc . Well , I think I might need glasses . I ' m getting headaches , and I really struggle to see things that are far away . But I have always had 20/20 vision .
<user0> Sounds like you may be far-sighted . OK , then , cover your left eye and read the chart in front of you .
<user1> Mmm .. . X , E , R , 3 , a question mark , and I can ' t quite make out the other symbol but I think it ' s the peace sign .
<user0> Wow , Arthur ! You ' re as blind as a bat !
<user1> Yeah , I know , my vision is really blurry at times .
<user0> Ok then , head on over to the other room and pick out some frames while I fill out your prescription .
<user1> Thanks doc !
<user0> Arthur , that ' s the bathroom .
<user1> No thanks . I'm full . We need to find our waitress and get our bill .
<user0> Good luck finding the waitress !
<user1> The service this evening has kind of sucked . Is that our server over there ?
<user0> I'll go get the check , since our server doesn't seem to be headed this way .
<user1> Good . I'll just stay here until you get back .
<user0> So the total is $ 36.00 for our dinner .
<user1> How much of a tip do you think our waitress deserves ?
<user0> I wonder if no tip would be appropriate in light of the service .
<user1> I kind of feel the same way , but they may have just been really short-staffed tonight .
<user0> I think that we should leave 10 % .
<user1> $ 3.60 will be the right amount for the tip .
<user1> Let me see what's available .
<user0> By the way , I'd prefer a night flight .
<user1> Africa Airline 551 leaves at 9:00 pm .
<user0> That's fine . I want to pay in cash . Here is the money .
<user1> Take a guess .
<user1> Very likely . You have a slight fever . Do you have a headache , too ?
<user0> Yes . I wonder if you could do something to help me recover soon , because I'll be on a business trip in two days .
<user1> Well , you have to let your flu run its course . You must stop working and stay in bed to get plenty of rest . Usually it will take 4 to 6 days to make a full recovery .
<user0> But I'm going on a business trip in two days !
<user1> Maybe you'll have to cancel it or postpone it . If you go out while you are sick , it won't help you recover . You may even pass your disease on to others .
<user1> No , thanks . I'm fine .
<user1> If that's what you want to do , then we can .
<user0> Did you buckle your seatbelt ?
<user1> I'm buckled up . What's next ?
<user0> You need to start the car now .
<user1> What do you want me to do ?
<user0> Go left .
<user1> How far should I go ?
<user0> I'll let you know when I want you to stop .
<user1> Tell me before you want me to stop .
<user0> All right , try parking here .
<user1> Thanks . Let's go driving again tomorrow .
<user1> I ' m making a deposit today .
<user0> Cash or check ?
<user1> I would like to deposit a check .
<user0> You need to sign the back .
<user1> Okay . Here you go .
<user0> Would you like cash back ?
<user1> Yes , I would .
<user0> How much ?
<user1> Let me get $ 150 back .
<user0> Here you go .
<user1> Thank you . Have a good one .
<user1> Are you on a tourist visa or a student visa ?
<user0> Student visa .
<user1> What is the reason for extension ?
<user0> I'll go into a practical training as soon as I receive my Master ' s degree from the University of Pennsylvania early next month .
<user1> We ' ll need a letter from your university and a financial statement from you .
<user1> I absolutely love the apartment .
<user0> Everything is okay ?
<user1> I do have one problem with the apartment .
<user0> What ' s the problem ?
<user1> I don ' t like all those stains in the carpet .
<user0> We will have the carpet cleaned before you move into the apartment .
<user1> I did not know that .
<user0> I assure you that we will , and if there are any more problems , feel free to tell me .
<user1> That was the only thing that I saw wrong with the apartment .
<user0> I ' m glad to know that you think the apartment is so nice .
<user1> It ' s absolutely incredible . I ' ll take it .
<user1> Good morning .
<user0> Would you like something to drink ?
<user1> No , thank you . I just had two cups of coffee at my desk .
<user0> So , you're a serious coffee drinker .
<user1> Yes , it keeps me going . Sometimes I think I'm addicted .
<user0> Well , coffee isn't such a bad thing.Everyone has to have something.For me , it's cigars . Are you a cigar smoker ?
<user1> No , I've tried them . But I'm not really a smoker .
<user0> Well , what would you like to talk to me about ?
<user1> I wanted to set up this meeting with you to discuss a little proposal .
<user0> I'm glad when people have new ideas around here . Tell me about it .
<user1> It is about the staff meetings.You know how we have a staff meeting every Tuesday .
<user0> Yes .
<user1> Well , I have been thinking about it.And I believe we could do things more efficiently here .
<user0> What do you suggest ?
<user1> The way it is now , the staff from all four branches get together once a week.We meet for one hour . But I think a lot of time is wasted in transportation .
<user0> You mean because people have to go across town to get here .
<user1> Yes . Some people spend half of the morning on the road .
<user0> That's true . But our staff meetings are very important , Arnold . I don't know how we can function without them .
<user1> I think they are important too.That ' s why I want people to have a better attitude about them .
<user0> I know a lot of people think the meetings aren't too useful . I'm aware of that .
<user1> Here's what I propose . I think we should meet once every two weeks , but meet for ninety minutes or more .
<user0> Well .
<user1> I also think the meetings should be more focused.And I would be willing to take responsibility for that .
<user0> You mean you want to run the meetings ?
<user1> No , not really run them . But I could help organize them . I could discuss meeting topics with you , and then prepare a schedule for each meeting . I could then send an e-mail to all the staff to explain the coming meeting.This way the meetings would become more focused , and people would prepare better .
<user0> Hmm . But we would meet every two weeks .
<user1> I really think it would work.The meetings could be longer , and better organized .
<user0> I am not against the idea , Arnold.It may really be more efficient , as you say . I'll tell you what we can do.Why don't we try your proposal for a month , and see how it works .
<user1> Excellent . I would be happy to get started on it .
<user0> I will call the managers.Then tomorrow I'll tell you when we can schedule our first meeting in this " new style . "
<user1> Sure . How about this one ?
<user0> Is this the latest edition ?
<user1> Yes . We have both the paperback and the hardcover .
<user0> What's the difference ?
<user1> The hardcover is more expensive .
<user0> Oh ! I see . I'll have the paperback , please .
<user1> I would like the round-way ticket to Shanghai on December 10th .
<user0> Lady , let me check . Do you want the morning or the afternoon flight ?
<user1> What's the departure time ?
<user0> 2:30
<user1> Well , the afternoon will be fine .
<user0> First class or economy ?
<user1> First class will be preferred .
<user0> Well , afternoon flight on December 10th to Shanghai . May I have your name , please ?
<user1> My name is Janice . Well , I book this ticket for Nova , the marketing manager of Pineapple Computer Company . Where can I get the flight ticket ?
<user0> You may take it up at the ticket office . That is located on International Street 150 .
<user1> I can ' t stand up ! My stomach is killing me !
<user0> Can you put your hand where it hurts the most ?
<user1> It hurts smack in the middle of my gut !
<user0> Did this just come on suddenly ?
<user1> I felt OK until an hour or so ago , and then I just doubled over .
<user0> Have you exercised strenuously or played sports recently ?
<user1> No , and I don ' t usually get a lot of stomachaches .
<user0> We need to get you to an emergency room to see what the problem is .
<user1> I think that that is the best way to figure out what is causing this . Thank you .
<user1> Yes , I would like to exchange some money .
<user0> what currency would you like to trade in ?
<user1> I would like to exchange Chinese RIB for American dollars . Do you accept $ 100 bills ?
<user0> No problem , we can accept any denomination . How much would you like to exchange today ?
<user1> Well , that depends on the rate . How much is the RIB trading at today ?
<user0> It's a shame you didn't come a little earlier , the exchange rate was reset yesterday afternoon . The American dollar is now worth 7.45RMB.If you would like to sell RIB , we can give you a rate of 7.35.Will that be all right ?
<user1> I guess , here , give me 5,000 RIB worth . I might as well exchange a little extra . Who knows what the exchange rate will be tomorrow !
<user1> Next week , it ' s going to be quite a shock for him !
<user0> He ' ll get used to it . They always do . I still remember when my daughter started . Are you going with him on his first day ?
<user1> You bet . I wouldn ' t miss it !
<user1> I'm sorry . Mr.Huang is quite busy right now . Could I pass him the message ?
<user0> Well , you see , I won't be able to keep my 9
<user1> Let me see . He's free from 3:00 to 4:30 tomorrow afternoon . Can you make it then ?
<user0> Yes , of course . Thank you very much .
<user1> You're quite welcome . Thank you for calling . Bye-byeB
<user1> Don't rush , behave yourself please ! Let the people get off first .
<user0> Oh , we should . There are so many people . What if the train got full before we could get in ?
<user1> But , if we all pushed our way in , nobody could get off , and nobody could get in either .
<user0> How many stops are there to the Aidan station ?
<user1> There are four more stops .
<user0> Oh , my God !
<user1> What's wrong ? You are like a little monkey , on pins and needles !
<user0> Because I need to use the restroom . Is there a restroom on the train ?
<user1> No , not on the train , but in the station .
<user0> Why not ? You told me that subway is a kind of train . If it had no restroom . what kind of train would that be ?
<user1> Well , that is a question . You want to offer a suggestion ?
<user0> Oh , yeah , but not today . I am busy with praying the subway may get there as fast as possible .
<user1> I guess you'll never forget today .
<user1> Lamb and beef . It will get even tastier when we add the veggies !
<user0> Hey ! Watch out ! You're using the same spoon for both broths !
<user1> So ?
<user0> You're getting that hot stuff in my mild broth !
<user1> You'll be OK . It's just a little bit ...
<user1> I would like to sign up for some classes .
<user0> What classes did you want to sign up for ?
<user1> I need to take a driver's course .
<user0> You'll have to make an appointment .
<user1> What do I need to make an appointment for ?
<user0> You need an appointment so you can sign the papers .
<user1> All right , can I make an appointment right now ?
<user0> When are you available ?
<user1> Can I make it for tomorrow at 9
<user0> I can schedule you for that day and time .
<user1> Thanks a lot . I'll be there tomorrow .
<user1> Hello . Is Mr . Stewart there ?
<user0> This is Mr . Stewart . Who ' s this ?
<user1> I ' m calling from Bell Canada . We are currently offering a great deal on long distance calling , only $ 17 a month . With this plan you get 500 minutes of long distance calls each month without any additional charges .
<user0> I ' m sorry . I ' m not interested in it .
<user1> Okay . Thanks .
<user1> Yes sir . How can I help you ?
<user0> Please clean up the table .
<user1> OK . And anything else I can do for you ?
<user0> I like a refill please .
<user1> Sure .
<user1> No problem , sir . Just tell me your name , phone number , and date of reservation .
<user0> Great ! I'm Rudy Randolph , 818-555-1234 , and my reservation was for April 9 to 15 .
<user1> Okay , sir , let me hit the delete button , and your reservation will be cancelled .
<user0> That was nice and fast . Thanks .
<user1> Not at all .
<user1> We can print as many as you like . Just tell me how many .
<user0> Two thousand should get me through the year .
<user1> Here's a form to get you started .
<user0> My old card is perfect , so all I want you to do is copy it exactly .
<user1> I think you'll be very pleased with how well we duplicate your old card .
<user0> ... Here you go
<user1> Thanks . Come back here next Wednesday to pick up your order , please .
<user0> I'm sorry , but can you give me a three-day turnaround ?
<user1> If you don't mind paying a little extra , it's absolutely no problem .
<user1> No , there's no such section . The dairy section is where you'll find milk and cheese .
<user0> What's Condiments ?
<user1> That's where you'll find things like salt and pepper .
<user0> Oh , I see .
<user1> Let's go to aisle 4 to pick up some pasta for tonight .
<user0> Great ! Pasta for dinner .
<user1> And let's get a loaf of bread at the bakery for breakfast .
<user0> Maybe we should get a shopping cart .
<user1> I'll put the shopping basket back .
<user1> All except the back door . I left that open for Tim . He took the dog for a walk .
<user0> Well , I'm going on to bed . I'm beat .
<user1> Okay . I'm going to stay up a while . I've got to go over the household budget . We're a little overspent this month .
<user0> Please tell Tim to close the door to the basement . I don't want the dog down there tonight .
<user1> Okay . Good night . See you at breakfast .
<user1> I feel kind of stupid .
<user0> Why ?
<user1> We got lost coming back . I guess I don't really know this town yet .
<user0> You got lost . You're kidding !
<user1> No . We took a wrong turn somewhere.And Joseph doesn't know the town at all . So I started giving him directions.But I didn't really know where we were . So we got seriously lost .
<user0> You could have called .
<user1> I know I could have . But finally we asked someone where we were .
<user0> You've been gone for two hours . How could you get lost for so long ?
<user1> Guess where we ended up .
<user0> I don't know . Where ?
<user1> When we finally decided to ask someone , they told us we were in Grangerfield .
<user0> Grangerfield ! You were in Grangerfield ? That's a completely different town ! How could you drive to a completely different town ?
<user1> I don't know.The person we asked had to give us directions to the highway to get back here .
<user0> Grangerfield is like a dozen miles away from here .
<user1> I know it is . I don't know how it happened .
<user0> Hmm , maybe I do .
<user1> What ?
<user0> Maybe I have an idea how it happened .
<user1> How ?
<user0> You were too busy looking at Joseph , and you weren't paying attention to the road .
<user1> Oh , that's what you think , huh ?
<user1> Yes , thanks .
<user0> It's my grandmother's favorite recipe for barbecue .
<user1> It's very good . How do you make it ?
<user0> I use a special dressing and homemade catsup .
<user1> This salad looks so nice-just right for a hot day .
<user0> I'm glad you like it .
<user1> You Americans usually have nutritious food .
<user0> Oh , but Chinese food is so delicious . I wish I knew how to cook Chinese food . Do you follow recipes ?
<user1> We use different spices but few people use recipes . They learn to cook by experience .
<user0> I always use a recipe but my grandmother never did . She was a great cook . She would make clam chowder and cornbread every Sunday night .
<user1> Do you realize that all these shoes are half off ?
<user0> Really ?
<user1> Yes , but the offer only lasts this week .
<user1> Yes , I used to have a part-time job in advertising company .
<user0> What were you mean duties there ?
<user1> I mostly did advertising planning .
<user0> What qualities do you think an advertising planner should have ?
<user1> I think an advertising planner should have active thoughts , creative talent , and be sensitive to the changes in the market .
<user0> What was the most important thing you have learned at work ?
<user1> The most important thing I learned was that I must continuously improve my abilities . Advertising is a constantly evolving trade and creativity is an important fact in success . If I want to make in marking in advertising history , I can ' t stop studying and creating .
<user1> Oh , honey , I'm so sorry , we don't have enough space for you to have your own room .
<user0> Dad , but I don't want to share a room with Peter . He snores every night .
<user1> Honey , you can ask him to be quite . Otherwise you may punish him and tell him to stand out of the room , right ?
<user0> Alright . Maybe it's the only way to do it .
<user1> I've got a terrible pain in my stomach , Doctor .
<user0> I see . When did it start ?
<user1> It started yesterday . I didn't eat any supper .
<user0> Have you got a temperature ?
<user1> I think so . I feel very hot .
<user0> Let's see . Yes . You ' Ve got quite a high temperature .
<user1> I've got an awful headache , too , and my throat hurts .
<user0> Hm ... I think you ' Ve got the flu .
<user1> Is it serious ?
<user0> No , not at all , but you must stay in bed for three days and take this medicine .
<user1> How often must I take it ?
<user0> Three times a day after meals .
<user1> Thank you , Doctor.Goodbye .
<user1> Just a moment and I'll check . We ' re expecting a delivery on Friday . We've only got ten in stock at the moment . I can deliver those by first thing tomorrow morning . There'll be an extra charge for special delivery . I'll have to send them by courier .
<user1> I don ' t want to .
<user0> Well , come and talk to me then .
<user1> Certainly not .
<user0> May I turn on the radio then ?
<user1> Turn on the radio ? What for ?
<user0> So that we can sit down together and listen to some music .
<user1> Listen to some music ? And who ' ll cook dinner ? Will you ?
<user0> Ok , I will . But let ' s go to a disco after dinner .
<user1> To a disco ? Oh , no . You know I hate pop .
<user1> Yes . Can I deposit valuables here ?
<user0> Of course , you can . Please put your articles in this bag and seal it .
<user1> OK .
<user0> Thank you . Here is your tag .
<user1> Would you tell me the rate per day for depositing my bag ?
<user0> Sure , madam . Only one dollar .
<user1> When does the cloakroom close ?
<user0> This cloakroom is open until 10 p . m .
<user1> Oh , dear ! I won't be back until about 11:30 tonight . Where can I pick up my bag ?
<user0> We will transfer your bag to the Lobby Floor Cloakroom . You may collect it there , madam .
<user1> I see . Thanks a lot .
<user0> You're welcome .
<user1> Sure .
<user0> How long does it take ?
<user1> 6 hours . If you are in a hurry we can develop it in 3 hours .
<user0> There is no need . I will come back tomorrow .
<user1> I think my husband has some .
<user0> Are you sure he ' s purchased enough insurance for both of you ? If something terrible happened with your husband , and he doesn ' t have sufficient insurance , my company does have a policy that could cover you and your husband if something happened to either of you .
<user1> That ' s true . If something happened to my husband , I might lose everything . Both of us have to work to keep our home , car , and our children ' s education . I can ' t afford that by myself .
<user0> Could we sit and look at the policy I mentioned and see if that ' s something suitable for you and your husband ?
<user1> Certainly .
<user1> Yes , millions of travelers come here every year for the view of the buildings .
<user0> The journey is worth while . Where are we going after this ?
<user1> We will visit the Statue of Liberty as scheduled .
<user1> Yes ?
<user0> Do you have any information about the city sights ?
<user1> Sure . There ' s a lot here in this pamphlet .
<user0> Thank you . And what ' s the best way to get downtown ?
<user1> Take the subway . It ' s $ 1.50 per ride . You can buy a petrol card at the station .
<user0> You ' Ve been very helpful .
<user1> My pleasure .
<user1> First , you fill out the application form and then we'll issue you a passbook .
<user0> Is there any minimum for the first deposit ?
<user1> No , Even a dollar is all right.Here ' s your passbook , sir ; just sign your name on it .
<user0> What is the annual interest rate ?
<user1> It varies from time to time.At present it is 6 % .
<user0> By the way , can I open a checking account too ?
<user1> By all means.But you have to deposit enough money before you can write out your checks .
<user1> Well , I had a blood test last week . The doctor said that I have high blood pressure and my blood is thick and sticky . I'm very worried .
<user0> Take it easy . When we last talked , you promised there would be more exercises in your life . But now you are putting on some weight .
<user1> I have to admit it's easier said than done .
<user0> Well , I think it's time for you to change your eating habits and develop a healthy lifestyle . Regular exercise will improve your health .
<user1> But you know I'm just not into exercises . And I wouldn't have time for exercises , either .
<user0> You can do some jogging . It's easy and it doesn't take much time .
<user1> Actually , my doctor said the same thing .
<user1> Oh . I am sorry . I was busy looking for some whisky.Can you tell me the exactly place where I can find any ?
<user0> Yes , it's on the third floor .
<user1> Do you have anything to declare ?
<user0> No , these are all my personal effects .
<user1> What's in the bag ? Would you mind opening the bag ?
<user0> Not at all . I don't know what's dutiable . Do I have to pay duty on things for my own use ?
<user1> NO . You don't have to pay duty on personal belongings .
<user0> Thank you .
<user1> Working under pressure is exciting and challenging . I don ' t mind working under pressure . I work well under that circumstance . People can , I can .
<user0> Do you have any particular conditions that you would like the company to take into consideration ?
<user1> No , nothing in particular .
<user0> How soon can you begin working for us ?
<user1> I need about two to three weeks for necessary formalities . I will quit then transfer to your company .
<user1> I think I have a piece of apple pie .
<user0> Do you want something to drink ?
<user1> Coffee would be fine .
<user0> OK . Sit down and I'll get it .
<user1> Hope it all goes well . We're very busy at the moment and certainly don't want any problems at this time of year .
<user0> Yes , I realise that . We've spent a long time planning and preparing for the change-over . I'm confident we won't have any major problems .
<user1> It wasn't me .
<user1> Could you tell me what Ants on the Tree is please ?
<user0> Certainly , Madam . It's a stir fried dish of minced pork with glass noodles .
<user1> Sounds nice . I'll have that please .
<user1> Hi Angie , it ' s Tom Reynolds here . Can you tell me if my tuition fees for this semester have been approved ?
<user0> Yes , Mr . Reynolds . They were approved yesterday . You can pick up the check today .
<user1> Oh wow ! Thanks a million , Angie !
<user1> Good morning , sir !
<user0> Good morning , please make yourself comfortable .
<user1> Thank you , sir .
<user0> Your name and examination number , please .
<user1> My name is Du Tao , number 3 .
<user0> Pardon ?
<user1> Du Tao . D-U for Du and T-A - 0 for Tao .
<user0> Yes , Mr . Du , when were you born ?
<user1> I was born on January 1st , 1988 . I ' m 20 years old now .
<user0> Where do you live ?
<user1> I ' m living at Room 222 , Building 18 , N . P . U .
<user0> Can you leave me your phone number ?
<user1> Gladly , 8962105 2 .
<user1> Yes . I'm looking for an apartment , I'd like two bedrooms .
<user0> All right . Have a seat , please . Let me ask you a few questions . First of all , may I have your name , please ?
<user1> My name's Donald Eakins .
<user0> How do you spell your last name , Mr.Eakins .
<user1> It's E-A-K-I-N-S .
<user0> E-A-K-I-N-S.First name , Donald . And what's your present address , Mr.Eakins ?
<user1> It's 1446 Pine Street .
<user0> 1446 Pine . That's in San Francisco , isn't it ?
<user1> Yes , it is .
<user1> Yes , I did . But when I got home , my son put it on and we found the hole .
<user0> Really ? Let me have a look at it . Mm . OK . Let me change it for another one .
<user1> Thank you very much .
<user1> All I need is your name , phone , and reservation date .
<user0> My name is Rudy Randolph . I'm at 818-555-1234 . The reservation was for April 9 .
<user1> Randolph , Rudy . Let me hit one button , sir , and now your reservation is cancelled .
<user0> Okay , thank you . I'll make another reservation as soon as I can .
<user1> It's been my pleasure to help you .
<user1> No , I didn't .
<user0> When are you going to go get it ?
<user1> I'm not sure where they sell bus passes at .
<user0> Why didn't you just ask me ?
<user1> Where should I go ?
<user0> You can get one from student services .
<user1> I had no clue that I could get it there .
<user0> I already knew that .
<user1> Thanks for letting me know .
<user0> You're welcome .
<user1> I'm going to go and get it right now .
<user1> Well , if you want to look professional , serious and more conservative , a blue dress , white shirt and not-too-high shoes would be the best choice . But sometimes , very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues . It depends on the company ' s dress code .
<user0> Indeed , I found most of the employees dress casually when I went to the interview . Only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony . It seems that their dress code is not that formal . Probably , I should put on car key and simple shirt .
<user1> Whatever you choose , make sure they are neat and clean .
<user1> Certainly , but will it take long ?
<user0> No , I'll be right back .
<user1> OK . I'll look after it then .
<user1> Yes , how do I get to your shop from Chilin ?
<user0> Go straight up Zhongshan Road and you will see our sign on your right , after you pass the museum .
<user1> Thank you very much .
<user1> How about two inches ?
<user0> That sounds perfect . Do you think I can get some highlights today , too ? I've always wanted red .
<user1> I think that will over-process your hair , you should wait at least two weeks .
<user0> All right . I'll just have the cut and perm today .
<user1> Great . My assistant will wash your hair , and then I'll be back to help you .
<user0> OK .
<user1> How can there be a traffic jam on a 16 - lane highway every day ?
<user0> There are just too many people , and too many cars .
<user1> I wonder if there was an accident .
<user0> No , they just said it too many people were trying to get off at the Capitol exits .
<user1> Well , let ' s put on some music . We ' re going to be stuck in this for a while .
<user0> All right , what do you want to listen to ?
<user1> How about some Beatles ?
<user0> Yeah , all right .
<user1> Yes , Ms . Rodriguez ? How can I help you ?
<user0> I wanted to see if I could arrange a meeting with you to discuss recruitment .
<user1> Absolutely . I ' Ve been wanting to meet with you about that . Let me just get my book .
<user1> I did , Mom .
<user0> Shame on you . I was saving them for your brother .
<user1> Sorry , you have the wrong number . There ' s no Brian here .
<user0> Is this 777-9345 ?
<user1> No , it ' s 777-9344 ?
<user0> Oh , I ' m so sorry .
<user1> That ' s OK .
<user1> Excuse me , ma'ma . Could you walk back through the doorway again , please ?
<user0> What for ?
<user1> Airport security . Could you empty your pockets over here , please ?
<user0> Really ? I'm in a hurry . All right .
<user1> Ah , a set of keys .
<user0> I'm embarrassed ! I forgot completely about them . I'm terribly sorry .
<user1> That's all right . Enjoy your flight .
<user0> Thank you .
<user1> I'm not feeling well . I think I'm having a cold .
<user0> Looks like it.You need to drink a lot of water and take a good rest .
<user1> Yeah , I will .
<user1> Oh , sorry . Cross my fingers .
<user1> Where are we going ?
<user0> Down to the basement .
<user1> Do you have a washer down there ?
<user0> Yes . We have a dryer , too .
<user1> That's so convenient . Where are the dirty clothes ?
<user0> They are in the basement already .
<user1> But I didn't see you carry them down .
<user0> Don't you know that we have a laundry chute in the house ?
<user1> Oh , hi , Mary , come on in . Any problem ?
<user0> Oh , no problem .
<user1> Great . I forgot to ask you , though . How long did you want the place ?
<user0> Six months .
<user1> Oh , well , that might be a problem . I usually only sign one year leases .
<user0> Well , one year would be fine , too . I ' m not planning on leaving the area anytime soon .
<user1> Well , if it ' s not a problem . Then here you go .
<user0> Just let me look at it quickly .
<user1> Of course .
<user0> Looks like a standard lease .
<user1> Yeah , and don ' t worry about the security deposit . If everything ' s all right when you move out , you ' ll get it back .
<user0> O . K . Great . Just sign and date it here ?
<user1> Yes . Thanks . You can move your stuff in tomorrow .
<user0> Wonderful .
<user1> Yes , the bookshop is just around the corner.Turn left and you ' ll see the bookshop .
<user0> Thank you very much.By the way , is the hospital beside the bookshop .
<user1> Right , if you see the bookshop , you can see the hospital .
<user0> Thank you for your help .
<user1> Not at all .
<user1> Yes . Who is speaking ?
<user0> This is Kelly speaking . I am calling from London . How are you , Mr . Chang ?
<user1> Oh , Kelly , I couldn't recognize your voice . Well , I'm fine .
<user0> Mr . Chang , I just want to tell you that we are leaving London for Beijing by flight CP 645 on Saturday morning . Could you meet us at the airport , please ?
<user1> Excuse me , I couldn't quite hear you . This line is crossed . Can you speak louder , please ?
<user0> I will say it again ... Do you hear me now ?
<user1> Much better . I will definitely go to the airport to meet you .
<user0> Thank you very much . Goodbye .
<user1> Goodbye .
<user1> Yes . Everything's all set .
<user0> I'd like to bring Mr . Huang and Ms . Sun with me .
<user1> We're supposed to be meeting alone .
<user0> I know , but I think they may add something valuable to the discussion .
<user1> Fine . But no one else , OK ?
<user0> Yes , Mr . Hammer .
<user1> Really , it's so beautiful .
<user0> You like it . Well , I'll gather in for you .
<user1> You mustn't pick it in this place .
<user0> Where it is ?
<user1> It's a private garden .
<user1> 110 pounds .
<user0> Really ? Congratulations ! That's really something beyond my imagination . How did you make it ? Did you keep on a diet ?
<user1> No , you know I can't bear eating less .
<user0> Then do the slim pills take effect on you ?
<user1> I've quit it already . I go to aerobics class everyday instead .
<user0> How's it going on ?
<user1> You see . I've lost my weight in spite of my good appetite .
<user0> I'd better exercise my body too . My limbs are rusty now .
<user1> I don't think so . You look full of energy every day . Time has stood still with you .
<user0> Thank you .
<user1> What happened to you ? You look like you got hit by a tornado !
<user0> I just got back from fighting the crowds .
<user1> You mean at the mall ? Was there a sale ?
<user0> Yeah . For five minutes , everything was half off . It was total chaos ...
<user1> Cool !
<user0> Grabbing , pushing and shoving ...
<user1> Hello , Mr . Henderson what can I do for you ?
<user0> I need this dress and this suit dry cleaned ASAP !
<user1> OK , I can have it ready by the end of the week .
<user0> No , you don ' t understand , I need this tomorrow morning ! I accidentally spilled beer all over my wife ' s dress and we have a wedding to attend tomorrow ! She ' s gonna kill me !
<user1> OK , I can have it ready tomorrow afternoon , but this suit is also very stained . I can ' t guarantee we can remove it completely .
<user0> Fine ! Can you also iron and starch this shirt ?
<user1> Certainly .
<user0> Great ! This is our secret ! If you see my wife , say nothing to her about this !
<user1> Every five minutes .
<user0> Oh , here comes a bus !
<user1> It comes on the dot .
<user1> Thanks . It ' s nothing special actually .
<user0> Don ' t say that . It owes to your efforts and team spirit .
<user1> Oh , it was nothing . Anyone could have done it . I still have a lot to learn yet .
<user0> You are very modest . Best luck in your new position .
<user1> Thank you . I won ' t let this promotion change me .
<user1> Calm down , sir . What's your name and where are you now ?
<user0> My name is Jerry and we are on the intersection of West Road and East Road .
<user1> Sir , leave the house if the fire draws any closer to your house . Our men will be over in 5 minutes .
<user1> Of course ! It is the No . 1 stressor in my life . You know job stress has become a very common problem these days . So we must learn to cope with it .
<user0> Totally agree . What is your solution ?
<user1> Well , there are two causes of job stress . One is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . So if we want to manage job stress , both we and the companies should do something . For me , I am trying to balance work and leisure time . You know , all work and no play make Jack a dull boy .
<user0> You seem to have a very relaxed outlook .
<user1> It is necessary . Positive attitude helps to prevent stress .
<user0> But I don ' t think we can change our working condition . Anyway , we are not the bosses .
<user1> I heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them , like avoiding unrealistic deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . Our boss is a smart person . He will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team .
<user1> Yes , what can I do for you ?
<user0> I'd like to send this parcel , please .
<user1> What's in it , please ?
<user0> Some books and newspapers .
<user1> OK . please fill in this form and label it .
<user0> Is it all right ?
<user1> Yeah . And would you like to mail it by air ?
<user0> No , I'd rather send it by sea .
<user1> Thirteen yuan , please . Here is the receipt and change .
<user0> Thank you .
<user1> You are welcome .
<user1> Oh right ... you know , my friend Eric is a DJ . Maybe he would like to play with us .
<user0> Hmm ... does he have a good ear for hip hop music ?
<user1> Well , I don't know , but we can find out . We can talk to him and ask if he wants to join our group .
<user1> Yes . When do you want it ?
<user0> Next Today . By the way , is there a closed circuit TV ?
<user1> Yes , sir .
<user0> What about laundry ?
<user1> Sorry , sir . You have to pay by yourself .
<user1> I'm not sure , but I think It's open until 4 o'clock .
<user0> What time is it now ?
<user1> It's a quarter past three .
<user1> There are many stores selling handcrafts in Paris . Our store is wellknown for vase , table wear and jewelry boxes . You can take your time and choose whatever you like .
<user0> Well , the tapestry is delicate and beautiful .
<user1> You have made an excellent choice , it is our newcomer . The tapestry is on hot sell with the design and quality . The design on it is traditional Paris architecture .
<user0> How much is it ?
<user1> 100 frances .
<user0> Mmm , it is reasonable . Look at this set of table wear , it is so beautiful !
<user1> We have a piece of table clothing to go with it . It is a brocade one with pretty stars .
<user0> This silver vase is a good ornament for the living room .
<user1> You are right .
<user0> I will take the tapestry , the set of table wear and the vase .
<user1> OK . Do you like these candles ? They are on sale now .
<user0> All right . I will take one .
<user1> Don't you like it ?
<user0> I don't . Is there anything worth watching on the other channel ?
<user1> I think it's a basketball match on channel 5 .
<user0> Do you mind if we switch over ?
<user1> Well , I'd rather see a movie .
<user0> What's the movie ?
<user1> ' Star war ' .
<user0> It must be interesting .
<user1> Yes , you're right .
<user1> Are you from a domestic flight or an international one ?
<user0> An international one from Seattle .
<user1> In that case , you should go to the baggage hall over there .
<user0> Oh yes , I see the sign , thank you .
<user1> Yeah , that was close .
<user1> Yes ?
<user0> Could you tell me where the copy room is ?
<user1> Sure . You just walk down this hallway . The copy room is the second room on the right .
<user1> What symptoms does he have ?
<user0> He has had a fever for one day . Just now at home , he had febrile convulsions with teeth and fists clenched and eyes turned up . We were at a loss what to do . We called an ambulance and brought the baby here .
<user1> How long did the convulsion last ?
<user0> About 3 minutes .
<user1> Does he have any other complaints ?
<user0> Three days ago , he began to cough , sneeze and have a running nose . Yesterday , he began to have a fever .
<user1> Have you taken his temperature ?
<user0> It was 38 ° C this morning and it was 39 ° C just now .
<user1> Let me examine him to see if there is any rash . No rash .
<user0> Is it serious ? Is it meningitis ?
<user1> No , it is not meningitis . Just a high fever and convulsions , which results from a virus upper respiratory tract inflection .
<user0> Does he have to be admitted to hospital ?
<user1> No . No need for admission . I'll give the baby analgia nose drops to bring down the temperature first . Then I will give you a prescription . The pink tablets are used for his fever . When his temperature is over 38 ° C , give him one tablet . The other tablets are sedatives for his convulsions . The white liquid is for the cold . Give the baby plenty of water to drink .
<user0> Thank you very much , doctor .
<user1> Sure . I thought people only showed off pictures of their new babies , not new pets !
<user0> Well , this is my new baby . He ' s just as much trouble . That ' s for sure ! But , he ' s a lot of fun !
<user1> I see what you mean . He ' s really cute . How old is he ?
<user1> Ok , let ' s start opening some presents !
<user0> Oh look ! What a great little bib for the baby ! This will definitely come in handy ! Oh wow , you also got me a stroller ! That ' s so great ! Thank you !
<user1> This next one is from Betty .
<user0> A highchair and car seat ! Wow Betty , thank you so much ! I really appreciate it !
<user1> One more from Carla .
<user0> A playpen and crib ! Thanks Carla ! This is just what I needed !
<user1> OK , that ' s all of them . No more gifts . Now who wants to guess when the baby is due ?
<user0> Umm . I think my water just broke ! Get me to a hospital !
<user1> I always love skiing . You know , it's a cool game for cool people . Stay with me and you will be cool , too .
<user0> Hey , look over there . It seems that there is something interesting going on . Let's go and have a look .
<user1> Sure . It's probably the skiing show . Adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
<user0> See that . It's so dangerous . My mom would never allow me to do that .
<user1> Hey , don't be so pathetic . It's a maximal sports show . What else can they do to attract more visitors ? Stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
<user0> You are right . But what if the avalanche happened ?
<user1> They are all very experienced and great skiers . So I suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
<user0> Anyway , the show is breathtaking . By the way , where did they get so much snow in here ?
<user1> Don't you know that ? Are you kidding me ?
<user0> Hey , not everyone is as lucky as you to have a father who is a scientist .
<user1> Sorry . Well , they have the most advanced snowmaking machine .
<user0> Do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
<user1> It's possible . But the boss here said they were doing whatever they can .
<user0> It's a good thing . OK , let's go skiing .
<user1> Here we go .
<user1> Non-smoking , please .
<user1> Yes . My wife and I are interested in renting a house for the summer .
<user0> Do you want a furnished house or an unfurnished one ?
<user1> Furnished .
<user0> Very well . How long do you want the house ? All summer ?
<user1> No , not all summer . Just for six weeks .
<user0> I'm afraid I can only rent it for two months .
<user1> My holiday is only six weeks , but I think my brother and his family would take it for the other two weeks.Is the house in good condition ?
<user0> Yes , it is . It was just painted and it has all the modern conveniences .
<user1> Yes , unlikely my flight will be 2 hours due to the fog . Would you please keep my reservation ?
<user0> Sure . May I have your name please ?
<user1> Lincoln . That's L-I-N-C-O-L-N . Thank you .
<user1> That's good to hear . You've had an ideal recovery from your operation . We're going to send you home tomorrow .
<user0> Do you think I can get back to work very soon ?
<user1> Don't be in such a hurry . I'm confident that you'll be completely recovered in 4 to 6 weeks .
<user0> Is there anything I should do ?
<user1> You'd better have a good rest for a week . Be sure to have regular meals . Stay away from alcohol.Give up smoking at least a little while .
<user0> Should I take some medicine ?
<user1> Yes . I'm going to give you some.Take one tablet of this medicine three times a day before meals . For that one , two tablets . And remember to come to the out patient department for a consultation in two weeks , please .
<user0> It's very kind of you .
<user1> You're welcome . We wish you a speedy recovery.Goodbye .
<user1> Please show me the menu again .
<user0> Here you are . sir , the chocolate cake is very delicious .
<user1> No , thanks . I don't like chocolate . I'd like strawberry pie .
<user0> I am afraid there is none .
<user1> Then I'll have vanilla ice cream .
<user0> Fine . I will bring it right away .
<user1> Yes , hello , I would like to make a reservation please .
<user0> Certainly sir , For which day and time please ?
<user1> Tonight at seven .

<user1> In that case , eight o'clock is fine .
<user0> Very well , and how many people will attend tonight ?
<user1> Four people .
<user0> Lastly , may I please know what name I should make the reservation under ?
<user1> Mark .
<user1> Yes , Sir .
<user0> These two are urgent letters and should be sent by registered express airmail . Others are ordinary letters .
<user1> All right , who should I send them to ?
<user0> It ' s sent to Mr . Charles . I believe he is in London .
<user1> Ok , home or office address ?
<user0> Office address , please . He might be at work when they arrive .
<user1> Should I enclose this commercial paper with these two letters ?
<user0> Yes , it ' s right .
<user1> Thanks , doctor . Is there anything I can take for this headache ?
<user0> Some aspirin or Panadol should help . You can pick some up at the pharmacy when you go to fill your prescription .

<user0> Goodbye , Randy . Take care .

<user0> May I ask what time he will come back ?
<user1> I think he will come back at 3 p . m . Do you want to call later ? Or would you like to leave a message for him ?
<user0> I'd like to leave a message . Please ask him to call me back as soon as he returns . I'm A and he has my number .
<user1> OK . I will do that .
<user0> Thank you very much . Bye .
<user1> You're welcome . Bye .
<user1> Yes sir , just a minute , please . I ' ll check with the kitchen . Thank you for waiting . It takes another 10 to 15 minutes , I ' m afraid .
<user0> I have an appointment in half an hour .
<user1> I see .
<user0> Do you have anything else I can have instead ?
<user1> Well sir , yes . How about this stew ? We can serve you at once .
<user0> I ' ll take this stew then .
<user1> No , tell him I'm tied up .

<user1> Thank you .
<user1> As you know , we are in a very special time . This is a very hard time for many countries ' economics , both developed and developing . I think the current economic situation could be described as synchronized slowdown of major economies .
<user0> What is the direct impact of the terrorist attack upon your country's economy ?
<user1> Once the US economy is in trouble due to the terrorist attack , the impact could be quickly felt in the rest of the world .
<user0> What challenges is your country's economy facing at the moment ?
<user1> We do face a lot of challenges because there is still much uncertainty about the world economy . It's very important for us to strike a proper balance between investment in fixed assets and household consumption .
<user1> There is a Matisse exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art . Larry and I will go .
<user0> Did you buy tickets already ?
<user1> No . Do we need tickets ?
<user0> Well , probably . Probably you will have to wait in line if you don't have tickets .
<user1> Outside or inside ?
<user0> Outside , on the sidewalk .
<user1> Hmm . It's very cold today.But I brought my jacket . Maybe it will be alright to wait .
<user0> The MYOMA is very popular . There will be a lot of people .
<user1> MYOMA ? What's that ?
<user0> Oh , sorry.It stands for the Museum of Modern Art . It's an acronym . M O M A MYOMA .
<user1> I see . Do you have any suggestions for other things we should do ?
<user0> I suggest you go to the Jewish Museum.It ' s not far from the Guggenheim , near Central Park . It is really very interesting.Also , there is a great museum of medieval European art further up north.It ' s called the Cloisters .
<user1> How can we get up there ?
<user0> You can take a bus .
<user1> But Larry says the neighborhoods in the north are dangerous .
<user1> Yes , what about us having a tour ?
<user0> Good idea . Where shall we go ?
<user1> How about Milan ?
<user0> Great . Shall we go alone or as part of the group ?
<user1> Why not travel by ourselves ?
<user1> Yes . I need some ice water delivered .

<user0> Everything appears to be in order . Thank you for your time .
<user1> I have been coming here for the past few years .
<user0> Why do you wash here ?
<user1> It's actually a lot cheaper for me to wash my clothes here .
<user0> I've only washed my clothes here a couple times .
<user1> Why don't you wash clothes at home ?
<user0> I would , if my washing machine wasn't broken .
<user1> Why don't you just get it fixed ?
<user0> I can't afford it .
<user1> So you plan on washing your clothes here from now on ?
<user0> That's my only option right now .
<user1> Don't worry . Besides , it's a lot cheaper to wash clothes this way .
<user1> I am so happy to know that I could make some contribution to our company .
<user0> This title does not only give you a raising pay-check , but also increase responsibilities . Congratulations , and hope the best for you .
<user1> Thank you , I will be doing my best .
<user1> That's not a problem . Leave it with me , and find something that you like .
<user0> I was hoping you'd have something on sale today .
<user1> We have nothing on sale today . But we're having a big sale next weekend .
<user0> Is the sale going to include dresses ?
<user1> Everything you can see will be on sale .
<user0> I like the sound of that . I'll just come back next weekend .
<user1> The savings will be worth the short wait . See you next weekend .
<user1> Well . I can't find my key now . I think I have lost it .
<user0> Really ? Have you left it in your room ?
<user1> I don't think so . I took it with me when I went out this morning .

<user1> I want to transfer money from my savings account .
<user0> Where do you want the money to go to ?
<user1> I want the money to be transferred into my checking account .
<user0> How much money are you going to transfer today ?
<user1> $ 200 will be fine .
<user0> Is that all I can do for you today ?
<user1> I won ' t be needing anything else .
<user1> Yes . What is the rent ?
<user0> $ 300 per month .

<user0> When is a good time to catch him ?
<user1> In about twenty minutes .
<user1> Which book ? This one ?
<user0> No , not that one . The red one .
<user1> This one ?
<user0> Yes , please .
<user1> Here you are .
<user0> Thank you .
<user1> Yes .
<user0> What brand do you prefer ?
<user1> An ordinary one will do.Would you put me under a hot dryer after that ? I'm in a hurry .
<user0> All right , miss.This one is very hot . I'll come to turn it off in fifteen minutes.Will that be alright ?
<user1> OK .
<user1> It ' s true . You should be happy about that .
<user1> It seems not or somebody has recently received a large fax .
<user0> Ok , no problem . We do it ourselves .
<user1> Do you know how to do it ? I am not so good at machine things . I will have somebody do it as soon as possible .
<user0> Check with somebody from the IT department . They are anyway in charge of the office electronic equipment .
<user1> An understanding of the basic workings of a company and the services or goods it provides is essential . Do you have that ?
<user0> Sort of , but I could know more , I guess .
<user1> With that understanding , you can figure out what your company is looking for in terms of basic attitude . Right ?
<user0> I think that they are a very formal company .
<user1> What you wear is important . So keep in mind what is suitable for the company and type of work you will be doing . Need help ?
<user0> I need a lot of help in this area .
<user1> In addition to clothes we need to think about other basics , OK ?
<user0> Yes , what else should we think of ?
<user1> Be prompt . Don't forget to be friendly and interested . Listen carefully and listen to what they are really asking you . You'll be a hit !
<user1> I did only simple things in the office , such as tidying up the office , serving tea , typing and filing , and so on .

<user1> I'm off to Barcelona for a week .
<user0> Do you have your passport with you ?
<user1> Yes , here you go . I don't need a visa to go to Spain , do I ?
<user0> Fortunately for you , you don't . Next time , if you have any questions about visas , you should try to find out before you get to the airport .
<user1> That's good advice .
<user0> Would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?
<user1> Are there any seats available by the emergency exits ?
<user0> Let me see here ... yes , there's one left .
<user1> Ok . I'll take that one then .
<user0> Alright . How many pieces of luggage are you checking in ?
<user1> I like to travel light so I just have this one .
<user0> If that's your only piece of luggage , it is small enough to carry on with you . Would you like to do that so you don't have to wait in luggage reclaim once you arrive ?
<user1> Yes , please . That's a fantastic idea . Which gate do I need to go to ?
<user0> You're here a bit early , so check the departure screens in the waiting area in about a half hour . Here's your boarding pass . Enjoy your flight !
<user1> Well , we could probably get started with a strategy meeting tomorrow morning at 8
<user0> I tell you what , 800 is no good for me , but why don ' t you guys get started and I ' ll come by at around 8
<user1> That ' s fine with me . How much time are we going to have to work on this ?
<user1> Okay . Do you have a particular size in mind ?
<user0> Well , the bigger the better , I think .
<user1> Look at this one . It's our biggest pan .
<user0> Yes , that is big enough , but it's too heavy for me .
<user1> Okay , we have the same thing in aluminum .
<user0> Oh , this is nice and light . But it has an aluminum handle .
<user1> Try this one . Same aluminum pan , but with a heat-resistant bamboo handle .
<user0> Oh , yes . This is very nice . I'll take this one .
<user1> That's a good choice . How do you want to pay for it ?
<user0> Cash . Oh , I almost forgot . I need a lid , too .
<user1> I'm so sorry . A lid comes with the pan . Here it is .
<user1> Yes . Is there anything you can give me to get rid of it , Doctor ?
<user0> I ' m going to prescribe some antibiotics , and some cream to ease the itching and burning .
<user1> OK . Thank you . Where should I buy them ?
<user0> The pharmacy will give you a discount since you came to the clinic .
<user1> Great . What floor is the pharmacy on ?
<user0> The fourth . I ' ll send the prescription down there , so you can just pick it up on your way out .
<user1> Thank you .
<user1> We'd like to visit the factory . Can you show me the way ?
<user0> That's OK ! We'll take you to have a tour . Please follow me .
<user1> How many shifts are there in your factory ?
<user0> There are two shifts now in total .
<user1> What about your company's QC management ?
<user0> We established the strict QC standards and we have followed it for about five years with good results .
<user1> Where are the workers from ? From the villages nearby ?
<user0> Most of them live in the city . We provide free commuter buses for the workers . Besides , we built the dormitory building for the workers on night shift .
<user1> It sounds nice . We can't wait to visiting the factory .
<user1> Open your mouth , please . Which one ?
<user0> The one right at the back .
<user1> I'm afraid we can ' t save that one . It will have to come out .
<user0> Will it hurt much ?
<user1> I'll give you an injection , then you won't feel pain .
<user0> ( 5 minutes later ) OK , it's all over . Spit there and bite the cotton ball tightly in place for half an hour .
<user1> We have to find a shelter .
<user0> All right .
<user1> Let's go under the tree .
<user0> No , we can't . It's thundering .
<user1> Then let's go to that store .
<user1> One second , sir , while I print out your receipt . Here you are .
<user0> Thanks .
<user1> May I ask , sir , if you enjoyed your stay ?
<user0> Well , except for one night , I enjoyed the hotel . And I loved New York , of course .
<user1> Thank you for your honesty . I assure you there will be no cockroaches next time .
<user1> I attended school today . Did you ?
<user0> I wasn't able to attend school because I was feeling ill .
<user1> I'm sorry to hear that . Would you like the assignments from English class ?
<user0> I would really appreciate that , thanks .
<user1> It's no trouble at all .
<user0> If you get sick , I'll return the favor .
<user1> Thanks . See you at school tomorrow if you feel better .
<user1> Thank you , Mr . Owens , for taking time out of your busy schedule to interview me .
<user0> You ' re welcome . I appreciate your coming .
<user1> When can I contact you about your final decision ?
<user0> We need to consider several other applicants and we hope to make a decision by the end of this month . We will call you regardless of whether you are hired or not .
<user1> Thanks a lot ! I will look forward to the good news . Please call me at this number between nine and eleven in the morning .
<user0> Well , I really appreciate your coming today .
<user1> The pleasure is mine . It ' s nice talking with you . Good-bye , Mr . Owens .
<user0> Good-bye .
<user1> Are you having a meeting ?
<user0> Yes , and I don't want to be interrupted .
<user1> I understand .
<user1> Yes . Is there anything you can give me to get rid of it , doctor ?
<user0> I'm going to prescribe some antibiotics and some cream to ease the itching and burning .
<user1> Ok , thank you ! Where should I buy them ?
<user0> The pharmacy will give you a discount since you came to the clinic .
<user1> Great ! What floor is pharmacy on ?
<user0> The fourth . I'll send the prescription down there so you can just pick it up on your way out .
<user1> Thank you !
<user1> well , I'm looking for some summer clothes .
<user0> Oh , it is the right time for you purchasing in our clothes shop . We are now having a low price on all our summer apparel .
<user1> Really ? What's that ?
<user0> Everything for summer is 20 % off .
<user1> I like this T-shirt . Would you like to help me look for any skirts that go with it ?
<user0> Sure . We have both skirts and trousers that would look well with the T-shirt . Look at this section .
<user1> This one is good .
<user0> You have good taste . It is very much in style this year .
<user1> I'll take this one . How much are they ?
<user0> 160 yuan .
<user1> Here you are .
<user1> I got a sandwich , some chips , and a soda .
<user0> Did you bring that from home ?
<user1> I got it from the cafeteria .
<user0> What kind of sandwich did you get ?
<user1> They messed up my order and gave me a bologna sandwich .
<user0> How was it ?
<user1> Considering it wasn't what I ordered , it was still pretty good .
<user0> I think I got a sandwich there once before .
<user1> Really ?
<user0> Yes , and they didn't get my order right either .
<user1> As I have some administrative experience from my last job , I may use my organizational and planning skills in the future .
<user0> How do you plan to accomplish this ?
<user1> By doing everything necessary and for further study .
<user0> How long would you like to stay with this company ?
<user1> How long I will stay with the company depends on whether the company and I are satisfied with each other .

<user0> Bye .
<user1> I got stuck in a traffic jam .
<user0> Hurry up , the show is about to start .
<user1> It looks like you're very interested in the circus .
<user0> Yes , I love to see the animal show .
<user1> I have never seen those before , but since you're so excited it should be good .
<user0> I'm sure you'll love it .
<user1> Okay , I will go and get some popcorn first .
<user1> Help yourself .
<user1> Checking out , please .
<user0> Can I have your keys , please ? Thank you . Here's your statement .
<user1> Excuse me . What are these charges ?
<user0> Oh , these are the phone charges and these are for something from the bar .
<user1> Wait a minute . I made a phone call , but I never made a connection .
<user0> I know , sir . Those aren't telephone company charges . Those are hotel charges .
<user1> Isn't that a bit excessive ?
<user0> I'm sorry , sir . It's our policy .
<user1> OK . Here is the money .
<user0> Thank you . Welcome to our hotel again .
<user1> Yes , I'd like to look at some suits .
<user0> Oh , this way please . What size do you wear ?
<user1> Size 41 . I want something in dark flannel .
<user0> How about this one ?
<user1> It feels all right . But if it were a darker color , I'd like it better . This seems too light for winter . Do you think you could get me one ?
<user0> All right . I'll show you something darker . Do you like this one ?
<user1> It looks good . But can I try it on ?
<user0> Of course . Let me help you .

<user1> Thanks , Mr . Liang .
<user0> Among all the assistants , I think you're on top of it . Based on the annual evaluation , the board of directors decided to give you a bonus .
<user1> Really ? I am too happy .
<user0> I've been reviewing your work over the past few months . Thanks to your excellent work , we benefit much from your project . And you should get the perfect attendance award too .

<user1> Thank you very much . I will redouble my efforts in the future .
<user1> Thank you . Jack , it's always a pleasure doing business with you .
<user0> So how are things in the land of the free and the home of brave ?
<user1> Great ! And , how are things in your neck of the woods ?
<user0> Things are so great here . I almost smiled myself to death last week . One of my coworkers had to give me CPR .
<user1> Oh.Jack , I have missed your sense of humor.Ha ha ha ! Nobody else sees things quite like you do.It ' s your gift .
<user0> Or a curse .
<user1> Nope , it's a gift.Anyway , we need some more of those mid-range speakers you tricked me into buying last time .
<user0> That , my dear , was classic sales technique delivered by a professional .
<user1> Are you still gouging your customers the same price per unit ?
<user0> Heck no , we doubled the price , but because it's you , I'll let you have'em at 50 off .
<user1> You silver-tongued devil . Can't you ever just answer a question with a simple yes or no ?
<user0> I could , but where's the fun in that ?
<user1> So far it looks like we will be leaving two hours late , but keep checking the departing flights status board just in case .
<user0> Do you think it ' s safe to leave to get a quick bite ?
<user1> I think you should stay in the airport . Even though the delay is expected to be two hours , the flight departure could be announced any minute . Who knows ?
<user0> What seems to be the problem ?
<user1> It seems there are some loose bolts on one of the wings . It happens all the time . No need to worry .
<user0> Umm ... You know ... Actually I was thinking of trying another airline . No need to hold my seat .
<user1> So , why don ' t you ?
<user0> I have no idea how to use the ATM .
<user1> What do you mean ?
<user0> This will be my first time using an ATM .
<user1> I can help you with that .
<user0> Explain to me how to use it .
<user1> Just put your card into the machine .
<user0> Now what do I do ?
<user1> Then you need to type in your PIN .
<user0> Now what ?
<user1> Just click on one of the choices they give you , and that ' s it .
<user1> Yes please . Do you have any teas ?
<user0> Of course we have lots of teas ?
<user1> What do you recommend ?
<user0> What about a green tea or perhaps a jasmine tea ?
<user1> What ' s this one ?
<user0> That ' s Oolong tea – it ' s a Cantonese tea .
<user1> Ok , I ' ll try that .
<user1> Yes . Look at these historical relics here , amazing !
<user0> Why are they all in glass boxes ?
<user1> For protection . Some relics will turn to dust if exposed to air .
<user0> So there isn't air in the glass boxes ?
<user1> No , there isn't . They are all vacuumed .
<user0> I wonder how old these things are , thousands of years ?
<user1> Yeah , they all come from a very ancient time .
<user0> Hey , look at the three-leg cup . I've seen it on TV .
<user1> The bronze cup was made 4,000 years ago . It's priceless !
<user0> Yeah , it has no value at all . Who will use this cup today ?
<user1> Danny , priceless means so valuable that you can't put a price on it .
<user0> Oh , it does ?
<user1> I have confidence in you . Believe in yourself .
<user1> We want one vegetarian supreme and one double pepperoni .
<user0> Would you like anything to drink with that ? For $ 1.50 , you can get a two-liter bottle of Coke .
<user1> No , thanks .
<user0> All right . That'll be $ 12.50 . Your pizzas will be there in 30 minutes .
<user1> Thanks .
<user1> Well , I'll be glad to help you out . We can deliver what you need to your office .
<user0> Shall we meet at 1:15 this Thursday ? We definitely need some new filing cabinets and at least one desk unit .
<user1> Fine , I'll bring both our office furniture and equipment catalogs on Thursday .
<user1> Sure , turn left at the next crossing .
<user0> Is it on Xinhua street ?
<user1> Yes . You can't miss it .
<user1> I ' m looking for a hotel near the convention center .
<user0> You ' re in luck ! We ' re just a two-minute drive from there . Would you like to make a reservation ?
<user1> Not just yet . I have one or two questions . How much for a single ?
<user0> During the peak season , a single room goes for 50 dollars on a night . But we ' Ve got a Single Super Saver Special going on right now – only $ 30 a night . And we ' Ve also extended our checkout time 00 in
<user1> That ' s a good deal . Since this is a working trip , I wonder if you have meeting rooms where I can get together with some clients .
<user0> Yes , we have five meeting rooms , of various sizes . We can accommodate large meetings and small , informal gatherings as well . Of course , if you have many small meeting , you might consider checking
<user1> That sounds great . Do you accept checks ?
<user0> I ' m sorry , sir , we don ' t . But we do accept all major credit cards .
<user1> Oh , is there ? Which room is it ?
<user0> It's . I think , neighbours on the right .
<user1> You mean the room thirteen-thirteen ?
<user0> I'm not sure , but I think so . I'm very exhausted , but I can't sleep .
<user1> All right , ma'am . I'll check and tell them to be quiet .
<user0> If next room is still noisy , could you give me a different room , please ?
<user1> Yes , I ' Ve been there several times on business trips . But I have never really seen the terra-cotta warriors as it is outside the city .
<user0> I ' Ve heard many people saying that it is a place worth touring . I really want to see the old walls and terra-cotta warriors one day . Of course I won ' t miss the local food either . You know , the sites interests a food in scenery , food is a key factor when visiting a place .
<user1> I agree . As long as the food is not too bizarre once I saw some people eating insects . That is frightening .
<user0> Sure it is . Is it convenient to get there by plane ?
<user1> Well , the airport is quite far from the downtown area , but it is still more convenient than taking the train .
<user1> A cheap day return ticket ?
<user0> Yes , including London Tube .
<user1> That'll be twelve pounds .
<user1> Having a good diet is probably the most important thing .
<user0> It is very confusing to know what to eat .
<user1> You need plenty of fruits and vegetables , small amounts of protein , and whole grains .
<user0> Are there certain things that I should avoid ?
<user1> You shouldn ' t consume too much sugar or caffeine . Also , watch your intake of fatty food .
<user0> After watching my diet , what else should I do ?
<user1> You need to stop smoking , and make sure that you get 30 minutes of exercise every day .
<user0> Can I have a glass of wine now and then ?
<user1> As long as you don ' t overdo it , a glass of wine a day should be OK .
<user1> I am washing clothes . Are you hungry now ? Wait for a moment , I'll cook dinner for you . ( Steven bends his brows )
<user0> B , should we get a maid ?
<user1> I can do all the housework . We don't need a maid .
<user0> You have worked very hard in the office . If we can get someone to help you , you can have more rest .
<user1> We really don't need to .
<user0> You are a good wife , Julia . But you must take care of yourself .
<user1> Give me some time to think about it .
<user1> Certainly . How do you like your room ?
<user0> I'd like a suite . What's the rate ?
<user1> $ 40 per night .
<user1> Excuse me , can I change my order ? I am afraid I don't have so much time to enjoy my dinner .
<user0> I am sorry , sir . Your fish will be ready in five minutes so you can't change it .
<user1> That's all right .
<user1> Yes . I graduated this past June .
<user0> Which university did you graduate from ?
<user1> Guangzhou University .
<user0> What degree did you receive ?
<user1> I received a bachelor's degree in Economics .
<user0> What courses did you take in college ?
<user1> My major courses were Microeconomics , Macroeconomics , International Trade , International Finance , World Economy , Psychology and Business English
<user0> Why did you choose to study Economics ?
<user1> Because I was quite interested in Economics then .
<user0> Can you speak other languages except English ?
<user1> I can also speak a little Japanese .
<user0> I am very satisfied with your answers .
<user1> Thank you very much .
<user1> OK , don ' t worry about it . I will .
<user0> Take care of yourself .
<user1> Okay , Bob , when will I see you ?
<user0> Maybe I will be around later .
<user1> Okay , I'll see you later .
<user1> Well , sir . May I have your room number ?
<user0> 503 . I would like to pay for it .
<user1> Please fill out the form first .
<user0> OK , can you bring me a new one ?
<user1> Of course .
<user1> It says on the bottle here that you can have two refills .
<user0> Yes , I need to refill it today .
<user1> Alright . I'm sorry , Miss . According to our file , this prescription has already been refilled twice .
<user0> I was worried about that . I couldn't remember if I had it refilled twice yet or not .
<user1> Well , it looks like you have.You will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
<user0> Listen . This is an emergency . I tried to call my doctor , but he is out of town . So I can't see him in time . I need this medicine . It is for skin condition . I've run out.Can you just refill it once more ?
<user1> I'm sorry , Miss . We can't do it . We must follow the prescription.And this prescription has run out .
<user0> But I need it . Please . Refill it for me just this once . I can go to the doctor around ten days from now . Then I'll have another prescription .
<user1> Miss , I understand your problem.But it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription.It ' s the law . I can't do anything about it.We never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . Never .
<user0> But I have a prescription . I just need more of it .
<user1> A prescription must be valid . It cannot be an expired prescription . I'm sorry , Miss . It's the law.You will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
<user0> Oh , it will be so expensive ! I have a special medical plan , and I can only see one doctor.It will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
<user1> Miss , I just can't help you on this . I'm a pharmacist , not a doctor . And there are other customers I need to help now . I know it is frustrating when this happens.But there is nothing I can do about it . I'm sorry .
<user0> This is ridiculous ! In Taiwan , it is much easier to get medicine when I need it .
<user1> Maybe that's true . I don't know.But I'm sure in Taiwan you have prescriptions too .
<user1> I ' m trying to put the vase on the shelf .
<user0> Let regive you a hand .
<user1> No , thank you . I can manage it , I think .
<user1> Look at this one . It has a radio and cassette player and built in speakers .
<user0> I'd rather get one with separated speakers.They give a clear sound .
<user1> Yes , but we shouldn't get any thing too big . Remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
<user0> That's right . Now this one looks alright ? It's a detached or do you prefer this one ? It's Sony .
<user1> Let's ask the salesmen for a demonstration .
<user1> You've been sneezing a lot lately . Are you sick or something ?
<user0> No . Every spring time around April , I'm stricken with allergies .
<user1> I never have seasonal allergies .
<user0> Consider yourself lucky .
<user1> What are all the symptoms ?
<user0> Well , as you just saw , I sneeze a lot . Also , my nose becomes very runny , my throat sometimes itches , and my eyes start to water .
<user1> That doesn't sound good .
<user0> No , it's not . So you don't have any type of allergies ?
<user1> Well , I have a severe allergic reaction to alcohol . It runs in the family .
<user0> Everyone to some extent is allergic to alcohol .
<user1> I get it pretty bad . My whole face turns red , including my ears . My eyes become bloodshot , and I start to itch all over my body .
<user0> That's pretty bad .
<user1> But that doesn't stop me from drinking . Ahahah .
<user1> All right . Wukesong stop is quite a few stops from here .
<user0> Let's buy some tickets .
<user1> The train is coming . There are a lot of people waiting here . let's stand in a better position to get on the train
<user0> Well , it's not as crowded as we expected , is it ?
<user1> No , but it will be soon . Look , there're two empty seats over there . Let's get them .
<user1> I'm an apprentice with a local engineering firm . My training lasts for two years . Two days a week I study Engineering at a local college . If I pass all my exams , I hope the company will take me on as an engineer .
<user1> Dogs are nice , but they are really energetic , and you need to make sure they get enough exercise every day .
<user0> Having a dog would probably be too much work for me , then .
<user1> What about cats ? They are more independent .
<user0> Actually , I was thinking of something a little more exotic . I don't want a common pet like a dog or a cat .
<user1> How about a lizard ? Are lizards more along the lines of what you were thinking of getting ?
<user0> Yeah , are they easy to look after ?
<user1> Yeah , they are pretty low-maintenance ; they eat almost anything .
<user1> I've been told that Chinese arts and crafts are famous for their excellent workmanship . We'd like to take some home . What would you recommend ?
<user0> There are over a thousands kinds of articles in our shop.For example , there is tricolored pottery originating in the Tang Dynasty , embroidery , batik , jade carving , just to name a few.Do you have anything in mind ?
<user1> No , not really.But I think it should be something distinctively Chinese . And easy to carry .
<user0> I would suggest you buy paper-cuts , embroidery and batik.They are very easy to carry .
<user1> So , we'd like to see some embroidery .
<user1> I had some bread for breakfast .
<user0> Let's go out for brunch .
<user1> Brunch ?
<user0> It is a meal that combines breakfast and lunch . On Sundays , many Americans sleep late and go out for brunch . Those who go to church without having breakfast have brunch also .
<user1> Actually , many Taiwanese wake up late on Sunday mornings , too . It may be a good idea for them to eat brunch instead of eating breakfast and lunch .
<user1> My name is Jeff .
<user0> What do you do ?
<user1> I ' m a podiatrist . What about you ?
<user0> I ' m a nurse.What do you do in your free time ?
<user1> I like to play piano , go bowling and chat with my friends.And you ?
<user0> I like to hang out with my friends , play games and go swimming .
<user1> Would you like to go out some time ?
<user0> Sure , that ' d be great.Where would you like to go ?
<user1> Anywhere with you .
<user0> Aren ' t you sweet .
<user1> Well , it depends . You see , there are eight famous Chinese for instance , the Sichuan cuisine , and the Hunan cuisine .
<user0> They are both spicy hot , I've heard .
<user1> That's right . If you like hot dishes , you could try some .
<user0> They might be too hot for me .
<user1> Then there's the Cantonese cuisine and the Kiangsu cuisine . Most southerners like them .
<user0> What about any special Beijing dishes ?
<user1> There's the Beijing roast duck .
<user0> Oh , yes . I've heard a lot about it . I'd like very much to try it . Where can I find it ?
<user1> You can find it in most restaurants , but the best place is certainly Quanjude Restaurant .
<user0> Is it near here ?
<user1> Not too near but not too far either . A taxi will take you there in 15 minutes , If the traffic is not too bad , I mean .
<user0> Well , thank you for your information . But what is the name of that restaurant again ?
<user1> Let me write it down on this slip of paper for you . You can show it to the taxi-driver .
<user0> That's very kind of you . Thanks a lot .
<user1> I ' m well . And you ?
<user0> fine . How ' s your job going ?
<user1> I don ' t know if I told you or not , but I decided to start my own business .
<user0> really ? That ' s fantastic . What kind of business is it ?
<user1> I ' Ve started an investment banking firm with some of my old colleagues from Goldman Sachs .
<user0> how ' s it going ?
<user1> it started off a bit slow , but now , business is really booming !
<user0> that ' s such great news . I ' m really happy for you ! Where is your office located ?
<user1> our headoffice is here in Beijing , but we ' re planning on opening up two more offices soon .
<user0> where will those be located ?
<user1> if all goes well , we ' ll open one up in Hong Kong in April and another one in Singapore in October .
<user0> when will you find out ?
<user1> we ' re negotiating the final details of the leasing contracts tomorrow .
<user0> well , good luck . I hope it all goes well for you tomorrow !
<user1> thanks !
<user1> Pretty well . What about you ?
<user0> Fine . Where are the other guys ?
<user1> It's a bit disappointing that they are all out for a movie .
<user0> Bad timing . I want to see them so much . How are they ?
<user1> Not bad . I heard you are going to graduate this coming summer , right ?
<user0> Yes , that's why I'm here . I'm thinking about buying a second-hand apartment .
<user1> Did you go to a real estate agent ?
<user0> No , that will be too expensive .
<user1> That's true . By the way , what kind of apartment are you looking for ?
<user0> My first job's salary will be a bit low . So the cheaper the better . Just one I can afford .
<user1> Sure . I'll try my best to find a satisfying one for you .
<user0> I'll appreciate it so much .
<user1> My goodness ! It ' s the afternoon ? Doesn ' t the time fly ! Do come in and sit down .
<user0> Thank you .
<user1> What ' s the time ? My watch has stopped .
<user0> It ' s half past twelve .
<user1> When do you have lunch ?
<user0> From one to two .
<user1> What do you normally eat ?
<user0> We usually go to the cafeteria .
<user1> Oh , it ' s time to have lunch now .
<user0> let ' s go together .
<user1> Merry Christmas , Jina .
<user0> What are you doing there on the computer ?
<user1> Come have a look , I received many beautiful e-cards . They are from my friends , all over the world . Christmas wishes for all my friends .
<user0> That's pretty interesting . Did you get one from Haven ? The reason I ask is that I am looking for her number .
<user1> Sorry , I don't have it . But I do have her Email . You want me to sent it to you ?
<user0> Yeah , that would be great . Thanks .
<user1> No worries . I just for her card . And you can get her from Email . I would really like to talk to her again . I kind of miss her a little this days .
<user0> Thanks million .
<user1> My pleasure .
<user1> Use them from the outside in .
<user0> I see . A set for appetizers and another for the main course .
<user1> Right . We do the same thing at home . Don't you remember ?
<user0> Oh yeah . The big napkin goes on my lap .
<user1> Let's look at our menus .
<user0> Cindy , help me order because I'm still not very familiar with American cooking .
<user1> Well , we order appetizers first and then entrees .
<user1> Why are you trying to rush me off the phone ?
<user0> I really have to go .
<user1> Why ? I still wanted to talk to you .
<user0> I have things to do .
<user1> Like what ?
<user0> Don't be nosey .
<user1> I'm not . I just want to know .
<user0> Well , it's really none of your business .
<user1> That's harsh .
<user0> I'm sorry , but I have to go .
<user1> Fine .
<user1> Sorry , I won't . I'll be working against the clock to finish my presentation .
<user1> Have I really got to do those exams again , Dad ?
<user0> Of course , you have . You must try harder this time .
<user1> And must I go back to school ?
<user0> No , you needn ' t do that . You ' d better get a part-time job somewhere and go to evening classes .
<user1> But Dad , I should be working full-time at my age . I ' m nearly 17 .
<user0> You ought to have worked harder then you wouldn ' t have failed your exams . You have to take a job and study .
<user1> What else I ' Ve got to do ? Join the army ?
<user0> Who knows ! That might come to later .
<user1> How do you do ?
<user0> My name is Wang Liang , I ' m from Beijing . Where do you come from ?
<user1> I come from the city of Tangshan in Hebes Province .
<user0> You're from Tangshan ? I can't believe my ears . I was also born in Tangshan , but I was brought up in Beijing .
<user1> Really ? It's nice to meet you . How long have you been with this company ?
<user0> Just over 4 years now . Since this is your first day here , I'm sure you don't really know too much yet . Let me show you around , so you can introduce yourself to everyone .
<user1> Oh , Thank you very much !
<user1> Can't complain . And you ?
<user0> Business is booming . I understand you want to meet up with me next week . How's your schedule look ?
<user1> Let me see . I can come out and see you first thing Wednesday .
<user0> Great .
<user1> O . K . We offer a few different kinds .
<user0> I want the one with the highest interest rate .
<user1> That would be our Saver's Plus account .
<user0> 4.5 % , that's good . How much money do I have to keep in it to get that rate ?
<user1> You have to maintain a balance of $ 10,000 in the account or the rate drops to 3 % .
<user0> All right . I ' ll open one of those .
<user1> Just fill out these forms , and I ' ll be with you in one second .
<user0> Thanks .
<user1> How about an outlet ?
<user0> Great idea !
<user1> Outlets give good deals .
<user0> Thank you so much .
<user1> You're welcome .
<user1> Actually there is a sample over there . But if you still have a problem , let me know .
<user0> Oh , that's great . Thank you very much .
<user1> Yes , we shall . What size do you like ?
<user0> Well , the 4 x 6 is fine .
<user1> Which do you prefer , color or black and white ?
<user0> The last one is black and white , all the rest should need color .
<user1> OK .
<user0> I hope they will come out well . When should I pick them up ?
<user1> They will be ready at noon tomorrow . Each negative develops one print , right ?
<user0> Yes , it is . And develop them as glossy as possible .
<user1> No problem . Do you need another film ?
<user0> Yes , a roll of Kodak film please .
<user1> It is totally $ 20 including the deposit for films .
<user1> You mean the network connection ?
<user0> Yes , I wanted to look for some information on the company page just now . It took me almost one minute to open it . Then there is no response for any click .
<user1> I have the same question . I can ' t send out mails . We ' d better call the IT department and ask them to check it immediately .
<user0> Ok .
<user1> Alright . Have you been to this hospital before ?
<user0> No , I haven't . I need help quick . It hurts really badly .
<user1> I understand . It's good you came to the emergency room .
<user0> Let me see a doctor .
<user1> I'm sorry , sir . You will need to wait at least a short time.We are very busy tonight . There was a big car accident on Highway 106 .
<user0> I thought this was the emergency room .
<user1> It is . But unless you are critically injured , you still need to wait.You aren't bleeding , are you ?
<user0> No . Only a little . I fell off my porch .
<user1> Oh , that's terrible . Is it your right arm or your left arm ?
<user0> My left arm .
<user1> Can you fill out this form then ?
<user0> No , I can't . I'm left-handed .
<user1> That's very inconvenient for you then.You ' ll probably have a cast on your left arm .
<user0> Yes . But why do I have to fill out a form anyway ? This is the emergency room .
<user1> Yes , it is . But even in emergency rooms there is some paperwork to be done.Have you ever been in an emergency room before ?
<user0> No . Just let me see a doctor . I'm worried about my arm .
<user1> Be brave , sir . It won't be long . I will fill out the form for you . What is your name ?
<user0> Steve Schliessman . S C H L I E S S M A N .
<user1> Alright Steve . Your social security number ?
<user0> 349-95- 8821 .
<user1> Do you have medical insurance ?
<user0> Yes , I do . Blue Cross .
<user1> Do you have your insurance card with you ?
<user0> No , I don't .
<user1> Well , you can call it in later . You can phone us .
<user0> Can I sit down now ?
<user1> First I need to get your address . Try to move your arm as little as possible .
<user1> Yes , it is . Thanks . I ' m just surfing on the internet .
<user0> Here ? In this cafe ? How can you do that ?
<user1> This cafe offers a wireless internet connection . That means I can get on the net for free while I ' m here . Of course , I have to buy a cup of coffee !
<user0> That ' s great . Can you do it anywhere ?
<user1> No . you can only do it when the cafe offers a wireless connection . There are only about 10 or 12 places that offer it in this city .
<user0> So , what programs do you have on your laptop ?
<user1> I ' Ve got all the usual ones for word processing and then I have a few for creating and editing photographs .
<user0> I know you are keen on photography . It ' s very useful for you to be able to download photos from your digital camera . Then you attach the picture files to emails and send them to anyone , anywhere , at a
<user1> It ' s wonderful , isn ' t it ? Would you like to see some photos that I took recently ?
<user1> We'd better stay in the hotel , because the tour will begin tomorrow .
<user0> Let's go out for some exercise , shall we ?
<user1> What an excellent idea !
<user0> Shall we do some jogging ?
<user1> OK .
<user0> I feel well now .
<user1> Yes , some exercise is necessary for us .
<user0> Quite right .
<user1> Sure ! That would be great ! Are you good at writing or would you rather do the computer work ?
<user0> I would like to help with the computer work .
<user1> Great ! We are going to be working in teams of three . Are you OK working with others ?
<user0> Yes , I like working like that .
<user1> We will begin next Monday . Would you be available then ?
<user0> Yes , I can be there .
<user1> Well , if you could send me your basic background information before next Monday , it would be useful .
<user0> OK , I will send the information to you .
<user1> Well then , thanks for your help . Have a great day !
<user1> Thanks , Monica . Without support from you and other colleagues , I would not have made it .
<user0> I hope I could get promoted some day . Tell me about your experience , ok ?
<user1> Well , just saying that you wanted to get promoted is not enough , you need to write down your desirable position and an available plan for achieving that adjective . Don ' t be afraid of taking challenging . They might be opportunities and failing is not fatal . You learn more from that actually . Sometimes , you need to fail to be successful .
<user0> How do you think if I volunteer for some work ?
<user1> I think it is a smart idea . Our boss always likes it when employees take initiatives .
<user1> Yes , sir . Where to ?
<user0> The city square , please .
<user1> Are you in a hurry ?
<user0> Yes , I have to be there to meet a friend at 5 thirty pm . So we're sure we can get there on time ?
<user1> I'm afraid not , sir . Generally we can , but you know how it is in the rush hour now .
<user0> I see . Here's the extra 5 $ for you if you can get me there on time .
<user1> All right . I'll do my best .
<user0> Oh.we made it . Thank you . How much do I own you ?
<user1> The reading on the kilometer is 12 $ .
<user0> Here's the money , keep the changes , please .
<user1> Do you need a receipt ?
<user0> No , thank you .
<user1> Susan , I'm sorry . Did you look up those files I requested ?
<user0> Yes , but I still can not find it . Maybe it is in this cabinet .
<user1> I couldn't find the files you request , even though I checked all the cross-references . I don't think it's there .
<user0> I am sure that document was filed .
<user1> Well , let me check again under a different heading .
<user0> Good idea ! It seems that I asked you to put it in Nova's files .
<user1> Maybe that's why I couldn't find it . All the documents on Nova are filed under ' V ' .
<user1> I'll try Chinese wine .
<user0> What about this dry red ? It's good indeed , it never goes to the head .
<user1> OK . Give me one , please .
<user0> Here it is .
<user1> Thank you .
<user0> I'm always at your service .
<user1> Yes . Are you ?
<user0> I will be voting tomorrow .
<user1> What ' s your polling place ?
<user0> My polling place is at the park up the street .
<user1> Oh , yeah ?
<user0> Yeah , where is yours ?
<user1> I don ' t know .
<user0> How is it you don ' t know ?
<user1> The location of my polling place never came in the mail .
<user0> You can always just check online .
<user1> Let me go do that .
<user1> Sure . I will clean the glasses for you .
<user0> Thank you . Where is the washing room ?
<user1> Walk straight and turn left .
<user1> You do realize that you ran a red light , don't you ?
<user0> I did ?
<user1> You didn't see the red light ?
<user0> I'm sorry for running it , but I really didn't know .
<user1> Didn't you learn that red means stop ?
<user0> I know that .
<user1> Then tell me why you sped up on the yellow light .
<user0> I'm not sure .
<user1> I'm giving you a ticket for this .
<user0> I'm sorry for the misunderstanding .
<user1> Maybe you'll think about this before you decide to run another light .
<user1> Good afternoon , could you connect this call with Mr Brown , please
<user0> May I know who's calling ?
<user1> This is Li Ping of ABC computer company limited . I'm calling on our Mr Wilson the general manager of our company .
<user0> I'm sorry , Mrs Li , Mr Brown is now in a meeting.May I have your number , and ask him to call you back later ?
<user1> I'm afraid Mr Wilson would like to speak to Mr Brown right now.He ' s got an urgent matter to discuss with Mr Brown without delay .
<user0> Ok , then would you please hold the line ? Mr Li , the line is through , Mr Brown is ready answering the call , go ahead .
<user1> Thank you for your assistance , Mr Bush .
<user0> You are welcome .
<user1> Oh , that's right . And the general manager asked me to report the company's sales for last year at the meeting .
<user0> By the way , the meeting will be held in your office .
<user1> OK , thank you very much .
<user0> Not at all . That's what I should do .
<user1> Of course . What do you want me to do , Mom ?
<user0> Could you hold these packages while I look for the key ?
<user1> Alright , what's in them ? They are so heavy !
<user0> Just things we need for the picnic tomorrow .
<user1> Well , hurry up and open the door please . I told you these things are heavy .
<user0> I'm sorry , but I just can't find the key . You must have it .
<user1> Oh , yes , it's in my pocket . But how can I get the key while I'm holding all these bags ?
<user1> Yes , Mr . Ford . The dentist will be ready to see you in a minute . Have a seat .
<user0> Thank you .
<user1> I am not sleepy .
<user0> It's getting late , and you have to wake up early tomorrow .
<user1> There is no way that I can fall asleep right now .
<user0> Try listening to some soft music .
<user1> It won't work . I'm nowhere close to being tired .
<user0> I really don't care , just go to sleep .
<user1> What if I stay up and do something , until I get tired ?
<user0> You'll be up all night if I let you do that .
<user1> I'm going to get to sleep eventually .
<user0> You need to go to sleep now , so go to sleep .
<user1> Good night .
<user1> What did you find ?
<user0> I found some jeans , and a new blouse .
<user1> Go and try it on .
<user0> What do you think ?
<user1> I love that shirt on you .
<user0> What about the jeans ?
<user1> They don't really fit you right .
<user0> I don't think so either .
<user1> That blouse is absolutely wonderful on you though .
<user0> Well , I'll just buy the shirt .
<user1> That would be a good idea .
<user1> Thank you very much . I ' Ve tried to keep it short and clear . If there ' s any questions please feel free to ask me .
<user0> Well yes , I do have a number of questions , but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview I ' d like to get a little bit of an idea of your background .
<user1> Yes , of course . Well as you can see from the resume I ' m 27 and grew up in Brooklyn , New York , although our family moved to London when I was quite young , at around sixteen .
<user0> Ah I see , so you were actually educated in Europe ?
<user1> Yes precisely . Although I was born in the US , I would definitely call London home . But as you see I ' Ve actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country . My Father was in the oil business before he retired so we also spent a number of years in Saudi Arabia too .
<user0> Very interesting . So it seems you had quite an adventurous childhood .
<user1> Absolutely ! We were never still for too long . But now I ' m really looking to settle down .
<user0> I see . okay , well let ' s move on to discuss your education shall we ?
<user1> We ran a call center training service and language program to ensure that our customer service representatives are well trained .
<user0> What ' s the result ?
<user1> We directly attribute an increase in our customer service feedback of 50 % to the increase in language skills and training that our employees have received .
<user0> That seems very impressive . Good work !
<user1> Thank you , but I cannot take all the credit . Our employees have all worked very hard to increase their productivity level .
<user1> I'd been feeling pretty well until just a few days ago .
<user0> What seems to be the trouble now ?
<user1> I feel run down , tired . I've been having headaches almost every day . And I'm not getting as much sleep as usually do .
<user0> Have you been eating properly ? Eating the right kind of food is important for your health , you know .
<user1> Well , I haven't been eating well , I guess . I usually only have enough time to grab a sandwich and a cup of coffee for lunch .
<user0> And what about dinner ?
<user1> Sometimes I'm too tired to eat anything at all .
<user0> That's not good . You don't have a well-balanced diet . Have you been taking vitamin pills ?
<user1> I don't like to take any medicine at all without talking it over with a doctor first .
<user1> No , thank you .
<user0> Would you like us to deliver the mattress for you , sir ?
<user1> That would be great .
<user0> When do you want it delivered ?
<user1> I need it delivered tomorrow . Will that be possible ?
<user0> What time exactly ?
<user1> I need it delivered at 12 o'clock .
<user0> We can have it to you at that time .
<user1> That's not a problem ?
<user0> We will deliver your mattress tomorrow at 12 o'clock .
<user1> That's great ! Thank you very much .
<user1> Yes , I'm looking for a house .
<user0> To buy or to rent ?
<user1> Oh , to rent .
<user0> How much do you want to pay ?
<user1> About 300 a month .
<user0> Well , I've got one here . It's 260 a month .
<user1> How big is it ?
<user0> It's got a kitchen , a bathroom , and one bedroom .
<user1> Well , actually I prefer something a bit bigger if that's possible .
<user0> Yes , I think so . There is also an interesting one.It ' s opposite the park .
<user1> How much is it ?
<user0> It's 325 a month . It's the biggest we've got in this area .
<user1> What's it like ?
<user0> Well , There're two bedrooms , a sitting room , a kitchen and a bathroom .
<user1> It sounds interesting . Can I go and see it ?
<user0> Of course , Sir .
<user1> Yes , Sir .
<user0> These two are urgent letters and should be sent by registered express airmail . Others are ordinary letters .
<user1> All right , who should I send them to ?
<user0> It ' s sent to Mr . Charles . I believe he is in London .
<user1> Ok , home or office address ?
<user0> Office address , please . He might be at work when they arrive .
<user1> Should I enclose this commercial paper with these two letters ?
<user0> Yes , it ' s right .
<user1> Oh , it ' s the latest novel by Ray Blue . It ' s a sic-fi thriller .
<user0> I thought he usually wrote horror books .
<user1> He does . He ' s good at this genre too . It ' s a captivating read .
<user0> We ' re going to the bookshop . Would you like to join us ?
<user1> Yes , I would . I need to buy a textbook for my course and , as you know , I love browsing through the latest paperbacks .
<user0> Me too . I need something to read on the flight to New York . I can never sleep on planes . Sarah wants to pick up some children ' s books for her daughter .
<user1> I want to look at nelson Mandela ' s autobiography .
<user0> This is sure to be a worthwhile read .
<user1> How long have you had this pain ?
<user0> For about a week or so , but it ' s gotten really bad in the last couple of days .
<user1> Did you do anything that might have aggravated your tooth ?
<user0> You know , I was eating jawbreakers in the movies the other day , and I accidentally bit down really hard on one .
<user1> What kind of toothbrush do you use ?
<user0> I just use a regular hard bristle toothbrush .
<user1> Does it bother you when you eat something really cold ?
<user0> Yes , it definitely bothers me more when I do that .
<user1> Good evening.My wife and I would like a room , please.Is there any room available ? We don't have a reservation .
<user0> Let me see.Yes , we have one room left.You ' re lucky.It ' s the last one .
<user1> Good.We ' re tired after driving all day , and we're looking forward to relaxing in a comfortable room .
<user0> This room has two double beds.It ' s number 56 at the rear of the motel.It ' s quite a comfortable room .
<user1> How much is it for one night ? We only need it for tonight.We ' re going to continue our trip in the morning .
<user0> It's forty-five dollars a night for two.Is anyone else traveling with you ?
<user1> No , it's just the two of us .
<user0> Would you like to pay for the room in cash or with a credit card ?
<user1> Credit card.We don't like to carry much cash with us on our trips .
<user0> Please fill out this registration card.Here is your key.You can park your car in front of our room.Check - out time is noon .
<user1> Thank you very much .
<user0> Thank you , sir.Enjoy your stay with us .
<user1> What do you want to do ?
<user0> I want to get a puppy for my son .
<user1> That will make him so happy .
<user0> I'll get him one of those little dogs .
<user1> One that won't grow up too big .
<user0> And eat too much .
<user1> Do you know which one he would like ?
<user0> Oh , yes , I took him there yesterday . He showed me one that he really liked .
<user1> I bet you had to drag him away .
<user0> He wanted to take it home yesterday .
<user1> I wonder what he'll name it .
<user1> OK . Is it in the box ? May I see it ?
<user0> Yes . This is the computer and this is the keyboard and the monitor .
<user1> Is there anything else ?
<user0> There are a mouse and a camera .
<user1> Is that all ?
<user0> Yes . How much is it to send these things to Shanghai by regular delivery ?
<user1> It depends on the weight of these things . Generally speaking , we will charge you ten yuan for one kilogram .
<user0> I see . Can you weigh them for me , please ?
<user1> Please go over there to weigh them .
<user0> OK . See you later .
<user1> didn't you hear ? He was disqualified .
<user0> how did that happen ? He's so talented ! I thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal !
<user1> if he didn't have any drug problems , he would have won .
<user0> what ? What kind of drugs was he using ?
<user1> he was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster .
<user0> I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs .
<user1> they are . The reason why they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards .
<user0> that's so disappointing . I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs .
<user1> I don't think it's right , but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country !
<user0> regardless of how much pressure you're under , there's never a good reason to take drugs .
<user1> I agree . Hopefully with the new regulations , fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs .
<user0> let's hope so .
<user1> What ' s stopping you ?
<user0> I ' m not sure how .
<user1> I don ' t understand .
<user0> I ' Ve never used one before .
<user1> I can help you figure it out .
<user0> What do I have to do ?
<user1> Slide your card into the machine .
<user0> Then what ?
<user1> You need to type your PIN in .
<user0> What do I have to do next ?
<user1> Click on whichever option you want , and you ' re done .
<user1> Yep . There's still so much to do !
<user0> So let's start by checking off what we've already done .
<user1> Did you reconfirm the plane reservations for all the Taiwanese guests ?
<user0> Not yet , I was busy getting that videographer who films stuff for the Net .
<user1> Cool ! I can't believe he agreed to go all the way to Dallas with us !
<user0> Hey ! We're paying for his ticket !
<user1> We have a great variety of Chinese antiques and porcelain . Do you like them ?
<user0> Yes , I love them , but they are fragile . It is not convenient to take them .
<user1> You are right . How about paintings and embroidered handkerchiefs ?
<user0> Sounds good . May I have a look ?
<user1> Of course . These paintings have many designs , such as animals , flowers , landscape , aquatics and so on .
<user0> They are beautiful , but I can't understand the connotation in them . Let me see the handkerchiefs .
<user1> All right . Chinese embroidery is one traditional art with elaborate design and high quality .
<user0> Oh , I like the bamboo design . What is this ?
<user1> This is a series of animals , called Chinese zodiac .
<user0> Good . So I will take three series and five bamboo ones .
<user1> OK , I will wrap them for you .
<user1> No , it's too loud in here .
<user1> Yes ?
<user0> Can you tell me the way to the Peak Tram , please ?
<user1> Certainly . Go along Queen's Road ...
<user0> Along Queen's Road ...
<user1> Yes , and turn right at the Hilton Hotel .
<user0> Right at the Hilton .
<user1> Then go up Garden Road , past the Cathedral .
<user0> The Cathedral ?
<user1> Yes . Then cross the road at the next traffic lights . The Peak Tram is straight ahead . You can't miss it .
<user0> That's very kind of you . Thank you . Er ... have you got a pencil ?
<user1> Yes . Why ?
<user0> Can you repeat all that ? I think I'd better write it down .
<user1> I'm starving . Let's go grab a bite .
<user0> Where to ?
<user1> How about Karlis ?
<user0> Are you kidding ? That place is too ritzy for lunch .
<user1> True . ok Let's go to Grumose ?
<user0> Same thing , meals there all coarsen arm and leg .
<user1> I guess it is a little pricy .
<user0> Let's stop it at Multicolor for a quick lunch ..
<user1> That will be Ok . Come on , I can't wait to chow down .
<user0> That was a great lunch , the food was good , but the service was lousy .
<user1> Is that why you stiffed the waiter ?
<user0> You got it . All right , Let's go back to school .
<user1> Good morning . I'd like a business suit made with this material .
<user0> Do you have a particular style in mind ?
<user1> The kind that never goes out of fashion , I guess .
<user0> I think you should realize that even the most conservative style changes .
<user1> I'm sure you're right . I just dread the idea of making a new suit every year .
<user0> The changes are usually not that dramatic . We just got some pictures of the latest fashion . Would you like to take a look ?
<user1> Good . I think I'll choose this single breasted one . When can I get it ?
<user0> Next Friday .
<user1> Thank you .
<user1> Don't take it too hard . There are some tips you should know in job-hunting of 2010 .
<user0> Well , I am all ears . Maybe they are helpful .
<user1> Firstly , you must always show your best to the interviewer . And secondly , try to avoid spamming through e-mails , because this will make the reader go crazy . The last but not the least , there is no substitute for pounding the pavement in such a digital age .
<user0> I understand what you mean , and I will not upset myself . Face it .
<user1> Good luck to us .
<user1> Oh , I remember , there is a job fair in the personnel market .
<user0> I have never been to the personnel market .
<user1> Really ? I have been there several times .
<user0> Are there many employers ?
<user1> Yes . The personnel market is a place specially for job-hunters and employers .
<user0> So there will be many large companies in the personnel market , right ?
<user1> Yes , there are many famous corporations .
<user0> When will there be a job fair ?
<user1> Every Saturday and Sunday
<user0> Do I need to pay to go into the personnel market ?
<user1> No , it's free .
<user0> How about going there to have a look now ?
<user1> OK , let's go .
<user1> Here you are . We have three different colors , white , blue and pink .
<user0> What's the price ?
<user1> $ 12 .
<user0> Can you make it any cheaper ?
<user1> It is cheap .
<user0> I'll take it if you give me a discount .
<user1> $ 10 . That's the best I can do .
<user0> OK . I'll take the blue one .
<user1> Yes , yes . It seems that everything is settled .
<user0> Have you decided how you would like the salaries paid ?
<user1> We have discussed it and decided that at the moment we would like the salaries to be paid into the employees's accounts , whether they are currently with this bank or not .
<user0> That's not a problem .
<user1> Of course , if we are happy with the service after the initial period we will recommend all employees either transfer their accounts to this bank , or open new accounts with you .
<user0> Thank you very much . We always welcome new customers .
<user1> We should plan to move out of here before July . I'm tired of living in apartments .
<user0> I know , dear . I am too . But we've just been too busy to look for a house .
<user1> We need to find a good realtor .
<user0> Not necessarily . If we use a realtor to find a house , it will be more expensive .
<user1> What do you mean ?
<user0> Realtors always get a commission.If the realtor helps us find something , we have to pay him .
<user1> But doesn't a realtor help with the contract ? I thought they take care of all the legal troubles .
<user0> Yes , that's often true . But you have to pay them .
<user1> I still think we should have a realtor.We ' re new in this country . We don't know all the laws of buying a house.And also , the realtor will inspect the house.He can tell us if the house has
<user0> Of course we need a home inspector.But we can hire an inspector on our own.And as for the legal problems , I have friends . They can help us .
<user1> So how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor ?
<user0> It takes a little more time . We have to check the ads in the paper.Probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads.Then we have to drive to the homes and look at them .
<user1> And doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor ?
<user0> Sometimes they do , sometimes they don't . It's best to find someone who is selling by themselves .
<user1> Why ?
<user0> Because if the seller has a realtor , their price will be higher.He will have to pay a commission to the realtor .
<user1> Hmm . It all sounds very complicated .
<user0> It is . But buying a house is very important . So it takes time.That ' s why we haven't done it yet . It's very troublesome .
<user1> I want to look in the papers today . Maybe we can see something we like .
<user0> Alright . I'll buy a newspaper when I go to the drug store .
<user1> Sorry to hear that .
<user0> How about next week ?
<user1> Fine , we'll be expecting you then .
<user1> I'd like to taste Mexican food .
<user0> How about the one on Baker Street ?
<user1> Oh , I've never seen a better Mexican restaurant .
<user1> I know , but these are the figures that we came up with .
<user1> You ' re welcome . Can I ask you what brings you to China ?
<user0> I ' m actually travelling around Asia .
<user1> Oh , very nice . How long will you be in Beijing ?
<user0> Probably another week .
<user1> Oh , I see . Well , I ' ll give you my phone number and if you need a guide , please call me .
<user0> Thank you very much . That ' s very kind .
<user1> Sure , but I have to finish this report first .
<user0> Never mind . I'll do it .
<user1> Yes , in some sense . I should say I like mountain climbing , you know , because I'm not so professional . How about you
<user0> I'm the same with you , an amateur mountain climber . I went climbing in the Rocky Mountains with my friends last summer vacation . We spent two days in the mountains .
<user1> How did you spend the night there ?
<user0> We pitched a tent in the night , waiting for the sunrise . Wow ! It was too beautiful .
<user1> I had a similar experience , but that was on the top of Tasha Mountain in my country .
<user0> Tasha Mountain ? It's very famous in China , isn't ?
<user1> Yes . It is one of the Five Mountains .
<user0> I want to climb Tasha Mountain this summer vacation . Would you be my guide ?
<user1> I'd love to .
<user1> I have a spasm of nausea and dizziness .
<user0> Have you ever suffered from airsickness before ? You're probably airsick .
<user1> No , this is the first time on a plane . Maybe you are right .. Please get me some pills .
<user0> OK . I will get some for you . There's an airsickness bag behind the seat in front of you.Please wait me for a moment . ( Go away for a few minutes , and now she comes back . ) Here are two pills . And the water is in the glass too.Please take the pills with water .
<user1> Thank you very much . ( Take the pills . )
<user0> Are you feeling better now ?
<user1> Much better now . Thanks again .
<user0> My pleasure .
<user1> Jane , I ' m on the other line , can you hang on for a second ?
<user0> Sure .
<user1> OK , I ' ll be right back .
<user1> Yes . First I'll have tomato juice .
<user0> And then ?
<user1> I'll have the lamb chops , well-done , please .
<user1> Can you show me some traditional Chinese arts and crafts ?
<user0> Maybe sandalwood fan is good .
<user1> Would you show me some ?
<user0> Of course .
<user1> They really smell fragrant . How much is a real sandalwood fan ?
<user0> The small ones are one hundred yuan for each . And the big ones are two hundred and thirty yuan .
<user1> I'll take two small ones and a big one .
<user0> What else are you interested in ?
<user1> I'm afraid not .
<user0> OK . Here you are .
<user1> Good morning ! Can you help me , please ? I'm looking for some books for my mother .
<user0> Well , what kind of books does she like ?
<user1> She's very fond of detective stories ?
<user0> I see.Has she read any detective stories ?
<user1> Oh , yes !
<user0> Do you know if she's read this one ?
<user1> I'm not sure , but she probably won't remember if she has ! She's very forgetful !
<user0> Ah ! She has a bad memory.How old is she ?
<user1> She's eighty-seven .
<user0> I suggest you take this book.It ' s very exciting .
<user1> Thank you.That ' s a good idea.she likes exciting books.Can you suggest another one ?
<user1> Not really . Quite boring right now , actually . Mostly infomercials and public service announcements .
<user0> Why don't you turn off the TV and get outside ? You need to get some fresh air .
<user1> I know , I know.But my favorite show is on in a couple of minutes . It's the series finals , and I wouldn't miss it for the world !
<user0> Really ? What's the series about ?
<user1> Well , it's about how an immigrant girl achieve her dream in America . It's a sitcom but really quite smart and really funny . I think you'd like it .
<user0> It sounds interesting , but I am not a big fan of TV shows . They're time consuming and don't have much depth .
<user1> I believe some shows are quite informative and interesting . Take this show for example , it examines American xenophobia and how it might conflict with the American dream , with hilarious results .
<user0> Really ? that's interesting !
<user1> Yeah.Oh , here it comes ! why don't we watch it together ? they are going to have a court debate in this episode . It should be good .
<user0> OK , I'll give it a go .
<user1> Would you turn off the tap ?
<user0> I did it .
<user1> Then will you put all the towels under the bathroom door .
<user0> Ok , I will .
<user1> I will have our housekeeper come right away .
<user0> I am sorry , I was too tired to fall asleep .
<user1> When you woke up , the water was coming out the tub ?
<user0> Right . Can I compensate for the damage with the travel accident insurance ?
<user1> Well , little girls seem to love Barbie dolls .
<user0> That's perfect . I want to see one .
<user1> Here you are — she's called Digital Barbie .
<user0> Oh , I like Digital Barbie ! How much does she cost ?
<user1> This Barbie is only $ 29.95 .
<user0> That's perfect . Let me have her .
<user1> Very good . Is there anything else you would like ?
<user0> No , that'll do it for now .
<user1> Including tax , your total will be $ 32.42 . Cash or charge ?
<user0> Let me give you cash , please .
<user1> Here's your change and receipt . Thank you .
<user1> Yes , sir . Please examine it .
<user0> Anything subject to duty in your suitcase ?
<user1> No , sir . Nothing except my personal belongings , such as clothes , notebooks and some gifts .
<user0> Any cigarettes or liquor ?
<user1> I have cigarettes for my own use .
<user0> I think you'll have to pay some duty on these cigarettes because they exceed the quota . And this article is liable for duty .
<user1> How much duty should I pay ?
<user0> One hundred dollars .
<user1> Here is the money .
<user0> Just a moment . I'll make out your duty memo . ( Writing and giving the memo to Mr . Green ) Take it and pay the girl over there .
<user1> Thank you .
<user1> We wanted to appeal to a younger set of consumers and also , in line with that goal , redo our image ...
<user0> That's correct . If you remember , we also set a goal to double distribution in overseas markets . Now , when looking at the data to evaluate whether or not we made our goals , there are three things to consider . First , the original condition of the market , second , our marketing numbers from the previous year , and third , our final sales figures for this year . Now I want to describe for you the second and third parts . If you look at the overhead , you'll see a graph ... The blue line represents our sales from the year 2005 , the red line is the sales in 2006 ... As you can see , our sales in 2005 were quite slow to start off with , but managed to make decent performance in the last part of the year . On the other hand , you can see this year's sales took off like a rocket .
<user1> Bill ! Sure , come on in . What can I do for you ?
<user0> Well sir , as you know , I have been an employee of this prestigious firm for over ten years .
<user1> Yes .
<user0> I won ' t beat around the bush . Sir , I would like a raise . I currently have three companies after me and so I decided to talk to you first .
<user1> A raise ? Son , I would love to give you a raise , but this is just not the right time .
<user0> I understand your position , and I know that the current economic downturn has had a negative impact on sales , but you must also take into consideration my hard work , pro-activeness and loyalty to this company for over a decade .
<user1> Taking into account these factors , and considering I don ' t want to start a brain drain , I ' m willing to offer you a ten percent raise and an extra five days of vacation time . How does that sound ?
<user0> Great ! It ' s a deal ! Thank you , sir !
<user1> Before you go , just out of curiosity , what companies were after you ?
<user0> Oh , the electric company , gas company and water company !
<user1> Of course . How about you ?
<user0> I ' Ve already voted .
<user1> How ' s that ?
<user0> I sent in an absentee ballot .
<user1> Why ?
<user0> I won ' t be able to vote on Tuesday .
<user1> Why not ?
<user0> I have to work .
<user1> Why don ' t you go to work late ?
<user0> I have important business to take care of that morning .
<user1> I see .
<user1> I think the job should make use of the professional experience I have obtained , and offer me opportunity for advancement .
<user0> Why do you think you might like to work for our company ?
<user1> I feel my background and experience are a good fit for this position and I am very interested.What ' s more , your company is outstanding in this field .
<user0> What makes you think you would be a success in this position ?
<user1> My graduate school training combined with my experience as an intern should qualify me for this particular job . I am sure I will be successful .
<user0> How do you know about this company ?
<user1> Your company is very reputed in this city . I heard much praise to your company .
<user1> No . I haven't had a chance to read the paper yet .
<user0> you've got to see it . It's an unbelievable picture !
<user1> What's so interesting about it ?
<user0> Well , this guy fell asleep on the sofa and when he woke up , half his face had been bitten off !
<user1> What ? How did that happen ?
<user0> They think his dog was trying to wake him up and couldn't , so ended up biting him in his face .
<user1> Wow . What does his look like now ?
<user0> It looks pretty frightening . He doesn't have any lips , so all you can see are his gums and teeth . Most of his nose and chin are missing too .
<user1> What did he look like before his dog bit his face off ?
<user0> He was actually quite handsome . What a shame .
<user1> What's he going to do now ?
<user0> It said that he's hoping to get a face transplant , but until then , he's looking forward to Halloween so he isn't the only one wearing a mask .
<user1> OK . By the way , I'd like to tell you that the check-out time is 12
<user0> I see .
<user1> Have you used any hotel services this morning or had breakfast at the hotel dining room , Mr . Green ?
<user0> Yes , my friend and I just had breakfast at the dining room , but we didn't use any services .
<user1> How about the charge for the days you shared the room with your friend ?
<user0> Please add to my account .
<user1> The total for the eight days is five hundred sixty yuan .
<user0> OK . Here you are .
<user1> What's the problem ?
<user0> I need help turning them on .
<user1> You need change .
<user0> The machines take change ?
<user1> Yes . It costs fifty cents for the washer and a dollar for the dryer .
<user0> Where do i put the money in ?
<user1> You put the coins into the slot , push it in , and it will turn on .
<user0> That's it ?
<user1> There's nothing else to it .
<user0> Thank you very much .
<user1> You're welcome . Let me know if you need anything else .
<user1> What for ?
<user0> I want to get a ticket for a concert tonight .
<user1> All right.Here ' s the money . I suppose I'll have to drive you there .
<user1> With my experience , I'd like to start at 3,000 RIB per month .
<user0> Well , it is a little more than we had planned .
<user1> I think you will find I am worth it .
<user1> My hands are full . Can ' t you see that ?
<user0> Please , George .
<user1> All right . Just wait a minute , OK ?
<user1> All wet.You are such a fool .
<user1> I'd like to get this prescription filled .
<user0> No problem . Please wait a minute . ( She goes to the back for a few minutes . ) Here is your medicine , sir . Take two tablets after each meal and once before bed .
<user1> Thanks . Do you sell aspirin here ?
<user0> Yes , our over-the-counter medicine is over there on that shelf .
<user1> Oh , I see it . Do you have multi-vitamins ?
<user0> Yes , right over here .
<user1> ( The customer gets the aspirin and vitamins . ) That'll be $ 16.00 .
<user0> Here's a twenty .
<user1> Here's your change . Thank you .
<user1> 2 hours .
<user0> What for ?
<user1> The plane must fuel before flying to Paris .
<user0> Can we get off the plane ?
<user1> Surely of course .
<user1> I have a camera and three bottles of whisky .
<user0> OK . You'll have to pay duty for the whisky .
<user1> Well , where shall I pay the duty for the whisky ?
<user0> Please wait a moment . I'll make out the duty memo . Here you are . Take this and pay the people over there .
<user1> I've paid the duty . Here is the receipt
<user0> Very well . I hope you'll enjoy your stay in China .
<user1> Thank you .
<user1> Of course .
<user0> Well , I think this one is a little too small . Would you please bring me a bigger one ?
<user1> I am sorry the larger ones are out of stock now . But you might be lucky at our Branch .
<user1> What kind of rooms do you want ?
<user0> A single room with a bath and one double room facing the lake .
<user1> No problem . Your room numbers are 201 and 204 .
<user0> Thank you .
<user1> Yes . I have lost about ten kilos .
<user0> How did you do it ?
<user1> I am on a diet . And I do more exercise regularly .
<user0> What's the secret then ?
<user1> It lies in perseverance .
<user0> Well . It's hard for me . I can't keep doing exercise .
<user1> You should have a try .
<user1> Of course . What kind of postal savings account do you want to open ?
<user0> Hum .. Can you recommend me one with high interest ?
<user1> OK . We offer a few different kinds of postal saving services . They have different interest rates .
<user0> I want the one with the highest interest rate .

<user0> All right . I'II open this one .
<user1> Just fill out these forms , and I ' ll be with you in one second .
<user0> Thanks .

<user1> Do you like to use chopsticks
<user0> Yes , I like using chopsticks .
<user1> Do you like some soup ?
<user0> Yes , but I don't know what soup you have .
<user1> We have beef soup and tomato soup .
<user0> Good . I prefer beef soup .
<user1> According to usual practices , we serve dishes first and then soup . If you like we'll bring you some soup first .

<user1> I guess there is some kind of virus seeking into my computer , I can ' t send out this e-mail . Do you have the number of the text port ?
<user0> Do you mind I have a look at your computer ?
<user1> Of course not , I appreciate that .
<user0> Well , it has nothing to do with virus . The problem is your attachment is a bit larger . It has exceeded the e-mail capacity .
<user1> I see . What can I do now ?
<user0> You can send a compressed one .
<user1> Well , I think the color is a little too bright .
<user0> We have darker ones . Do you like the style ?
<user1> Yes . What's this made of and how to wash it ?
<user0> lt's made of silk and you had better wash it by hand in cold water .
<user1> I pay much attention to my daily diet . You know good eating habits help to fortify the body against disease .
<user0> Yeah , you are right . Tell me your normal diet .

<user0> I'm coming for the job you've advertised in yesterday's newspaper .
<user1> OK . What's your working experience ?
<user0> I have worked for IBM for three years .
<user1> How do your experiences benefit our company ?
<user0> I know the marketing from top to bottom and I can develop a new market for you .
<user1> Are you aware of the aspects of this position and do you feel you are qualified ?
<user0> Yes , I understand my qualification and your needs by researching your company .
<user1> If you enter this company , what section would you like to work in ?
<user0> If possible , I'd like to be positioned in the International Trade Department .
<user1> Then , what starting salary do you expect ?
<user0> I'd like to start at RIB 4,000 a month .
<user1> Let me see . Here it is .
<user0> Could you tell me how to get there ?
<user1> I ' m afraid I can ' t because I ' m a stranger here .
<user0> Oh , thanks all the same .
<user1> Not at all . You can ask the policeman over there .
<user1> That's fine . We can supply all kinds of precision machine tools . Our products are much admired in the world market and enjoy a wide acceptance in modern industry .
<user0> Can I have a look at your catalogue and the corresponding technical data ?
<user1> Why , of course . Here are some that will show you our latest development . You may select which ever you need .
<user0> I think our users have the impression that your prices are always much too high , compared with those of other supplies .
<user1> Excuse me . It's true that our products do cost slightly more than the other makers , but It's only due to our technological superiority .
<user0> Your products may have certain advantages , but your prices are too stiff .
<user1> If you give us your inquiry , I shall go very carefully into the price and try my best to put you on the best of the terms .
<user0> OK , I'll come back to discuss it to some details after our users have studied your catalogues and price list .
<user1> Yes , surely . We hope to do some substantial business with you .
<user1> Yes , what would you recommend ?
<user0> I'm happy to recommend the fish , It testes delicious , and it is today's special . Our chef is from the coast , and love seafood . Today special is actually his favorite dish . so I'm sure it is a
<user1> It does sound wonderful , maybe I'll try it .
<user0> Is there anything else ? Maybe I can interest you in one of fine appetizers , such as the escargot .
<user1> Not today , thanks . But I'd like to know any of the vegetarian dishes .
<user0> Yes , here's the menu . What would you think of your order .
<user1> Maybe I don't want the fish , I think I had the greenbean dish instead .
<user0> What kind of soup would you like ?
<user1> I'd like the egg drop soup .
<user0> Ok , is that all ?
<user1> Yes .
<user0> what would you like anything to drink or you wait ?
<user1> Just nice water , thanks .
<user1> Wow , fantastic . I like the font and color for his name . It is creative yet personal .
<user0> Yes , it is a bold design . People will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . It just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations .
<user1> I agree . Business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . It won ' t take much time to design an amazing card , but it can make a big difference among the crowd . And you ' ll always notice it from your collection . For they have outspoken colors , own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . I wish to have one like this . But for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow .
<user1> Yes . Where do you want to go ?
<user0> The Workers'Stadium .
<user1> This is the right bus .
<user0> Will you let me know where to get off ?
<user1> Certainly.Four more stop after this . I'll call out the stops .
<user0> Thank you .
<user1> Oh , I was out sick most of last week . I ' m still not completely over it . You ' d better not get too close !
<user0> I ' m sorry to hear about that . Why don ' t you join me for a hot cup of tea ? It ' ll be good for you !
<user1> Sure , why not ? I could use a rest .
<user1> That's no problem at all . May I have your name , please ?
<user0> Certainly . My name is John Sandals .
<user1> It's a pleasure , Mr . Sandals . My name is Michelle . What days will you need a room ?
<user0> Friday afternoon , April 14 through Monday morning , April 17 .
<user1> One minor problem , sir . Our prices are now slightly higher . Is that acceptable , sir ?
<user0> Please tell me the price , so I can make a decision .
<user1> It'll be $ 308 nightly .
<user0> That's a reasonable price .
<user1> Good ! Now , sir , do you have a preference for smoking or nonsmoking ?
<user0> I quit smoking , so nonsmoking .
<user1> I hear you , sir . Nonsmoking . Now , about the bed , is a queen-size okay ?
<user0> A queen sounds great .
<user1> Okay , sir , let me reserve those dates , there . Now , if you'll just tell me your phone number .
<user0> That would be 626-555-1739 .
<user1> That's 626-555-1739 . Thank you so much for choosing our hotel , sir !
<user1> yes , doesn't everyone ?
<user0> what's your favorite animal ?
<user1> it's hard to say . While dogs are more affectionate , cats are much easier to take care of .
<user0> have you ever had a dog ?
<user1> when I was little , we had a few domestic dogs at home .
<user0> they always say that dogs are a man's best friends . do you think that's true ?
<user1> definitely . rich or poor , dogs always love their masters .
<user0> how about cats ? Have you ever had one for a pet ?
<user1> i had one a few months ago , but she ended up running away .
<user0> how did that happen ?
<user1> she left through a window that was open one night and never returned .
<user0> you must have been devastated !
<user1> i was pretty sad . i still hope that she'll return some day !
<user0> I hope she does . Do you think you'll ever get another pet ?
<user1> I think I will . It's difficult to feel longly when you have a pet around .
<user0> i hope your cat finds its way back home .
<user1> i do , too .
<user1> we just moved in yesterday , actually .
<user0> so , what do you think about the place ? Are you glad that you moved in ?
<user1> it's great ! Unfortunately , we're going to spend a fortune doing everything up .
<user0> how old is the house then ?
<user1> it's about 200 years old . It has a lot of history !
<user0> sounds fascinating . Where is your new house located ?
<user1> it's just off of the ring road .
<user0> do you have a big yard ?
<user1> it's bigger than our last one . I've got flowers in the front , and fruits , vegetables and a fish pond in the back .
<user0> is your house well-lit ?
<user1> oh , yes . Our windows let plenty of natural light in . They've also got wonderful views of the park behind our house .
<user0> how many rooms does your house have ?
<user1> right now , there are three bedrooms , two barrooms , a kitchen , a sitting room , a dining room , and a living room . We're hoping to add on a green room and a guest bedroom . In fact , when the guest room i
<user0> I'd be up for that !
<user1> Your achievement is obvious to all .
<user0> What we will do is to strengthen it .
<user1> Yes , this is also the competitive edge of our company .
<user1> Yeah me too . Oh ! Can we stop at the shop really fast ? I lost my makeup bag at the airport and I want to pick up a few things .
<user0> Will you take long ?
<user1> No ! Five minutes I promise !
<user0> Come on ! We have been here for almost an hour ! I thought you said you were only going to get a few things ! How long does it take you to pick out a lipstick and some nail polish !
<user1> Are you crazy ? You have no idea what you are talking about ! Just for my eyes I have to get eye-liner , an eyelash curler , eye shadow , an eyebrow pencil and mascara . Then I need to get foundation , liq
<user0> Whoa whoa whoa ! Are you nuts ? How much is all this going to cost ? I ' m looking at the price at each one of these little things and it ' s outrageous ! This is basically a crayon !
<user1> What about you ? You spend as much or more money on your razors , after shave , cologne and gel ! Not to mention how much you spend on clothes and ...
<user0> Fine ! Get the stupid thirty dollar crayon !
<user1> Yes , but I think I'll have orange juice first .
<user0> Do you feel like having anything to eat ?
<user1> Well , I think I'll try the pancakes . How about you ?
<user0> Sounds great . That's just what I feel like having .
<user1> What are you waiting for ? Rip ‘ em open !
<user0> Wow ... this shirt is nice , but looks big .
<user1> It's nice , but how much did you end up paying ?
<user0> With the shipping included--seventy dollars .
<user1> Hmm ... not so hot . They sell them here for about that .
<user1> I'm not sure . I was thinking of making a vegetable .
<user0> What kind of vegetable are you thinking about making ?
<user1> Do you know what kind of vegetable you want to eat ?
<user0> Why don't you make some corn ?
<user1> How would you like the corn ?
<user0> I don't understand what you mean .
<user1> Do you want it boiled , grilled , or microwaved ?
<user0> Why don't you grill it ?
<user1> That's how you want it ?
<user0> Yeah , that sounds delicious .
<user1> Okay , I'll grill some corn then .
<user1> I'm sorry . Something is wrong with my taxi .
<user0> Where does it go wrong ?
<user1> Let me stop my car for check . Oh , my god . I got a flat tyre .
<user0> Can it keep going ?
<user1> Sorry . You'd better get off for taking another taxi .
<user1> I am going to buy some food to cook for supper .
<user0> Good . I wanna come with you .
<user1> How strange ! Our little emperor now asks to help out with shopping .
<user0> We learnt about vegetables and meat at school . But I never see the real thing .
<user1> Wow , that's something new . Let's go ! What's this , honey ?
<user0> Er , is it cabbage ?
<user1> Cabbage ? Is that what they teach at school now ? OK , honey , it's spinage .
<user0> Yeah , I know , this is Popeye's favorite food .
<user1> There we go .
<user0> Mom , come here . I know this , it is carrot , am I right ?
<user1> Bingo ! It's dark outside , Let's hurry up .
<user1> That will be no problem . We never use any kind of inferior packaging . Your goods will be safe .
<user0> Good . Can we ask you to put a country of origin mark on each container ?
<user1> We always do that , but I will make a point to check it for you since it is so important .
<user0> Do you always put a quality mark on each container ? For this shipment it is crucial to us that you do .
<user1> We don't usually do that unless we are asked to . I'lI tell my staff to take care of this for you .
<user0> Thanks . This shipment is so important to us there cannot be any foul-ups .
<user1> Which tea do you prefer , black or jasmine tea ?
<user0> I like both . Could you show me some samples ?
<user1> Of course , here you are . These are Black tea from Anti , Oolong tea from Guangdong , Oolong tea from Fujisan and Longing tea from Xinu . The new products are Curls Black tea , Crushed Black tea and so on . They are the best sellers in many countries .
<user0> Oh , such a variety . All of them are excellent both in color and flavour . No wonder our people like China ' s tea better than any other kind . Could you give me some idea of the prices ?
<user1> Here is our price list . All the prices on the list are subject to our final confirmation . You can see the prices are reasonable .
<user0> I'd like you to quote me CIF Karachi .
<user1> Right . Could you tell us the quantity you require so that we can work out the offer ?
<user0> Yes . I want 500 kilograms of Black tea from Anti , 200 kilograms of Jasmine tea from Hangzhou and 100 kilograms of Crushed Black tea , first grade .
<user1> Good . We will make the offer tomorrow afternoon . Is that all right ?
<user0> Yes . See you tomorrow afternoon .
<user1> I ' Ve been having trouble breathing lately .
<user0> Have you had any type of cold lately ?
<user1> No , I haven ' t had a cold . I just have a heavy feeling in my chest when I try to breathe .
<user0> Do you have any allergies that you know of ?
<user1> No , I don ' t have any allergies that I know of .
<user0> Does this happen all the time or mostly when you are active ?
<user1> It happens a lot when I work out .
<user0> I am going to send you to a pulmonary specialist who can run tests on you for asthma .
<user1> Thank you for your help , doctor .
<user1> We are sorry , but single rooms have been occupied .
<user0> What's the room rate ? It is a little expensive for me , do you have any other rooms ?
<user1> Then how about this room , with just shower ?
<user0> May I see the room ? I ' ll take this room . Is the rate for the room only ?
<user1> No , sir . The tax is included .
<user1> I have chosen 15 candidates . The first round interview is tomorrow .
<user0> The first round ?
<user1> Right . We'll choose the 4 best candidates and have them come back for a second interview . The top one of them will be the one we will hire .

<user0> How about retirement ?
<user1> We still offer a traditional retirement plan that pays out if you stay with the company for 5 years or more .

<user1> We offer full tuition reimbursement for job related classes .
<user0> Where is the benefits office ?
<user1> It's on the second floor in Suite 201 .
<user1> I spoke to a girl named Claire on the phone ; it's about losing my card and everything .
<user0> What I need you to do first is fill in these forms , with as much detail as possible . Then we can get you a new card .
<user1> So , I can get my new card today ?
<user0> I'm sorry , Sir , the full procedure can take up to 7 days to process everything .
<user1> 7 days ! What am I supposed to do for money until then ?
<user0> If you bring some ID with you , it's possible for you to make a withdrawal over the counter if you need to . But unfortunately , without your new card you cannot use the ATM , so all withdrawals must be made within working hours .
<user1> Dad ! I don't have time ! I'll be late for school !
<user0> You won't make it through the day without breakfast .
<user1> Dad , I never eat breakfast .
<user0> Breakfast is brain food . Maybe that's why your grades are Suffering .
<user1> Uh ! Dad !
<user0> Don't ' Uh , Dad ' me . Sit down and have some lovely breakfast .
<user1> Alright . You win . Please pass the brain food .
<user1> Are you nuts ?
<user1> Really ? I didn't expect that .
<user0> It's possible because everyone wants to travel during the holiday weekend .
<user1> I should have booked the tickets in advance .
<user0> Take it easy . I'll like you know if anyone decides to cancel his reservation .
<user1> I am so glad they called you . It feels like something is really wrong with my stomach !

<user0> Have you been feeling this way for awhile ?
<user1> I started feeling kind of sick last night after dinner , but this morning the pain got really bad !

<user0> Do you go jogging or do you go to a health club ?
<user1> I joined Samsung Health Club a couple of months ago .

<user1> I usually spend 30 minutes on the bicycle for the Carpio , and then I lift weight for about 45 minutes .
<user0> How often do you go ?
<user1> I want to go four times a week , but I'm too lazy . Last week , I only went to workout once .
<user1> Hi , Alex !
<user0> Where have you been ?
<user1> I just got back from London .
<user0> How was your flight ?
<user1> It was OK . There was a lot of turbulence , though .
<user0> That ' s too bad . how long was the flight ?
<user1> It was 10 hours .
<user0> Did you have a layover ?
<user1> Yes , in paris , France .
<user0> Did you buy anything in the duty-free stores ?
<user1> Yes . I bought two boxed of chocolate ? one for me and one for you !
<user0> Oh , you didn ' t have to ...
<user1> It was nothing .
<user1> Sure . Our special wine today is a 1989 Chardonnay .
<user0> That sounds pretty good ! How much is it ?
<user1> It's $ 4.25 cents by the glass . The whole bottle is $ 22.5 .
<user0> I'd like a bottle please .
<user1> I'll need to see your ID please .
<user0> Here you go .
<user1> Sorry about the inconvenience , you look so young . I had make sure you are over 21 years old .
<user1> Good . I'll take care of it .
<user0> Wait a second , Vince . You know what ? Why don't you let me handle it ?
<user1> Are you sure ? Do you have somebody in mind ?
<user0> Yeah . Let me see if he'll do it , and I'll get back to you .
<user1> OK . Just keep in mind it has to be somebody who can get along with Elvin .
<user0> Don't sweat it . I know just the guy .
<user1> I needed to ask you a question .
<user0> Ask away .
<user1> How many hours of the behind-the-wheel course do I need to take ?
<user0> Why do you need to take the course ?
<user1> I want to get my license .
<user0> You have to do six hours behind the wheel .
<user1> How many days do I need to finish the course ?
<user0> You can't finish in less than three days .
<user1> Is that all ?
<user0> There's nothing else to it .
<user1> That sounds easy enough .
<user1> Wait a moment , mom .
<user0> I'm mad ! I said now ! Turn off the TV , and do it now .
<user1> Mom , just ten more minutes . The show is going to be over soon .
<user0> Peter , if you don't do it soon , I will throw your toys in the trash can .
<user1> Yes , I do . How can I help you ?
<user0> Well , I've just arrived in my room , but there are no instructions in English about the facilities available ! Could you help me for a moment ?
<user1> Of course not . What exactly would you like to know ?
<user0> First , what is the number for room service ?
<user1> It's 1200 . Room service is available 24 hours a day .
<user0> Very good . Now , could you help me to adjust the air conditioning , please ? It's too hot in my room .
<user1> Yes , the control unit is on the wall next to the bathroom . Is 24 ° C all right ?
<user0> Yes , that's perfect . Another thing , if need more items for the mini-bar , which Number should I call ?
<user1> You should call the Housekeeping Department on 2300 . They will replace any stock for you immediately .
<user0> I see . So , is it possible to make international phone calls from my room ?
<user1> That's no problem . Just dial 9 to get an outside line , and then dial the number as usual .
<user0> Well , thanks a lot for your help .
<user1> No problem , sir . If there's anything else you need , you can find me at the desk by the elevator , or you can call housekeeping if I'm not there .
<user0> OK , goodbye .
<user1> Goodbye , sir .
<user1> No problem . Would you like some artificial carnations ?
<user0> Oh , no . Carnations are not very elegant . Artificial flowers have no passion .
<user1> How much did you want to spend ?
<user0> Money is no object .
<user1> Our most elegant flower is Golden Lily .
<user0> I will take ten .
<user1> Do you want to add some baby's breath for that ? They are equally popular now .
<user0> Of course . Can I have it delivered to my girlfriend's house this afternoon ?
<user1> Yes , but there is a five dollars delivery charge .
<user0> That's ok . Here is the address .
<user1> Good Morning , I have a bad cough , and I want to see an internist .
<user0> Do you have a registration card ?
<user1> No , I don ' t . I ' m a tourist .
<user0> Then you need to register as a new patient . Can I have a look at you ID card ? I need your name , age , occupation , address and contacting number .
<user1> Here you are .
<user0> Thanks . Which kind of medicine do you prefer , western medicine or traditional Chinese medicine ?
<user1> I ' d like to try traditional Chinese medicine . I heard it really works quite well if you know what you're doing .
<user0> All right . Yes , he does . The registration fee is 7 yuan , please .
<user1> I'm just poring over some brochures about various car models .
<user0> Oh , so you're thinking about buying a new car ?
<user1> Yeah , it looks that way . My wife has been bugging me about it . I thought we could probably survive without one , but with a baby on the way , maybe it is time to get a car .
<user0> So this would be your first automobile ?
<user1> That's right . For quite a few years , I rode a bicycle to work . Then I got a motorbike .
<user0> Yeah , I think I can understand your wife's position . Asking her to ride on a motorcycle when she's pregnant is a tall order .
<user1> Oh ... I don't let her ride with me . It's just too dangerous . She takes the bus to work , but it is sometimes difficult to get a seat and it's crowded and hot .
<user0> So it's time to buy your very first car ! Wow , that's exciting !
<user1> Yes , but it's also a pretty big financial responsibility .
<user0> Yeah . I still remember my first car . It was an old clunker that my dad gave me when I turned 17 . I drove it around for a couple of years until I scraped together enough money to buy a better secondhand car .
<user1> I'm having a hard time deciding which model is best for us .
<user0> Yeah , it is a tough call . Each one has its pros and cons . Are you looking for a sedan ?
<user1> Yes , I'd like a Jeep , but my wife says we have to get a comfortable sedan for long drives home to see her relatives .
<user0> I'd advise you to listen to your wife . She will be sitting in the back taking care of the kids so whatever she prefers is probably the best choice .
<user1> I'd like to send a fax to Shenzhen .
<user0> Is it a photograph or a document ?
<user1> Each of both .
<user0> Could I see both of them ?
<user1> Here you are .
<user0> You can't send this document ; it is not clear enough to send . The photograph is all right .
<user1> Well , how long will it take to arrive in Shenzhen ?
<user0> Couple of minutes .
<user1> Great . How much ?
<user0> 5 $ . You should change another much clearer photograph for fax .
<user1> Thank you . I will deal with it .
<user1> Here you are .
<user0> For business or pleasure ?
<user1> Business .
<user0> Thank you . Have a pleasant stay .
<user1> Oh , yes . May I sit on the grass ?
<user0> No , you mustn't sit on the grass . Don't you see the notes ?
<user1> Yes , I can see it . But what's on it ?
<user0> It says ' Keep off the grass ! '
<user1> Well , there's a bench under the tree . We can sit there .
<user0> Be careful . You can't smoke here .
<user1> Why not ?
<user0> Can't you see the notes there ? It says ' No smoking here ' .
<user1> Do you have a reservation ?
<user0> Yes , I called you last week from New York . My name is George Lee .
<user1> Wait a second , PLS . Yes , Mr . Lee , we have a room reserved for you . How long do you plan to stay ?
<user0> Probably two days . My wife will join me tomorrow . Then we will decide when to leave for Seattle .
<user1> Would you sign the register , PLS ?
<user0> By the way , does my room have a private bath ?
<user1> Certainly , every room in this hotel has a private bath .
<user0> Does my room have twin beds or a double ? I prefer a room with twin beds .
<user1> Your room has twin beds , Mr.Lee . It also has a view . I am sure you will like it . This is your key . It's on the eighth floor room 801 . The elevator's over there .
<user0> Thank you . One more thing , where is your restaurant ?
<user1> The restaurant is on the second floor . We also have a cafeteria on the top floor . If you would like something to drink , you can either call room service or come down here . The bar is right behind the lobby .
<user0> Thank you , you are very kind !
<user1> You are welcome !
<user1> Where do you live ?
<user0> I live up in Altadena .
<user1> The 264 will take you there .
<user0> It goes all the way there ?
<user1> I know for a fact that it goes to the station .
<user0> What street would I catch it on ?
<user1> If you go to Altadena Drive , you can catch it there .
<user0> I didn't know that bus went to the Gold Line station .
<user1> Yup , it does .
<user0> Well , thanks for letting me know .
<user1> It was my pleasure .
<user1> I have a problem .
<user0> What ' s the problem ?
<user1> Someone else is making charges on my debit card .
<user0> I need to see a statement for your debit card .
<user1> I have it right here .
<user0> Can you show me which charges you ' re referring to ?
<user1> The last four charges .
<user0> We will need to do an investigation on this .
<user1> How long will that take ?
<user0> We ' ll have to freeze payment on those charges until the investigation is finished .
<user1> I really appreciate your help .
<user1> Yeah , sure . Let's go .
<user0> Buckle up .
<user1> All right . Now what ?
<user0> Now you put the key in the ignition and start the car .
<user1> Which direction should I take ?
<user0> Make a left on this next street .
<user1> Tell me how far to go .
<user0> Keep going until I tell you to stop .
<user1> Okay , but let me know ahead of time .
<user0> That's all for today , so park right there .
<user1> That was great . Thanks for taking me driving .
<user1> How's this one ?
<user0> Oh , I need a small one , otherwise my luggage will be overweight .
<user1> What about this one ?
<user0> Oh , this is fine .
<user1> Hi . Is there a special rate for a group reservation ?
<user0> Yes . There is a 20 % to 40 % discount . It depends on the season.During the summer the discount is 20 % . During the winter it is 40 % .
<user1> I need five single rooms in October . How much of a discount can I get ?
<user0> Our summer season ended in September . So the discount will be 40 % . That ' s a good deal . Would you prefer rooms with a front view or rear view ?
<user1> Front view , please .
<user0> What date and time will you be checking in ?
<user1> October 25th around 2:00 in the afternoon .
<user0> We need you to send a deposit for 1/3 of the bill . You can send the check , or you can use the credit card .
<user1> Ok . I ' ll send a check .
<user0> Could you tell me your name , address and phone number , please ?
<user1> Sure . My name is Anderson . My address is 109 Ferguson East , Holton . And my phone number is 309 789 1267 .
<user0> Thanks .
<user1> It's about 3 kilometers .
<user0> Shall we have a rest here ? I am tired out .
<user1> Why not walk further to the tree over there ?
<user0> Good idea . So we Can rest in the shadow of the tree .
<user1> Oh , what's up ?
<user0> I locked myself out . What do you suggest I do ?
<user1> Well , the best thing to do is to go down to the front desk and ask for a duplicate key .
<user1> What happened to you ? You look like you got hit by a tornado !
<user0> I just got back from fighting the crowds .
<user1> You mean at the mall ? Was there a sale ?
<user0> Yeah . For five minutes , everything was half off . It was total chaos ...
<user1> Cool !
<user0> Grabbing , pushing and shoving ...
<user1> We don't have a swimming pool , sir , but we do have swim stations in the gym .
<user0> I never heard of a swim station . Is that like a train or bus station ?
<user1> It's just a deep bathtub with a current of water that you swim against .
<user0> Holy cow ! I never heard of such a thing . How much do they cost ?
<user1> As a guest , sir , you pay nothing .
<user0> This sounds better every second . Now , when can I use the stations ?
<user1> If you want to swim , you can visit the gym any day between 7 a . m . and 10 p . m .
<user0> Oh , boy ! This is going to be great . I'm going to the gym right now !
<user1> I'm sure you'll enjoy your workout , sir . Everyone seems to like the swim stations .
<user1> Hi , Christine . How ' s it going ?
<user0> Fine , thanks . Mr . Emory would like to meet with Mr . Macmillan tomorrow afternoon . Can you take a look at his book ?
<user1> Sure , just a second . All right , what time ?
<user1> Yes , I want to book a room .
<user0> Sure . What kind of room do you like ?
<user1> Well , could you let me see the room ?
<user0> Ok . What about this one ?
<user1> It's fine . What beautiful scenery outside the window ! I think this one will do .
<user0> I am glad you like it .
<user1> Centrum ? We have bottles of thirty and one hundred tablets . Which kind do you want ?
<user0> Give me one bottle of one hundred tablets .
<user1> And what kind of toothbrushes would you like ?
<user0> Can I have a look at them ?
<user1> Sure . This brand is supposed to be very good , but they're expensive . Those are new products . They come in several colors and sizes . There is also hard , soft , and medium .
<user0> Are they cheaper ?
<user1> This one is 10 % off . That one has no reduction , but you can get a free tube of toothpaste with six toothbrushes .
<user0> So if I buy a dozen , I'll get two free tubes of toothpaste ?
<user1> That's right .
<user0> Good . I ' ll take a dozen of them then .
<user1> And here is your aspirin . What else did you say you want ?
<user0> Baby's wipes . Johnson's .

<user0> Thanks . That'll be all .
<user1> What kind of keys ?
<user0> Five keys and a small foot ornament .

<user0> Well , can you help me look for it ? That's my first time here .
<user1> Sure . It's my pleasure . I'd like to help you look for the missing keys .
<user0> It's very kind of you .
<user1> It's not a big deal.Hey , I found them .

<user0> All right . And here's your deposit book .
<user1> Thank you . Goodbye .
<user0> Goodbye .
<user1> Good morning !
<user0> Mr . Smith , did you have a good journey ?
<user1> I just feel a little tired . You know , it took me 16 hours to get here .
<user0> You must take a rest today .
<user1> That's very kind of you , but I can do without a rest . I have long wanted to have a talk with you about the possibility of business between us .
<user0> We welcome good business . Anyhow , we know you must get tired by the flight , so we arrange a meeting tomorrow . Today you can have a good rest .
<user1> Thank you very much .
<user0> We hope your stay here a pleasant one !
<user1> I believe I will .
<user1> Let me see . It's 9
<user0> Is your watch right ?
<user1> I think so . I set it by the radio this morning .
<user0> By the way , can you tell me what the date it is today , and what day it is , please ?
<user1> Well , it's the 10th and on the Tuesday .
<user1> I'd like to leave this bag with you .
<user0> OK , sir . Is there anything valuable or breakable in it ?
<user1> Well ... there is a necklace in it .
<user0> Would you mind taking the necklace with you , or leaving it at the safe deposit box ?
<user1> Well , don't bother . I'll take it with me . Will that be all right ?
<user0> Thank you , sir . Here is your tag . This cloakroom is open till 11:00 p . m . , could you pick it up by then ?
<user1> Sure . thank you .
<user1> Let's go take a look at it . Do you have your ID with you ?
<user0> Yes , here it is .
<user1> Okay , I see the problem . You forgot your code , didn't you ?
<user0> How did you know ?
<user1> The machine gives you three attempts to enter the correct code and after that it assumes that you are not the real owner and confiscates it .
<user0> Oh . But can I have my card back now ?
<user1> Yes , I can get it for you but I need to go back inside the bank .
<user1> Her name is Rose.Why ?
<user0> She's so pretty . I'd like to make friends with her .
<user1> Oh , shut up.She ' s already got married .
<user1> Of course not . We have 50 channels in all .
<user0> Well . I am afraid it must be my fault . Can you send someone here to help me ?
<user1> OK . I will send a maid to your room right now .
<user1> I'm getting sleepy .
<user0> You've had so long a flight .
<user1> Time difference also makes me feel weak .
<user0> Oh , I forgot about it .
<user1> It's four o'clock in the morning in Chicago now , but it's time to go to bed in Shanghai .
<user0> Don't think so much . Take a good sleep and you'll feel better soon .
<user1> I'd like to reserve a table for two , my wife and I .
<user0> Yes , sir . What time would you like , sir ?
<user1> I'm not sure . Perhaps around 8 PM .
<user0> Fine , a reserve a table for two at 8 PM , sir , may I have your name , please ?
<user1> Juliet , Juliet Berman .
<user0> Thank you , Mr.Berman . and you prefer smoking or non-smoking ?
<user1> Non-smoking will be fine , please . But it is more important that you get a table by the window . It's our anniversary , and I'd like to be very special .
<user0> I'll try my best . With a toward to having with this tonight , Mr.Berman .
<user1> Thank you , goodbye .
<user0> Goodbye , and have a nice day .
<user1> Good morning . There is no reason to miss so beautiful a morning . Is that a new bird ?
<user0> Oh , yes , my daughter bought it yesterday . We call her Lulu .
<user1> It looks so cute . Is it a parrot ?
<user0> Yes . Just look at her colorful feathers . What else can it be ?
<user1> I see . It's interesting that there is also a parrot in my English book . His mane is Polly .
<user0> Really ? A foreign parrot !
<user1> He can speak English , too .
<user0> Maybe you can teach Lulu some English words .
<user1> Lulu . Lulu . Say hello . hello . Oh , she is so smart . Good bird .
<user1> an mp4 player ? why don't you buy a new cell phone ? You can find an mp4 player inside any of the latest cell phones .
<user0> Oh , that's a good idea . Perhaps I should have a try .
<user1> look at my cell phone . I can listen to music , watch movies , take pictures , play games , surf the web and download documents . It's just like a PAD .
<user0> that's cool . I can use the computer and the internet pretty well , but I'm a little bit slow in the latest trends of digital products .
<user1> that's Ok . you know , digital devices are becoming smaller and easier to carry , and they won't cost you too much .
<user0> yeah , if I buy a cell phone like this , I don't have to take a music player everywhere I go , and I can save the cost of buying an extra mp4 .
<user1> that's right . what's the flash memory of your old mp3 ?
<user0> 256MB .
<user1> then any cell phone can meet your need because they generally have memories of over 512MB .
<user1> A cheeseburger and an order of french fries would be great .
<user0> Would you like anything to drink ?
<user1> I feel like having a Coke .
<user0> That's a good idea . I think I'll join you .
<user1> It was pretty bumpy , also a bit long , all together about 5 hours .
<user0> That is a long flight . You had a layover too , is that right ? You must be tired .
<user1> Actually I feel quite rested . I was able to sleep on the plane .
<user0> Good ! Here , let me help you with your bag . Is it your first time to Seattle ? I'd be happy to take you around this city and show you the sights tonight if you're up to it .
<user1> That will be very nice . You're too kind .
<user0> I've already made a hotel reservation for you , let's go to the hotel first and drop off your things . Then , I'd like to have a drink so that we can get better acquainted . I've booked a table at an exclusive restaurant downtown . Afterwards , I've made arrangements to take you to see the city lights . Seattle ' s nightlife can be really quite exciting . How does that schedule sound to you ?
<user1> Sounds great . Thank you for your hospitality .
<user1> That's all right . I can manage .
<user0> Be careful ! The road is muddy.You might slip .
<user1> Thanks for the warning .
<user1> I'm so happy you remember , please come in and enjoy the party . Everyone's here , I'm sure you have a good time .
<user0> Brian , may I have a pleasure to have a dance with you ?
<user1> Ok .
<user0> This is really wonderful party .
<user1> Yes , you are always popular with everyone . and you look very pretty today .
<user0> Thanks , that's very kind of you to say . I hope my necklace goes with my dress , and they both make me look good I feel .
<user1> You look great , you are absolutely glowing .
<user0> Thanks , this is a fine party . We should have a drink together to celebrate your birthday
<user1> Where are you going to buy one ?
<user0> I'm really not sure .
<user1> You like my living room set , don't you ?
<user0> Where did you buy it ?
<user1> I found mine at IKEA .
<user0> Are they expensive ?
<user1> Everything I got from IKEA cost me a couple thousand .
<user0> Is the furniture crafted well ?
<user1> The furniture isn't built cheap .
<user0> I'll pay the money , as long as I'm getting what I pay for .
<user1> You will feel comfortable paying the money .
<user1> We need lots of things . I ' ll make a list . We need a bag of sugar , a loaf of bread and a crate of beer .
<user0> A crate of beer ? Why do we need that ?
<user1> Just joking . I would like to get a few bottles of beer though . We also need a liter of cooking oil .
<user0> we can buy a three-liter bottle . It works out cheaper per liter . We should buy a packet of butter and a few pints of milk too .
<user1> I ' d like to get a jar of strawberry jam and a bottle of tomato ketchup . Do we need any meat ?
<user0> I think we should get half a kilo of minced beef and a few pork chops .
<user1> Ok . Let ' s not forget fruit and vegetables . We need a bunch of bananas , a kilo of tomatoes and a bag of potatoes .
<user0> We should also get a tube of toothpaste and a bar of soap . Let ' s get a tub of ice cream too . We can treat ourselves .
<user1> Ok . We should get a few tins of tuna . Anything else ?
<user0> I ' d like a few cans of coke . We also need a dozen eggs and half a dozen sausages .
<user1> let ' s get a chunk of cheese too . Is that everything .
<user0> I think so . I ' Ve got the shopping list , so let ' s go .
<user1> Mr . Thomas , this is a standard size .
<user0> Can you supply us right away ?
<user1> Yes , we have plenty on hand right now .
<user0> Good , we'll take 500 suits .
<user1> OK , thanks for the order .
<user1> Nothing special .
<user1> It's wet and rains a lot.But right now it's the golden season to take a tour there . It is fine there almost everyday .
<user0> That's great . Will I feel hot there ? I feel sensitive to heat .
<user1> It's not so hot as it is here .
<user1> Hmm . That must be the DVD player that another one of my friends donated . He owns one of the largest electronics stores in Taipei !
<user0> They're picking a name ... It's ... Darryl from marketing ! Rats !
<user1> Don't worry ! There are a lot more prizes ! I know , because the prizes are all from companies that I work with !
<user0> Hmm ... Darryl doesn't look like the red underwear type ...
<user1> When will I know your decision ?
<user0> Can we get in touch with you by e-mail ? Is this convenient for you ?
<user1> It ' s quite convenient .
<user0> Thank you for your interest in our company .
<user1> OK . Thank you very much .
<user1> It can ' t be time to get up yet .
