<user0> I'll be willing to come and talk about the financing of our imports . __eou__ <user1> It can be solved by drawing a draft on us at 90 days sight . __eou__ <user0> What about a draft at 120 days sight ? __eou__ <user1> All right . But we demand the draft be accepted by a bank acceptable to us . __eou__ <user0> A bank's acceptance will add to the costs of our imports . You can rest assured that we will accept the draft and honour it when it comes due . __eou__ <user1> Then we will be in a position to arrange for a loan from our bank . You know we exports would like to have our investments returned as early as possible . __eou__ <user0> I hope this transaction will pave the way for further business relations between our two countries .

<user0> So tell me , what's the difference between the Board of Directors , the CEO , and the stockholders ? They all seems ot be the same group of people to me ... __eou__ <user1> No , there's a definite difference . You know , the stockholders are the people who own the company ... they're the financial control system . Then there's the CEO — the chief executive officer . He's the hot shot , the main guy who is the boss . If there is only one person with absolute power in the organization , everyone knows that the power will go to their head . It's too dangerous . That's the reason for a Board of Directors . The board is made up of people who are experts in the industry . They could be related to the organization , but more commonly , they are independent and non-biased .

The longer the term , the higher the Dividend you earn . This is because it is calculated at the Compound Interest Rate .

Or maybe , you may give the floor to him and keep listening as if very interested .

We might as well call the whole deal off . __eou__ <user0> What I mean is that we'll never be able to come down to your price . The gap is too great . __eou__ <user1> I think it unwise for either of us to be inflexible . How about meeting each other halfway ? __eou__ <user0> What's your proposal ? __eou__ <user1> Your unit price is 100 dollars higher than we want . Well , I suggest we meet each other halfway . __eou__ <user0> Do you mean a further reduction of 50 dollars in our price ? That's impossible ! __eou__ <user1> What would you suggest ? __eou__ <user0> The best we can do is another 30 dollars off . That's definitely the lowest we can go . __eou__ <user1> That still leaves a gap of 20 dollars . Let's meet each other half-away again and split the difference ; I think this is a price we can both be satisfied with .

As a lot of people have chosen that day to get married , it is hard to find a hotel that isn't too expensive . __eou__ <user0> Have you tried The Peninsula Palace Beijing ? My wedding reception was held there and they did an excellent job . __eou__ <user1> Yes , we called , but it is booked up . The only choice is the Regent Beijing but we haven't made up our minds yet . __eou__ <user0> It's an excellent hotel . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive . __eou__ <user1> That's why we want to have a look at other hotels . We don ' t want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception . __eou__ <user0> I guess you're right . I can help you ask other hotels . I am sure there are probably some available . __eou__ <user1> Thank you .

You need to learn how to drive . You're lucky you didn't get killed .

I know the laws of the road . I'm not worried . __eou__ <user0> I have a cell phone in my car . Now it's probably on the floor on the passenger side.Why don't you get it for me , and then I can call the police ? __eou__ <user1> Alright . __eou__ <user0> It doesn't work . It looks like it's broken . I need to get to a hospital . You should drive me there . __eou__ <user1> Oh , yeah ? It's better if we make a police report first .

That's why when he entered the final , I was so excited .
<user0> Did you watch the final last night ? My favorite singer won ! __eou__ <user1> Oh , I love him too . He not only sings well but also shows perseverance when he encounters difficulties in the contest . __eou__ <user0> Yeah , he got booted after his initial performance in the audition , but he did not give up . He then tried at another two auditions . __eou__ <user1> He had barely survived the third audition and finally got a chance to advance in the contest . Fortunately , in the third audition , he has won popularity among the audience . And that's when I started to notice him . __eou__ <user0> Me too . __eou__ <user1> Before he made the top three , I was so nervous . I just fear that he might be knocked out . __eou__ <user0> Yeah , there're so many excellent candidates out there . Who knows which one will make it to the final ? __eou__ <user1> Absolutely . That's why when he entered the final , I was so excited . __eou__ <user0> He really did a great job in the finale , especially in the PK round . He performed so well that the majority of the audience cast their votes for him .
